In this protocol, we describe a flow cytometry-based method for the analysis of the intracellular levels of ROS in vital leukemic cells in response to the histone deacetylase inhibitor vorinostat.

1,Source Printer Classification Using Printer Specific Local Texture Descriptor,"Joshi, Sharad; Khanna, Nitin","The knowledge of the source printer can help in printed text document authentication, copyright ownership, and provide important clues about the author of a fraudulent document along with his/her potential means and motives. The development of automated systems for classifying printed documents based on their source printer, using image processing techniques, is gaining a lot of attention in multimedia forensics. Currently, the state-of-the-art systems require that the font of letters present in the test documents of unknown origin must be available in those used for training the classifier. In this paper, we attempt to take the first step toward overcoming this limitation. Specifically, we introduce a novel printer specific local texture descriptor. The highlight of our technique is the use of encoding and regrouping strategy based on small linear-shaped structures composed of pixels having similar intensity and gradient. The results of experiments performed on two separate datasets show that: 1) on a publicly available dataset, the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms for characters printed in the same font and reduces the confusion between the printers of same brand and model on another dataset having documents printed in four different fonts, the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods for cross font experiments.",Printer classification; local texture patterns; local binary pattern; forgery detection; printer dataset
2,Plasma-processed CoSn/RGO nanocomposite: A low-cost and sustainable counter electrode for dye-sensitized solar cells,"Omelianovych, Oleksii; Larina, Liudmila L.; Oh, Hyo-Jun; Park, Eunhee; Van-Duong Dao; Choi, Ho-Suk","The high cost of state-of-the-art Pt counter electrodes (CEs) hinders the large-scale applications of dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs). The development of Pt-free catalysts while maintaining state-of-the-art catalytic activity for CE materials is one mean to reduce costs. Here, CoxSn1-x/reduced graphene oxide (RGO) (0 <= x <= 1) nanohybrids were synthesized and employed as inexpensive, stable, and earth-abundant CEs in DSCs. The synthesis was performed through the plasma-assisted reduction of the oxygen functional groups of the graphene oxide along with the immobilization of bimetallic nanoparticles (NPs) on the surface of RGO. The optimization of the composition of the alloy NPs for the highest efficiency of DSC yields the Co0.9Sn0.1/RGO nanocomposite. The highest device performance correlates well with the experimentally obtained lowest charge transfer resistance in conjunction with the highest electrocatalytic activity of the Co0.9Sn0.1/RGO CE. The DSC employed the synthesized CE showed good stability over long term operation. Both the developed CoSn/RGO nanohybrids and the strategy used for their synthesis are cost-effective. Our results provide economically implementable and green nanotechnology for efficient and stable DSCs required for commercialization.",Plasma reduction; Bimatalic alloy CoxSn1-x; Reduced graphene oxide; Nanohybrids; Counter electrode; Dye-sensitized solar cells
3,Immediate Antiretroviral Therapy: The Need for a Health Equity Approach,"Mgbako, Ofole; E. Sobieszczyk, Magdalena; Olender, Susan; Gordon, Peter; Zucker, Jason; Tross, Susan; Castor, Delivette; H. Remien, Robert","Immediate antiretroviral therapy (iART), defined as same-day initiation of ART or as soon as possible after diagnosis, has recently been recommended by global and national clinical care guidelines for patients newly diagnosed with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Based on San Francisco's Rapid ART Program Initiative for HIV Diagnoses (RAPID) model, most iART programs in the US condense ART initiation, insurance acquisition, housing assessment, and mental health and substance use evaluation into an initial visit. However, the RAPID model does not explicitly address structural racism and homophobia, HIV-related stigma, medical mistrust, and other important factors at the time of diagnosis experienced more poignantly by African American, Latinx, men who have sex with men (MSM), and transgender patient populations. These factors negatively impact initial and subsequent HIV care engagement and exacerbate significant health disparities along the HIV care continuum. While iART has improved time to viral suppression and linkage to care rates, its association with retention in care and viral suppression, particularly in vulnerable populations, remains controversial. Considering that in the US the HIV epidemic is sharply defined by healthcare disparities, we argue that incorporating an explicit health equity approach into the RAPID model is vital to ensure those who disproportionately bear the burden of HIV are not left behind.",HIV; antiretroviral therapy; rapid; health equity
4,Design and analysis of an ultra-low-power LC quadrature VCO,"Lee, Kin Keung; Bryant, Carl; Tormanen, Markus; Sjoland, Henrik","This paper presents the design of an ultra-low-power LC quadrature VCO (QVCO). It is designed in a single-poly seven-metal 65-nm CMOS process. Several aspects of state-of-the-art QVCO design are addressed, for example tank design and circuit topologies in nano-meter CMOS technology. To minimize power dissipation, an inductor with a high LQ product of 188 nH at 2.4 GHz, and a self-resonant frequency (f(SR)) of 3.8 GHz, was designed. According to post-layout simulations, the power dissipation is below 300 mu W at a 0.6 V supply. At this supply, the simulated tuning range and phase noise at 1 MHz offset are 10.3% (2.26-2.5 GHz) and -109.6 dBc/Hz respectively. The phase noise figure of merit (FoM) is better than 182.5 dB at all supply voltages of interest, which is competitive to other state-of-the-art QVCOs.",Varactor; Spiral inductor; Quadrature generation; VCO; RF; CMOS
5,A Design Space Exploration Framework for Convolutional Neural Networks Implemented on Edge Devices,"Tsimpourlas, Foivos; Papadopoulos, Lazaros; Bartsokas, Anastasios; Soudris, Dimitrios","Deploying convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in embedded devices that operate at the edges of Internet of Things (IoT) networks provides various advantages in terms of performance, energy efficiency, and security in comparison with the alternative approach of transmitting large volumes of data for processing to the cloud. However, the implementation of CNNs on low power embedded devices is challenging due to the limited computational resources they provide and to the large resource requirements of state-of-the-art CNNs. In this paper, we propose a framework for the efficient deployment of CNNs in low power processor-based architectures used as edge devices in IoT networks. The framework leverages design space exploration (DSE) techniques to identify efficient implementations in terms of execution time and energy consumption. The exploration parameter is the utilization of hardware resources of the edge devices. The proposed framework is evaluated using a set of 6 state-of-the-art CNNs deployed in the Intel/Movidius Myriad2 low power embedded platform. The results show that using the maximum available amount of resources is not always the optimal solution in terms of performance and energy efficiency. Fine-tuned resource management based on DSE, reduces the execution time up to 3.6% and the energy consumption up to 7.7% in comparison with straightforward implementations.",Convolutional neural networks (CNNs); design space exploration (DSE); embedded systems
6,ESKAPE Act Plus: Pathway Activation Analysis for Bacterial Pathogens,"Katja Koeppen,Thomas H Hampton,Samuel L Neff,Bruce A Stanton,Katja Koeppen,Thomas H Hampton,Samuel L Neff,Bruce A Stanton","The last 20 years have witnessed an explosion in publicly available gene expression and proteomic data and new tools to help researchers analyze these data. Tools typically include statistical approaches to identify differential expression, integrate prior knowledge, visualize results, and suggest how differential expression relates to changes in phenotype. Here, we provide a simple web-based tool that bridges some of the gaps between the functionality available to those studying eukaryotes and those studying prokaryotes. Specifically, our Shiny web application ESKAPE Act PLUS allows researchers to upload results of high-throughput bacterial gene or protein expression experiments from 13 species, including the six ESKAPE pathogens, to our system and receive (i) an analysis of which KEGG pathways or GO terms are significantly activated or repressed, (ii) visual representations of the magnitude of activation or repression in each category, and (iii) detailed diagrams showing known relationships between genes in each regulated KEGG pathway and fold changes of individual genes. Importantly, our statistical approach does not require users to identify which genes or proteins are differentially expressed. ESKAPE Act PLUS provides high-quality statistics and graphical representations not available using other web-based systems to assess whether prokaryotic biological functions are activated or repressed by experimental conditions. To our knowledge, ESKAPE Act PLUS is the first application that provides pathway activation analysis and pathway-level visualization of gene or protein expression for prokaryotes. IMPORTANCE ESKAPE pathogens are bacteria of concern because they develop antibiotic resistance and can cause life-threatening infections, particularly in more susceptible immunocompromised people. ESKAPE Act PLUS is a user-friendly web application that will advance research on ESKAPE and other pathogens commonly studied by the biomedical community by allowing scientists to infer biological phenotypes from the results from high-throughput bacterial gene or protein expression experiments. ESKAPE Act PLUS currently supports analysis of 23 strains of bacteria from 13 species and can also be used to re-analyze publicly available data to generate new findings and hypotheses for follow-up experiments.",ESKAPE; ESKAPE pathogens; GO terms; KEGG; Prokaryotes; Shiny; Shiny web application; bacteria; gene ontology; pathogens; pathway activation analysis; prokaryotes; web application.

Notwithstanding substantial scope, the reticular synthesis of 3D COFs from pre-designed building units leading to new network topologies yet remains a demanding task owing to the shortage of 3D building units and inadequate reversibility of the linkages between the building units. In this work, by linking a tetragonal prism (8-connected) node with a square planar (4-connected) node, we report the first 3D COF with scu-c topology. The new COF, namely, TUS-84, features a two-fold interpenetrated structure with well-defined porosity and a Brunauer-Emmett-Teller surface area of 679 m2 g-1.

8,Objective Detection of Eloquent Axonal Pathways to Minimize Postoperative Deficits in Pediatric Epilepsy Surgery Using Diffusion Tractography and Convolutional Neural Networks,"Xu, Haotian; Dong, Ming; Lee, Min-Hee; O'Hara, Nolan; Asano, Eishi; Jeong, Jeong-Won","Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have recently been used in biomedical imaging applications with great success. In this paper, we investigated the classification performance of CNN models on diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) streamlines defined by functional MRI (fMRI) and electrical stimulation mapping (ESM). To learn a set of discriminative and interpretable features from the extremely unbalanced dataset, we evaluated different CNN architectures with multiple loss functions (e.g., focal loss and center loss) and a soft attention mechanism and compared our models with current state-of-the-art methods. Through extensive experiments on streamlines collected from 70 healthy children and 70 children with focal epilepsy, we demonstrated that our deep CNN model with focal and central losses and soft attention outperforms all existing models in the literature and provides clinically acceptable accuracy (73%-100%) for the objective detection of functionally important white matter pathways, including ESM determined eloquent areas such as primary motors, aphasia, speech arrest, auditory, and visual functions. The findings of this paper encourage further investigations to determine if DWI-CNN analysis can serve as a noninvasive diagnostic tool during pediatric presurgical planning by estimating not only the location of essential cortices at the gyral level but also the underlying fibers connecting these cortical areas to minimize or predict postsurgical functional deficits. This paper translates an advanced CNN model to clinical practice in the pediatric population where currently available approaches (e.g., ESM and fMRI) are suboptimal.

9,MILP Optimized Management of Domestic PV-Battery Using Two Days-Ahead Forecasts,"Sorour, Ameena; Fazeli, Meghdad; Monfared, Mohammad; Fahmy, Ashraf A.; Searle, Justin R.; Lewis, Richard P.","This paper proposes an Energy Management System (EMS) for domestic PV-battery applications with the aim of reducing the absolute net energy exchange with the utility grid by utilizing the two days-ahead energy forecasts in the optimization process. A Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) exploits two days-ahead energy demand and PV generation forecasts to schedule the day-ahead battery energy exchange with both the utility grid and the PV generator. The proposed scheme is tested using the real data of the Active Office Building (AOB) located in Swansea University, UK. Performance comparisons with state-of-the-art and the commercial EMS currently running at the AOB reveal that the proposed EMS increases the self-consumption of PV energy and at the same time reduces the total energy cost. The absolute net energy exchange with the grid and the total operating costs are reduced by 121% and 54% compared to the state-of-the-art and 194% and 8% when compared to the commercial EMS over a six-month period. Furthermore, the results show that the proposed method can reduce the energy bill by up to 46% for the same period compared to the state-of-the-art. The paper also investigates the effect of using different objective functions on the performance of the EMS and shows that the proposed EMS operate more efficiently when it is compared with another cost function that directly promotes reducing the absolute net energy exchange.",Batteries; Energy management; Costs; Energy exchange; State of charge; Buildings; Tariffs; Battery storage; energy management system; energy tariffs; forecast; mixed-integer linear programming; PV

11,Numerical Reflectance Compensation for Non-Lambertian Photometric Stereo,"Zheng, Qian; Kumar, Ajay; Shi, Boxin; Pan, Gang","The surface normal estimation from photometric stereo becomes less reliable when the surface reflectance deviates from the Lambertian assumption. The non-Lambertian effect can be explicitly addressed by physics modeling to the reflectance function, at the cost of introducing highly nonlinear optimization. This paper proposes a numerical compensation scheme that attempts to minimize the angular error to address the non-Lambertian photometric stereo problem. Due to the multifaceted influence in the modeling of non-Lambertian reflectance in photometric stereo, directly minimizing the angular errors of surface normal is a highly complex problem. We introduce an alternating strategy, in which the estimated reflectance can be temporarily regarded as a known variable, to simplify the formulation of angular error. To reduce the impact of inaccurately estimated reflectance in this simplification, we propose a numerical compensation scheme whose compensation weight is formulated to reflect the reliability of estimated reflectance. Finally, the solution for the proposed numerical compensation scheme is efficiently computed by using cosine difference to approximate the angular difference. The experimental results show that our method can significantly improve the performance of the state-of-the-art methods on both synthetic data and real data with small additive costs. Moreover, our method initialized by results from the baseline method (least-square-based) achieves the state-of-the-art performance on both synthetic data and real data with significantly smaller overall computation, i.e., about eight times faster compared with the state-of-the-art methods.",Photometric stereo; angular error; numerical reflectance compensation; non-Lambertian

QS allows groups of bacteria to sense population density and, in response to changing cell densities, to coordinate behaviors. The P. aeruginosa QS system consists of two complete circuits that involve acyl-homoserine lactone signals and a third system that uses quinolone signals. Together, these three QS circuits regulate the expression of hundreds of genes, many of which code for virulence factors. P. aeruginosa has become a model for studying the molecular biology of QS and the ecology and evolution of group behaviors in bacteria. In this chapter, we recount the history of discovery of QS systems in P. aeruginosa, discuss how QS relates to virulence and the ecology of this bacterium, and explore strategies to inhibit QS.

Thus, drawing on career construction theory, we test the positive effect of students' future orientation on their perceived employability by exploring the mediator of problem-based learning and the moderators of job market knowledge and proactive personality. Collecting our data via a time-lagged design (N = 368), we have found that the positive association between future orientation and employability is mediated by problem-based learning. Our moderation analyses further revealed that job market knowledge positively moderates the relationship between future orientation and problem-based learning and that students' proactive personality positively moderates the relationship between problem-based learning and perceived employability.",Future orientation; Job market knowledge; Perceived employability; Proactive personality; Problem-based learning.

18,Envisioning ecological engineering education: An international survey of the educational and professional community,"Diemont, Stewart A. W.; Lawrence, Timothy J.; Endreny, Theodore A.","Nearly half a century ago, H.T. Odum envisioned a sustainable approach to systems design where human intervention would be supplementary to nature. He referred to this concept as ecological engineering and suggested that practitioners should receive an education beyond the rigors of engineering. To understand natural processes needed to design, develop, and restore natural systems successfully, Odum suggested ecological engineers should have an expanded knowledge of environmental systems and ecology. Furthermore, he recommended broadening educational exposure to social science and liberal arts. The field of ecological engineering has blossomed in the years since Odum expressed his vision, but universities have not adopted his suggested curriculum, and undergraduate engineering students have generally seen a reduction in social science and liberal arts courses. This paper compares Odum's vision with the surveyed visions of an international group of ecological engineers, who assessed the value and characteristics of an ecological engineering undergraduate education. The respondents' perspectives vary with their location, education, and profession: however, most participants in this survey share Odum's vision, and are dissatisfied with existing curricula. Participants outside of the United States were more confident that something approaching Odum's vision for a program in ecological engineering could be delivered at the undergraduate level.

The emphasis is on reprojecting without decomposing the estimated projection matrix (P-matrix) associated with a pose. Both voxel- and ray-driven methods are considered. The voxel-driven reprojector follows the algorithm for backprojection using a P-matrix. The ray-driven reprojector is derived by extracting from the P-matrix the equation of the line joining a detector-pixel and the X-ray source position. This reprojector can be modified to a ray-driven backprojector. When the geometry is specified explicitly in terms of the physical parameters of the imaging system, the projection matrices can be constructed. The resulting ""projection-matrix method"" is advantageous, especially when the scanning trajectory is irregular. The algorithms presented are useful in iterative methods of image reconstruction and enhancement procedures, apart from their well-known role in visualization and volume rendering. Reprojections of 3-D patient data compare favorably with the original X-ray projections obtained from a prototype C-arm system.

Since breast is sensitive to x-ray radiation, dose reduction of breast CT is an important topic, and for this purpose, few-view scanning is a main approach. In this article, we propose a Deep Efficient End-to-end Reconstruction (DEER) network for few-view breast CT image reconstruction. The major merits of our network include high dose efficiency, excellent image quality, and low model complexity. By the design, the proposed network can learn the reconstruction process with as few as O(N) parameters, where N is the side length of an image to be reconstructed, which represents orders of magnitude improvements relative to the state-of-the-art deep-learning-based reconstruction methods that map raw data to tomographic images directly. Also, validated on a cone-beam breast CT dataset prepared by Koning Corporation on a commercial scanner, our method demonstrates a competitive performance over the state-of-the-art reconstruction networks in terms of image quality.

22,MSB-FCN: Multi-Scale Bidirectional FCN for Object Skeleton Extraction,"Yang, Fan; Li, Xin; Shen, Jianbing","The performance of state-of-the-art object skeleton detection (OSD) methods have been greatly boosted by Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). However, the most existing CNN-based OSD methods rely on a 'skip-layer' structure where low-level and high-level features are combined to gather multi-level contextual information. Unfortunately, as shallow features tend to be noisy and lack semantic knowledge, they will cause errors and inaccuracy. Therefore, in order to improve the accuracy of object skeleton detection, we propose a novel network architecture, the Multi-Scale Bidirectional Fully Convolutional Network (MSB-FCN), to better gather and enhance multi-scale high-level contextual information. The advantage is that only deep features are used to construct multi-scale feature representations along with a bidirectional structure for better capturing contextual knowledge. This enables the proposed MSB-FCN to learn semantic-level information from different sub-regions. Moreover, we introduce dense connections into the bidirectional structure to ensure that the learning process at each scale can directly encode information from all other scales. An attention pyramid is also integrated into our MSB-FCN to dynamically control information propagation and reduce unreliable features. Extensive experiments on various benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed MSB-FCN achieves significant improvements over the state-of-the-art algorithms.",Skeleton; Feature extraction; Image edge detection; Semantics; Task analysis; Network architecture; Benchmark testing; Salient skeleton detection; deep learning; multi-scale features

24,Domain Transformation-Based Efficient Cost Aggregation for Local Stereo Matching,"Cuong Cao Pham; Jeon, Jae Wook","Binocular stereo matching is one of the most important algorithms in the field of computer vision. Adaptive support-weight approaches, the current state-of-the-art local methods, produce results comparable to those generated by global methods. However, excessive time consumption is the main problem of these algorithms since the computational complexity is proportionally related to the support window size. In this paper, we present a novel cost aggregation method inspired by domain transformation, a recently proposed dimensionality reduction technique. This transformation enables the aggregation of 2-D cost data to be performed using a sequence of 1-D filters, which lowers computation and memory costs compared to conventional 2-D filters. Experiments show that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art local methods in terms of computational performance, since its computational complexity is independent of the input parameters. Furthermore, according to the experimental results with the Middlebury dataset and real-world images, our algorithm is currently one of the most accurate and efficient local algorithms.",Cost aggregation; domain transformation; local stereo matching
25,A Visual Sensing Concept for Robustly Classifying House Types through a Convolutional Neural Network Architecture Involving a Multi-Channel Features Extraction,"Tavakkoli, Vahid; Mohsenzadegan, Kabeh; Kyamakya, Kyandoghere","The core objective of this paper is to develop and validate a comprehensive visual sensing concept for robustly classifying house types. Previous studies regarding this type of classification show that this type of classification is not simple (i.e., tough) and most classifier models from the related literature have shown a relatively low performance. For finding a suitable model, several similar classification models based on convolutional neural network have been explored. We have found out that adding/involving/extracting better and more complex features result in a significant accuracy related performance improvement. Therefore, a new model taking this finding into consideration has been developed, tested and validated. The model developed is benchmarked with selected state-of-art classification models of relevance for the ""house classification"" endeavor. The test results obtained in this comprehensive benchmarking clearly demonstrate and validate the effectiveness and the superiority of our here developed deep-learning model. Overall, one notices that our model reaches classification performance figures (accuracy, precision, etc.) which are at least 8% higher (which is extremely significant in the ranges above 90%) than those reached by the previous state-of-the-art methods involved in the conducted comprehensive benchmarking.",classification; house architecture type classification; house type classification; convolutional neural networks
26,The Effects of Phosphate Impurity on Recovered LiNi0.6Co0.2Mn0.2O2 Cathode Material via a Hydrometallurgy Method,"Yadong Zheng,Luqman Azhari,Zifei Meng,Guanhui Gao,Yimo Han,Zhenzhen Yang,Yan Wang,Yadong Zheng,Luqman Azhari,Zifei Meng,Guanhui Gao,Yimo Han,Zhenzhen Yang,Yan Wang","From portable electronics to electric vehicles, lithium-ion batteries have been deeply integrated into our daily life and industrial fields for a few decades. The booming field of battery manufacturing could lead to shortages in resources and massive accumulation of battery waste, hindering sustainable development. Therefore, hydrometallurgy-based approaches have been widely used in industrial recycling to recover cathode materials due to their high efficiency and throughput. Impurities have always been a great challenge for hydrometallurgical recycling, introducing challenges to maintain the consistency of product quality because of potential unintended effects caused by impurities. Herein, after comprehensive investigation, we first report the impacts of phosphate impurity on a recycled LiNi0.6Co0.2Mn0.2O2 (""NCM622"") cathode via a hydrometallurgy method. We demonstrate that a passivation layer of Li3PO4 is formed at grain boundaries during sintering, which significantly raises the activation barrier and hinders lithium diffusion. In addition, the distinct degradation of cathode electrochemical properties is observed from poor particle morphology and high cation mixing as a result of phosphate impurity. Cathode powders with 1 at. % phosphate impurity retain a capacity of 146 mAh/g after 100 cycles at 0.33C, 6% less than that of a virgin cathode. Furthermore, cathodes with higher phosphate concentrations perform even worse in electrochemical tests. Therefore, phosphate impurities are detrimental to the hydrometallurgical recycling of NCM cathode materials and need to be excluded from the recycling process.",LiNi0.6Co0.2Mn0.2O2 (NCM622) cathode; electrochemistry; hydrometallurgy recycling; lithium-ion batteries; phosphate impurity.

The present study aimed to the histological, histochemical, and ultrastructural alterations induced by Au NPS in vital organs. Healthy male Wistar Albino rats (Rattus norvegicus) were subjected to 20 injections of 10-nm Au NPs at a daily dose of 2 mg/kg. Liver, kidney, heart, and lung biopsies from control and Au NPs-treated rats under study were subjected to histological and histochemical examinations. In comparison with the control rats, the renal tissue of Au NPs-treated rats demonstrated glomerular congestion, interstitial inflammatory cell infiltration, renal tubular hydropic degeneration, cloudy swelling, necrosis, and hyaline cast precipitation. In addition, Au NPs induced the following hepatic alterations: hepatocyte cytolysis, cytoplasmic vacuolation, hydropic degeneration, and nuclear alterations together with sinusoidal dilatation. Moreover, the hearts of the treated rats demonstrated myocarditis, cardiac congestion, hyalinosis, cardiomyocyte hydropic degeneration, myofiber disarray and cardiac congestion. The lungs of Au NPs-treated rats also exhibited the following pulmonary alterations: alectasis, emphysema, inflammatory cell inflammation, thickened alveolar walls, pulmonary interstitial edema, congestion, hypersensitivity, fibrocyte proliferation, and honeycombing. In conclusion, exposure to Au NPs induced histological, histochemical and ultrastructural alterations in the vital organs that may alter the function of these organs.

28,Design and implementation of environmental design based on new energy technology,"Gao, Riguan; Jiang, Junjie","In recent years, China's new energy industry has developed rapidly. The role of new energy in promoting the economy is also becoming more and more obvious. Over time, the world's energy structure will undergo earth-shaking changes. This paper aims to study how to conduct research on environmental design based on new energy technologies. This paper presents the basic concepts of new energy technology and environmental design. The experimental results of this paper show that although the energy consumption of traditional environmental art design is not increasing all the time, the general trend is rising. From about 65% at the beginning to about 90% at the end, it shows that the energy consumption generated by traditional environmental art design is very huge. This also leads to increased environmental design costs and damage to the environment. The overall energy consumption of environmental art design based on new energy technology is only between 20% and 30%. Whether it is viewed from the perspective of the sustainable development of the economy and society and the protection of the earth's ecological environment on which human beings depend, or the practical energy supply for some special purposes, the development of new energy is of great strategic significance. This shows that the new energy technology saves a lot of cost for environmental art design, and has little damage to the environment. It can be seen that it is very meaningful to apply new energy technology to environmental design.(c) 2022 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

31,A Ring Oscillator-Based PUF With Enhanced Challenge-Response Pairs,"Delavar, Mahshid; Mirzakuchaki, Sattar; Mohajeri, Javad","Physical unclonable functions (PUFs) are powerful security primitives that provide cheap and secure solutions for security-related applications. Strong PUFs provide a large set of challenge-response pairs (CRPs) and are suitable for device authentication. Weak PUFs produce a small number of CRPs and can be used for key extraction. In this paper, we propose a novel method to enhance the CRP set of traditional ring oscillatorbased PUFs (RO-PUFs). RO-PUFs are one of the most reliable types of PUFs and the best fit to implement on the field-programmable gate arrays. To the best of our knowledge, our method provides the maximum number of CRPs compared with the state of the art. In addition, the number of response bits that can be extracted by our method for each challenge is n - 1 times more than the state of the art, where n is the number of ROs. The large number of response bits results in the authentication of more devices and generation of more keys. Evaluation of the PUF responses produced by applying our method shows a significant improvement in unpredictability and randomness compared with the related works. Moreover, we show that the responses are unique and reliable.",Challenge-response pair (CRP); physical unclonable function (PUF); randomness; ring oscillator-based PUF (RO-PUF); strong PUF

In all these cases the stem was needed as a scaffold. Original humeral components were not developed for use in shoulder arthritis, so these designs and derivates had a long stem. The newest humeral implants innovations consist in shortening of the implant, or even removing the whole stem, to rely on stemless fixation at the level of the metaphysis. This implies the advantages of preserved bone stock, less stress shielding, eliminating the diaphyseal stress riser, easier implant removal at revision, and humeral component placement independent from the humeral diaphyseal axis. Nowadays, surgeons try to balance the need for a stable fixation of the humeral component with the potential need for revision surgery. Complications of revision shoulder arthroplasty are related to the need for removing a well-fixed humeral stem, the length of the procedure, and the need to treat severe bone loss.",Bone preservation; Reverse total shoulder arthroplasty; Revision surgery; Short stems; Shoulder resurfacing; Stemless shoulder replacement; Total shoulder arthroplasty.

In this work, we proposed a multimodal chemical information reconstruction system to automatically process, extract and align heterogeneous information from the text descriptions and structural images of chemical patents. Our key innovation lies in a heterogeneous data generator that produces cross-modality training data in the form of text descriptions and Markush structure images, from which a two-branch model with image- and text-processing units can then learn to both recognize heterogeneous chemical entities and simultaneously capture their correspondence. In particular, we have collected chemical structures from ChEMBL database and chemical patents from the European Patent Office and the US Patent and Trademark Office using keywords 'A61P, compound, structure' in the years from 2010 to 2020, and generated heterogeneous chemical information datasets with 210K structural images and 7818 annotated text snippets. Based on the reconstructed results and substituent replacement rules, structural libraries of a huge number of near-drug compounds can be generated automatically. In quantitative evaluations, our model can correctly reconstruct 97% of the molecular images into structured format and achieve an F1-score around 97-98% in the recognition of chemical entities, which demonstrated the effectiveness of our model in automatic information extraction from chemical patents, and hopefully transforming them to a user-friendly, structured molecular database enriching the near-drug space to realize the intelligent retrieval technology of chemical knowledge.",image recognition; multi-modal learning; name entity recognition; near-drug space.

In this study, the side effects of prostaglandin E1 in newborns with critical congenital heart disease and clinical outcomes were evaluated. Thirty-five newborns diagnosed with critical congenital heart disease were treated with prostaglandin E1 between January 2012 and September 2014 at our hospital. Patient charts were examined for prostaglandin E1 side effects (metabolic, gastric outlet obstruction, apnea), clinical status, and prognosis. Acquired data were analyzed in the SPSS 20.0 program. Patients with birth weight under 2500 g needed more days of prostaglandin E1 infusion than ones with birthweight over 2500 g (P = 0.016). The ratio of patients with birth weight under 2500 g who received prostaglandin E1 longer than 7 days was higher than the patients with birth weight over 2500 g (P = 0.02). Eighteen side effects were encountered in 11 of 35 patients (31%). Of these side effects, 1 patient had 4, 4 patients had 2, and 6 patients had only 1 side effect. Discontinuation of the therapy was never needed.

35,Estimation of nonadditive and additive genetic effects on growth traits of Horro cattle,"Habtamu Abera Goshu,Habtamu Abera Goshu","The estimation of nonadditive genetic effects plays a significant role in the accuracy of estimated breeding values for growth traits. Data for estimation of individual and maternal heterosis of crossbreed cattle in Ethiopia are limited to research institutions and universities. This paper aimed to estimate the crossbreeding effects for growth traits of Holstein Friesian × Horro and Jersey × Horro crossbreds in Ethiopia. The data included pedigree and weight data of animals born between 1980 and 2008. Heritability of growth traits was estimated using restricted maximum likelihood (ASREML). However, the additive genetic, maternal, and heterosis effects for growth traits of crossbred animals were estimated using the crossbreeding effects (CBE3) package by fitting Kinghorn's Model one. The direct and maternal heritability estimates for 1-year weight with the model that included the direct maternal covariance were 0.77 ± 0.12 and 0.26 ± 0.09, respectively. Individual heteroses estimated for Holstein Friesian × Horro and Jersey × Horro were significantly high and positive for 1-year weight (21.6 ± 6.7 and 26.0 ± 3.9 kg), preweaning average daily gain (27.4 ± 26 and 28.9 ± 15 g), and postweaning average daily gain (68.8 ± 16.6 and 61.8 ± 9.9 g), respectively. The maternal additive genetic effect for growth traits was mostly positive; therefore, it may be preferable to use crossbred cows from purebred dams instead of crossbred cows from crossbred dams. The significantly higher heterosis and additive genetic parameters in Holstein Friesian × Horro crossbreds indicated that these crossbreds may be preferable to Jersey × Horro crossbreds in areas occupied by Horro cattle.",Breeds; Growth; Heritability; Heterosis.

38,Elimination by Linear Association: An Effective and Efficient Static Mirror Adaptive Random Testing,"Omari, Michael; Chen, Jinfu; Ackah-Arthur, Hilary; Kudjo, Patrick Kwaku","Adaptive random testing (ART) is a software testing method which combines randomness with even distribution of test cases within the input domain of a program with the aim of improving the effectiveness of random testing (RT). It was established right from the onset that, ART is considerably less efficient compared to RT due to the overhead cost involved in filtering randomly generated test cases in order to achieve the even spread objective. Again, it has been observed that over-concentration on achieving better effectiveness at the expense of efficiency will make ART advantage over RT a superficial one. Besides, the ART is close to its theoretical bound in terms of effectiveness. Various algorithms have therefore emerged that seeks to minimize the efficiency deficit incurred by the ART. One of such strategies is mirror adaptive random testing (MART). Unfortunately, the MART's performance is generally unstable due to the lack of diversity in mirror generated test cases. The culprit has been identified as the mirroring functions used in place of complex ART computations. In this paper, we present elimination (E) by linear association (E-MART) as a solution to the problem of the MART that guarantees diversity in all dimension(s) of mirror test cases. By partitioning the source domain into multiple subdomains, we systematically isolate mirror partitions which are linearly associated with the source domains. The source domain is then iteratively partitioned whiles forgetting strategy is applied to select test cases. The simulations and experimental studies conducted indicate that the EMART has a more stable performance compared to the MART and compares favorably in terms of efficiency by reducing the quadratic time of the MART to linear.",Adaptive random testing; ART overhead challenge; software testing; mirror adaptive random testing
39,Maize CDKA2;1a and CDKB1;1 kinases have different requirements for their activation and participate in substrate recognition,"Mingyar N López-Hernández,Jorge M Vázquez-Ramos,Mingyar N López-Hernández,Jorge M Vázquez-Ramos","Cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs), in association with cyclins, control cell cycle progression by phosphorylating a large number of substrates. In animals, activation of CDKs regularly requires both the association with a cyclin and then phosphorylation of a highly conserved threonine residue in the CDK activation loop (the classical mechanism), mediated by a CDK-activating kinase (CAK). In addition to this typical mechanism of activation, some CDKs can also be activated by the association of a cyclin to a monomeric CDK previously phosphorylated by CAK although not all CDKs can be activated by this mechanism. In animals and yeast, cyclin, in addition to being required for CDK activation, provides substrate specificity to the cyclin/CDK complex; however, in plants both the mechanisms of CDKs activation and the relevance of the CDK-associated cyclin for substrate targeting have been poorly studied. In this work, by co-expressing proteins in E. coli, we studied maize CDKA2;1a and CDKB1;1, two of the main types of CDKs that control the cell cycle in plants. These kinases could be activated by the classical mechanism and by the association of CycD2;2a to a phosphorylated intermediate in its activation loop, a previously unproven mechanism for the activation of plant CDKs. Unlike CDKA2;1a, CDKB1;1 did not require CAK for its activation, since it autophosphorylated in its activation loop. Phosphorylation of CDKB1;1 and association of CycD2;2 was not enough for its full activation as association of maize CKS, a scaffolding protein, differentially stimulated substrate phosphorylation. Our results suggest that both CDKs participate in substrate recognition.",activation mechanism; autophosphorylation; maize CDKs; substrate recognition.

There have been no previous studies on the causative agent, Orientia tsutsugamushi, in vector mites (""chiggers"") or their small mammal hosts in Laos. Materials and Methods: Small mammals and free-living chiggers were trapped in districts of Vientiane Province and Capital. Tissues were tested for O. tsutsugamushi by PCR and serum for IgG to O. tsutsugamushi by immunofluorescence assays (IFAs). Chiggers removed from small mammals and collected in their free-living stage using black plates were identified and tested for O. tsutsugamushi by PCR. Results: Over an 18-month period, 131 small mammals of 14 species were collected in 5 districts. Seventy-eight of 131 small mammals were infested with chiggers, but all tissues were O. tsutsugamushi PCR negative. Eighteen species of chigger were identified and 1,609 were tested by PCR. A single pool of chiggers tested O. tsutsugamushi positive. Sera from 52 small mammals were tested by IFA, with 16 testing positive.

42,The Effect of Border Noise on the Performance of Projection-Based Page Segmentation Methods,"Shafait, Faisal; Breuel, Thomas M.","Projection methods have been used in the analysis of bitonal document images for different tasks such as page segmentation and skew correction for more than two decades. However, these algorithms are sensitive to the presence of border noise in document images. Border noise can appear along the page border due to scanning or photocopying. Over the years, several page segmentation algorithms have been proposed in the literature. Some of these algorithms have come into widespread use due to their high accuracy and robustness with respect to border noise. This paper addresses two important questions in this context: 1) Can existing border noise removal algorithms clean up document images to a degree required by projection methods to achieve competitive performance? 2) Can projection methods reach the performance of other state-of-the-art page segmentation algorithms (e.g., Docstrum or Voronoi) for documents where border noise has successfully been removed? We perform extensive experiments on the University of Washington (UW-III) data set with six border noise removal methods. Our results show that although projection methods can achieve the accuracy of other state-of-the-art algorithms on the cleaned document images, existing border noise removal techniques cannot clean up documents captured under a variety of scanning conditions to the degree required to achieve that accuracy.",Document page segmentation; OCR; performance evaluation; border noise removal; document cleanup
43,Multi-Perspective Representation to Part-Based Graph for Group Activity Recognition,"Wu, Lifang; Lang, Xianglong; Xiang, Ye; Wang, Qi; Tian, Meng","Group activity recognition that infers the activity of a group of people is a challenging task and has received a great deal of interest in recent years. Different from individual action recognition, group activity recognition needs to model not only the visual cues of individuals but also the relationships between them. The existing approaches inferred relations based on the holistic features of the individual. However, parts of the human body, such as the head, hands, legs, and their relationships, are the critical cues in most group activities. In this paper, we establish the part-based graphs from different viewpoints. The intra-actor part graph is designed to model the spatial relations of different parts for an individual, and the inter-actor part graph is proposed to explore part-level relations among actors, in which visual relation and location relation are both considered. Furthermore, a two-branch framework is utilized to capture the static spatial and dynamic temporal representations simultaneously. On the Volleyball Dataset, our approach obtains a classification accuracy of 94.8%, achieving very competitive performance in comparison with the state of the art. As for the Collective Activity Dataset, our approach improves the accuracy by 0.3% compared with the state-of-the-art results.",group activity recognition; part-based; graph reasoning; video analysis

The rock hyrax appears to be the least derived of the Afrotherians, a group with a huge range of body phenotypes, life histories and specialized behaviours, brain sizes, and ecological niches. In this sense, the rock hyrax represents a species where the organization of the amygdaloid complex may be reflective of that in stem Eutherian mammals. Our analysis indicates that the nuclear organization of the rock hyrax amygdaloid complex is indeed very similar to that in other mammals studied, with four major nuclear groupings (the deep or basolateral group; the superficial or cortical-like or corticomedial group; the centromedial group; and the other amygdaloid nuclei) being observed, which is typical of Eutherian mammals. Moreover, each of these groupings is composed of several nuclei, the vast majority of which were readily identified in the rock hyrax. Small nuclei identified in rodents and primates were absent in the superficial and centromedial groups, seemingly involved with olfaction. A novel shell-like nucleus of the accessory basal nuclear cluster was observed in the rock hyrax, again, likely to be involved in olfaction. The current study underlines the conserved nature of nuclear parcellation in the Eutherian mammal amygdaloid complex and indicates that across most species, the flow of information processing related to species-specific affective-laden stimuli and the resultant physiological and behavioural outcomes are likely to be similar across species.",Afrotheria; Amygdala; Behaviour; Cognition; Emotion; Mammalia.
45,Adaptive Model Update Strategy for Correlation Filter Trackers,"He, Zhuang; Li, Qi; Chang, Meng; Feng, Huajun; Xu, Zhihai","Model update is an important module in target trackers. It plays an important role in adaptive tracking. Many researches have proven that different model update strategies should be adopted, when tracking in different scenes, especially in occlusion and deformation. Though many strategies have been proposed in recent years, few of them make high improvement and good combination on trackers. In this paper, we first proved there is a close relationship between the tracking scenes and the response maps. Then, we proposed an adaptive model update strategy for calculating model update rate based on the response map. Many experiments have been done to compare the proposed model update strategy with some state-of-the-art strategies, and the results have shown that the proposed model update strategy outperforms the best model update strategy by 7 on the test of Kernel Correlation Filter tracker. Furthermore, the proposed model update strategy was evaluated on some state-of-the-art correlation filter trackers.

46,Hybrid partial-constrained learning with orthogonality regularization for unsupervised person re-identification,"Yu, Jiazuo; Peng, Jinjia; Li, Kai; Wang, Huibing","Person re-identification (re-ID) aims at determining whether there is a specific person in image sets or videos via computer vision technology. State-of-the-art unsupervised re-ID methods extract image features through CNNs-based networks and store these extracted features in memory for identity matching. However, extracted global features of these methods ignore the problem of information redundancy and the influence of the constraints between the internal features. To overcome these problems, a Hybrid Partial-constrained Learning (HPcL) network with orthogonality regularization is proposed to learn a discriminative visual representation by generating hybrid features. Specifically, the hybrid features are generated by our designed Dynamic Fusion Module (DFM) to initialize the memory dictionary and match the identity, which can constrain each part of the features extracted by our proposed Multi-Scale (M-S) module and learn robust visual representations. In addition, a new orthogonal regularization method is introduced to constrain orthogonality of the kernel weights and features, which reduces the correlations among features.

Using a laboratory furnace, the ignition and combustion characteristics of fuels as well as NOx and SOx emissions were determined. Using multiple-criteria decision-making (MCDM) methods and experimental results, we access the performance of four different slurry fuels in comparison with bituminous coal. The novelty of the study is based on the following features: we consider a unique set of parameters of the fuels (economic, environmental, safety and energy indicators), as well as three countries for their potential use (the USA, India and Russia); three different methods for calculating the efficiency indicator of each fuel were used. Despite rather low energy performance, the summarizing efficiency indicator of waste-based slurries was 53-93% higher than that of coal. The use of cardboard in the composition of a fuel blend showed the best complex result (the increase in the efficiency indicator was 80-93% relative to coal). The least promising additive was the pyrolysis residue of automobile tires. Its addition resulted in a 10-15% decrease in overall efficiency relative to a slurry without additives. The research results are useful for optimizing the component composition of waste-based slurries, technical and economic development of projects for the incineration of various wastes in the form of high-moisture fuel slurries.",Coal slime; combustion; fuel efficiency; multiple-criteria decision-making; municipal solid waste; slurry.
48,Edge-Aware Convolution Neural Network Based Salient Object Detection,"Guan, Wenlong; Wang, Tiantian; Qi, Jinqing; Zhang, Lihe; Lu, Huchuan","Salient object detection has received great amount of attention in recent years. In this letter, we propose a novel salient object detection algorithm, which combines the global contextual information along with the low-level edge features. First, we train an edge detection stream based on the state-of-the-art holistically-nested edge detection (HED) model and extract hierarchical boundary information from each VGG block. Then, the edge contours are served as the complementary edge-aware information and integrated with the saliency detection stream to depict continuous boundary for salient objects. Finally, we combine pyramid pooling modules with auxiliary side output supervision to form the multi-scale pyramid-based supervision module, providing multi-scale global contextual information for the saliency detection network. Compared with the previous methods, the proposed network contains more explicit edge-aware features and exploit the multi-scale global information more effectively. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, which achieves the state-of-the-art performance on five popular benchmarks.",Saliency detection; edge detection; pyramid pooling network; convolutional neural networks (CNNs)

50,LncRNA XR_351665 Contributes to Chronic Pain-Induced Depression by Upregulating DNMT1 via Sponging miR-152-3p,"Xiaobao Ding,Yuwen Lin,Binbin Yan,Xiaowei Jiao,Qiang Liu,Huihui Miao,Yuqing Wu,Chenghua Zhou,Xiaobao Ding,Yuwen Lin,Binbin Yan,Xiaowei Jiao,Qiang Liu,Huihui Miao,Yuqing Wu,Chenghua Zhou","Chronic pain is frequently comorbid with depression. However, the mechanisms underlying chronic pain-induced depression remain unclear. Here, we found that DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) was upregulated in the central amygdala (CeA) of spared nerve injury (SNI)-induced chronic pain-depression rats, and knockdown of DNMT1 could improve the depression-like behaviors in SNI rats. Additionally, a panel of differentially expressed lncRNAs, including 38 upregulated and 12 downregulated lncRNAs, were identified by microarray analysis. Bioinformatics analysis suggested that the upregulated lncRNA XR_351665 was the upstream molecule to regulate DNMT1 expression. The knockdown of XR_351665 significantly alleviated the depression-like behaviors in SNI rats, whereas overexpression of XR_351665 induced the depression-like behaviors in naïve rats. Further mechanism-related researches uncovered that XR_351665 functioned as a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) to upregulate DNMT1 by competitively sponging miR-152-3p, and subsequently promoted the development of chronic pain-induced depression. Our findings suggest that lncRNA XR_351665 is involved in the development of chronic pain-induced depression by upregulating DNMT1 via sponging miR-152-3p. These data provide novel insight into understanding the pathogenesis of chronic pain-induced depression and identify a potential therapeutic target. PERSPECTIVE: LncRNA XR_351665 in CeA functions as a ceRNA to block the inhibitory effect of miR-152-3p on DNMT1 and contributes to the development of chronic pain-induced depression. These data suggest that manipulation of XR_351665/miR-152-3p/DNMT1 axis may be a potential method to attenuate chronic pain-induced depression.",DNMT1; Depression; Pain; lncRNA XR_351665; miR-152-3p.

Considering the major medical and veterinary importance of this parasite, the phylogeny of the genus Echinococcus is of considerable importance; yet, despite numerous efforts with both mitochondrial and nuclear data, it has remained unresolved. The genus is clearly complex, and this is one of the reasons for the incomplete understanding of its taxonomy. Although taxonomic studies have recognised E. multilocularis as a separate entity from the Echinococcus granulosus complex and other members of the genus, it would be premature to draw firm conclusions about the taxonomy of the genus before the phylogeny of the whole genus is fully resolved. The recent sequencing of E. multilocularis and E. granulosus genomes opens new possibilities for performing in-depth phylogenetic analyses. In addition, whole genome data provide the possibility of inferring phylogenies based on a large number of functional genes, i.e. genes that trace the evolutionary history of adaptation in E. multilocularis and other members of the genus. Moreover, genomic data open new avenues for studying the molecular epidemiology of E. multilocularis: genotyping studies with larger panels of genetic markers allow the genetic diversity and spatial dynamics of parasites to be evaluated with greater precision. There is an urgent need for international coordination of genotyping of E. multilocularis isolates from animals and human patients. This could be fundamental for a better understanding of the transmission of alveolar echinococcosis and for designing efficient healthcare strategies.",Echinococcus multilocularis; Molecular phylogeny; Parasite adaptation strategies; Taxonomy.

A community-based education intervention was designed to mobilize fathers' support for early breastfeeding. This study aimed to evaluate an education intervention targeting fathers to increase the proportion of early breastfeeding initiation and to reduce prelacteal feeding. Quasi-experimental study design was used to compare intervention and control areas located in two non-adjacent rural districts that shared similar demographic and health service characteristics in northern Viet Nam. Fathers and expectant fathers with pregnant wives from 7 to 30 weeks gestational age were recruited. Fathers in the intervention area received breastfeeding education materials, counselling services at a commune health centre and household visits. They were also invited to participate in a breastfeeding promotion social event. After intervention, early breastfeeding initiation rate was 81.2% in the intervention area and 39.6% in the control area (P < 0.001). Babies in the intervention area were more likely to be breastfed within the first hour after birth [odds ratio (OR) 7.64, 95% confidence interval (CI) 4.81-12.12] and not to receive any prelacteal feeding (OR 4.43, 95% CI 2.88-6.82) compared with those in the control area.

Atopic dermatitis is a common, chronic, pruritic, and inflammatory skin disease. It can have a profound, negative effect on patients' quality of life. Mild cases of atopic dermatitis can be controlled by the application of moisturizers and topical corticosteroids. However, in severe cases, application of immunosuppressive medication is unavoidable but it can have adverse effects. In traditional Persian medicine, diseases similar to resistant atopic dermatitis are treated with whey in combination with decoction of field dodder. Both whey and field dodder have anti-inflammatory properties. Consumption of whey can also aid skin repair, mitigate pruritus, and help combat the high level of stress experienced by patients. Therefore, it is hypothesized that consumption of traditional medicinal treatment of whey with decoction of field dodder can be applied as a complementary treatment for atopic dermatitis.",atopic dermatitis; field dodder; traditional medicine; whey.

This study compares the use of the commercially available Platelia Total Ab Assay (Bio-Rad) nucleocapsid ELISA to the widely used Mount Sinai spike IgG ELISA in a Kenyan population seroprevalence study. Using longitudinal plasma specimens collected from a mother-infant cohort living in Nairobi, Kenya between May 2019 and December 2020, this study demonstrates that the two assays have a high qualitative agreement (92.7%) and strong correlation of antibody levels (R2 = 0.973) in repeated measures. Within this cohort, seroprevalence detected by either ELISA closely resembled previously published seroprevalence estimates for Kenya during the sampling period and no significant difference in the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 antibody detection by either assay was observed. Assay comparability was not affected by HIV exposure status. These data support the use of the Platelia SARS-CoV-2 Total Ab ELISA as a suitable high-throughput method for seroprevalence studies in Kenya.",ELISA; Kenya; SARS-CoV-2; nucleocapsid; serology; spike.
56,Gradient-Based Illumination Description for Image Forgery Detection,"Matern, Falko; Riess, Christian; Stamminger, Marc","The goal of blind image forensics is to determine authenticity and origin of an image without using an explicitly embedded security scheme. Most existing forensic methods can roughly be grouped into statistical and physics-based approaches. Statistical methods can oftentimes be fully automated, and achieve impressive results on current state-of-the-art benchmarks. Physics-based methods explain image inconsistencies using an analytic model, and are more robust to common image processing operations such as resizing or recompression. In this work, we propose a physics-based forensic descriptor to characterize 2-D lighting environments of objects. The key idea is that the integral over a gradient field of an object indicates the direction of incident light in the image plane. In contrast to prior 2-D lighting methods, the proposed method is remarkably robust to changes in object color and variations in user input, as it operates on the whole object area instead of object contours. Furthermore, we show that the proposed method is unaffected by image resizing or compression, which makes it possible to analyze images that are impossible to analyze with current state-of-the-art statistical methods.",Lighting; Computational modeling; Solid modeling; Geometry; Light sources; Image forensics; Image forensics; lighting direction; image gradient; physics-based methods; manipulation detection

W.; Borneman, Z.; Nijmeijer, K.","Electrodialysis (ED) is currently used for selective removal of ions and brackish water desalination, while for seawater desalination ED is considered to be too energy intensive. This research focuses on the viability of ED using multiple stages for seawater desalination. With staging, the driving force is adapted to the governing conditions at that specific stage, operating at its individual optimum at lower energy consumption. An ED multistage configuration is examined that contains up to four stages. We compare single stage with multistage ED and investigate the effect of operation parameters. Different current densities are applied and optimized and residence time is compared to describe both transmembrane salt and water fluxes. We showed that desalination from 500 mM to 200 mM is possible, but that for these desalination conditions a multistage and single-stage system perform equal. Operation of each stage of the multistage close to limiting current density shows that desalination of synthetic seawater close to drinking water quality is possible. To reach this, the energy consumption is 3.6 kWh/m3 and at least 4 stages are needed. Although outlet concentrations between ED and RO are different, this non-optimized ED system showed double the energy consumption of the state-of-the-art desalination technology RO.",Electrodialysis; Multistage; Seawater desalination; Energy consumption; Water transport
58,SWIN transformer based contrastive self-supervised learning for animal detection and classification,"Agilandeeswari, L.; Meena, S. Divya","The subdomain of computer vision applications is Image Classification which helps in categorizing the images. The advent of handheld devices and image sensors leads to the availability of a huge amount of data without labels. Hence, to categorize these images, a supervised learning algorithm won't be suitable as it requires labels. On the other hand, unsupervised learning uses clustering that also not useful as its accuracy is not reliable as the data are not labeled in advance. Self-Supervised Learning techniques can be used to overcome this problem. In this work, we present a novel Swin Transformer based Contrastive Self-Supervised Learning (Swin-TCSSL), where the paired sample is formed using the transformation of the given input image and this paired sample is passed to the Swin-T transformer which produces a feature vector. The maximum Mutual Information of these feature vectors is used to form robust clusters and these cluster labels get propagates to the Swin Transformer block until the appropriate clusters are obtained. It is then followed by contrastive learning and finally produces the classified output. The experimental results prove that the proposed system is invariant to occlusion, viewpoint variation, and illumination effects. The proposed Swin-TSSCL achieves state-of-the-art results in 5 benchmark datasets namely CIFAR-10, Snapshot Serengeti, Stanford dogs, Animals with attributes, and ImageNet dataset. As evident from the rigorous experiments, the proposed Swin-TCSSL has set a new global state-of-the-art with an average accuracy of 97.63%, which is comparatively higher than the state-of-the-art systems.",Image classification; Swin transformer; Contrastive self-supervised learning; Clustering; And mutual information

It is mianly caused by some inevitable circumstances, e.g., the document defacement, statistical difficulty in remote districts, and inaccurate information cleaning, etc. Those missing entries which make valuable information invisible may distort the further urban analysis. To improve the quality of missing data imputation, we propose an improved spatial multi-kernel learning method to guide the imputation process incorporating with the adaptive-weight non-negative matrix factorization strategy. Our model takes into account the regional latent similarities and the real geographical positions as well as the correlations among various views that are able to complete missing values precisely. We conduct intensive experiments to evaluate our method and compare with other state-of-the-art approaches on real-world datasets. All the empirical results show that the proposed model outperforms all the other state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, our model represents a strong generalization ability across multiple cities.",Missing data imputation; spatial data; statistic data; multi-view
60,Adopting the YOLOv4 Architecture for Low-Latency Multispectral Pedestrian Detection in Autonomous Driving,"Roszyk, Kamil; Nowicki, Michal R.; Skrzypczynski, Piotr","Detecting pedestrians in autonomous driving is a safety-critical task, and the decision to avoid a a person has to be made with minimal latency. Multispectral approaches that combine RGB and thermal images are researched extensively, as they make it possible to gain robustness under varying illumination and weather conditions. State-of-the-art solutions employing deep neural networks offer high accuracy of pedestrian detection. However, the literature is short of works that evaluate multispectral pedestrian detection with respect to its feasibility in obstacle avoidance scenarios, taking into account the motion of the vehicle. Therefore, we investigated the real-time neural network detector architecture You Only Look Once, the latest version (YOLOv4), and demonstrate that this detector can be adapted to multispectral pedestrian detection. It can achieve accuracy on par with the state-of-the-art while being highly computationally efficient, thereby supporting low-latency decision making. The results achieved on the KAIST dataset were evaluated from the perspective of automotive applications, where low latency and a low number of false negatives are critical parameters.

T.; Cavalieri, Daniel C.","This work aims to propose an approach for detecting novelties, taking into account the temporal flow of data streams in social media. To this end, we present a completely new architecture for novelty detection. This new architecture entails three new contributions. First, we propose a new concept for novelty definition based on temporal windows. Second, we formulate an expression to determine the quality of a novelty. Third, we introduce a new approach to the fusion of heterogeneous data (image + text), using the COCO dataset and the MASK-RCNN convolutional neural network, which transforms image and text from social media into a single data format ready to be identified by machine learning algorithms. Since novelty detection is a task in which labeled samples are scarce or inexistent, unsupervised algorithms are used, and thus, the following baseline and state-of-the-art algorithms have been chosen: kNN, HBOS, FBagging, IForesting, and autoencoders. The new fusion approach is also compared to a state-of-the-art approach to outlier detection named AOM. Because of temporal particularities and the data types being fused, a new dataset was created, containing 27,494 tweets collected from Twitter.

Permutation invariant training (PIT) is a state of the art model-based approach, which applies a single neural network to solve this single-input, multiple-output modeling problem. We propose to advance the current state of the art by imposing a modular structure on the neural network, applying a progressive pretraining regimen, and improving the objective function with transfer learning and a discriminative training criterion. The modular structure splits the problem into three subtasks: frame-wise interpreting, utterance-level speaker tracing, and speech recognition. The pretraining regimen uses these modules to solve progressively harder tasks. Transfer learning leverages parallel clean speech to improve the training targets for the network. Our discriminative training formulation is a modification of standard formulations that also penalizes competing outputs of the system. Experiments are conducted on the artificial overlapped switchboard and hub5e-swb dataset. The proposed framework achieves over 30% relative improvement of word error rate over both a strong jointly trained system, PIT for ASR, and a separately optimized system, PIT for speech separation with clean speech ASR model. The improvement comes from better model generalization, training efficiency, and the sequence level linguistic knowledge integration.",Unsupervised single channel overlapped speech recognition; permutation invariant training; progressive joint training; transfer learning; sequence discriminative training

Although PD dopaminergic medication (L-DOPA) seems to generally reduce FOG severity, its effect on neural mechanisms of FOG remains to be determined. The purpose of this study was to quantify the effect of L-DOPA on brain resting-state functional connectivity in individuals with FOG. Functional magnetic resonance imaging was acquired at rest in 30 individuals living with PD (15 freezers) in the ON- and OFF- medication state. A seed-to-voxel analysis was performed with seeds in the bilateral basal ganglia nuclei, the thalamus and the mesencephalic locomotor region. In freezers, medication-state contrasts revealed numerous changes in resting-state functional connectivity, not modulated by L-DOPA in non-freezers. In freezers, L-DOPA increased the functional connectivity between the seeds and regions including the posterior parietal, the posterior cingulate, the motor and the medial prefrontal cortices. Comparisons with non-freezers revealed that L-DOPA generally normalizes brain functional connectivity to non-freezers levels but can also increase functional connectivity, possibly compensating for dysfunctional networks in freezers. Our findings suggest that L-DOPA could contribute to a better sensorimotor, attentional, response inhibition and limbic processing to prevent FOG when triggers are encountered but could also contribute to FOG by interfering with the processing capacity of the striatum. This study shows that levodopa taken to control PD symptoms induces changes in functional connectivity at rest, in freezers only. Increases (green) in functional connectivity of GPe, GPi, putamen and thalamus with cognitive, sensorimotor and limbic cortical regions of the Interference model (blue) was observed. Our results suggest that levodopa can normalize connections similar to non-freezers or increases connectivity to compensate for dysfunctional networks.",Parkinson's disease; freezing of gait; levodopa; resting-state functional connectivity.
66,Jointly Extract Entities and Their Relations From Biomedical Text,"Chen, Jizhi; Gu, Junzhong","Entity recognition and relation extraction have become an important part of knowledge acquisition, and which have been widely applied in various fields, such as Bioinformatics. However, prior state-of-the-art extraction models heavily rely on the external features obtained from hand-craft or natural language processing (NLP) tools. As a result, the performance of models depends directly on the accuracy of the obtained features. Moreover, current joint extraction approaches cannot effectively tackle the multi-head problem (i.e. an entity is related to multiple entities). In this paper, we firstly present a novel tagging scheme and then propose a joint approach based deep neural network for producing unique tagging sequences. Our approach can not only simultaneously perform entity resolution and relation extraction without any external features, but also effectively solve the multi-head problem. Besides, since arbitrary tokens may provide important cues for two components, we exploit self-attention to explicitly capture long-range dependencies among them and character embeddings to learn the features of lexical morphology, which make our method less susceptible to cascading errors. The results demonstrate that the joint method proposed outperforms the other state-of-the-art joint models.

We aimed to analyze the prognostic value of the Naples Prognostic Score in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients following surgery. Methods: A total of 319 NSCLCpatients following surgery were analyzed in the retrospective cohort study. We analyzed the predictive value of Naples Prognostic Score for overall survival and recurrence-free survival in postoperative non-small cell lung cancer patients by using Kaplan-Meier survival curves and multivariate Cox regression analysis. At the same time, the time-dependent ROC and the area under curves were also created to compare the accuracy of different scoring systems. Results: According to NPS, we divided all patients into 3 groups，120 patients were divided into group 0, 161 patients were divided into group 1, and 38 patients were divided into group 2. The median survival time for all patients is 32 months, and the median survival times for different groups were 35 months, 31 months, and 28 months, respectively. The overall survival and recurrence-free survival survival curves of different groups were significantly different (both P < .05), and patients in the higher NPS groups had a disappointing prognosis. NPS may be an independent prognostic factor for overall survival and recurrence-free survival, according to the results of multivariate analysis (both P < .05). The area under curve showed that the accuracy of the NPS was significantly better than other score systems. Conclusions: The NPS is closely related to the long-term survival prognosis of patients with NSCLC, especially in stage III patients.",Naples Prognostic Score; inflammation; nutrition; predictive; stage III NSCLC.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an opportunistic pathogen which is exposed to different cell wall stresses imposed by exposure to antibiotics, osmotic pressure, and long-time colonization of host tissues such as the lung in cystic fibrosis patients. In response to these stresses, P. aeruginosa is able to respond by establishing a cell envelope stress response involving different regulatory pathways including the extra-cytoplasmic sigma factors AlgU, SigX, and SbrI and other two-component sensor/response regulators and effectors. This chapter aims to review the different factors leading to the activation of the cell envelope stress response in P. aeruginosa and the genetic determinants involved in this response, which is crucial for the survival of the bacterium upon exposure to different stressful conditions.",Cell envelope stress; Mechanosensitive channels; Sigma factors; Two-component systems.

In this study, the long-term datasets of aerosols, meteorological parameters, and enhanced vegetation index (EVI) were used from September 2002 to December 2021 over Turkey. This study examined the spatiotemporal distribution of aerosols and their association with meteorological parameters (temperature (Temp), relative humidity (RH), wind speed (WS)), and EVI over Turkey from 2002 to 2021. Moreover, this study also performed a comparison of AOD retrieved from Aqua with other satellites (Terra, SeaWiFS, and MISR) and ground-based (AERONET) products. The higher mean seasonal AOD (> 0.3) was observed over Southeastern Anatolia Region due to the dust transport from the Saharan Desert and Arabian Peninsula. Moreover, AOD was positively correlated with Temp and WS in the east of Turkey, while negative correlations were observed in the coastal regions. The correlation between AOD and RH was also observed negative in most parts of Turkey. Furthermore, in the coastal region, the correlation between AOD and EVI was found to be positive, whereas a negative correlation was seen over less vegetative areas. The multi-seasonal AOD averages were calculated as 0.187, 0.183, 0.138, and 0.104 for the spring, summer, autumn, and winter seasons, respectively. The most important result of this study is the regional differences in AOD over Turkey. For new studies, AOD should be observed separately for coastal areas and the eastern part of Turkey.",Aerosol optical depth; Aqua-MODIS; Enhanced vegetation index; Meteorological parameters; Turkey.
72,Roof Classification From 3-D LiDAR Point Clouds Using Multiview CNN With Self-Attention,"Shajahan, Dimple A.; Nayel, Vaibhav; Muthuganapathy, Ramanathan","Classification of light detection and ranging (LiDAR) point clouds of building roofs plays a vital role in various urban management applications and is significant in geographic information systems (GISs) and remote sensing. In this letter, a novel deep learning-based method is proposed for classifying roof point clouds, which outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. We use a view-based method called a multiview convolutional neural network with self-attention (MVCNN-SA), which takes the multiple views of a roof point cloud as input and outputs the category of the roof. Current view-based approaches treat all views equally and simply combine the view features into a single compact 3-D descriptor. Our adaptive weight-learning algorithm, which uses the SA block, discovers the relative importance of each view, thus assigning relative weights to the views. This enhances the shape descriptor, resulting in better classification performance. The effectiveness of the proposed method is then verified on the publicly available data set-RoofN3D-by comparing it with the current state-of-the-art methods.",Three-dimensional displays; Laser radar; Feature extraction; Shape; Solid modeling; Deep learning; Cameras; Airborne laser scan (ALS); light detection and ranging (LiDAR); multiview convolutional neural network with self-attention (MVCNN-SA); point clouds; roof classification; self-attention
73,Toward energy-efficient online Complete Coverage Path Planning of a ship hull maintenance robot based on Glasius Bio-inspired Neural Network,"Muthugala, M. A. Viraj J.; Samarakoon, S. M. Bhagya P.; Elara, Mohan Rajesh","Regular Ship hull maintenance is an essential for sustainability. The maintenance work of ship hulls that involve human labor suffers from many shortcomings. Maintenance robots have been introduced for drydocks to eliminate these shortcomings. An energy-efficient Complete Coverage Path Planning (CCPP) is a crucial requirement from a ship hull maintenance robot. This paper proposes a novel energy-efficient CCPP method based on Glasius Bioinspired Neural Network (GBNN) for a ship hull inspection robot. The proposed method accounts for a comprehensive energy model for path planning. This energy model reflects the energy usage of a ship hull maintenance robot due to changes in direction, distance, and vertical position. Furthermore, the proposed method is effective for dynamic workspaces since it performs online path planning. These are the major contributions made to state of the art by the work proposed in this paper. The behavior and the performance of the proposed method have been compared against state of the art through simulations considering Hornbill, a multipurpose ship hull maintenance robot. The validation confirms the ability of the proposed in realizing a complete coverage of a given dynamic workspace. According to the statistical outcomes of the comparison, the performance of the proposed method significantly surpasses that of the state-of-the-art methods in terms of energy usage. Therefore, the proposed method contributes to the development of energy-efficient CCPP methods for a ship hull maintenance robot.",Complete area coverage; Energy efficiency; Glasius Bio-inspired Neural Network; Maintenance robotics; Ship maintenance

Furthermore, these patients are usually older than 60 years and have comorbidities. For all these reasons they are highly vulnerable to infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) and have an increased risk of developing severe/critical Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) compared to the general population. Although COVID-19 vaccination has proven effective in reducing the incidence of severe/critical disease, vaccinated patients with lymphoma may not be protected as they often fail to develop a sufficient antiviral immune response. There is therefore an urgent need to address the management of patients with lymphoma and COVID-19 in the setting of the ongoing pandemic. Passive immunization with monoclonal antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 is a currently available complementary drug strategy to active vaccination for lymphoma patients, while monoclonal antibodies and antiviral drugs (remdesivir, ritonavir-boosted nirmatrelvir, and molnupiravir) have proven effective in preventing the progression to severe/critical COVID-19. In this narrative review we present the most recent data documenting the characteristics and outcomes of patients with concomitant lymphoma and COVID-19. Our ultimate goal is to provide practice-oriented guidance in the management of these vulnerable patients from diagnosis to treatment and follow-up of lymphoma. To this purpose, we will first provide an overview of the main data concerning prognostic factors and fatality rate of lymphoma patients who develop COVID-19; the outcomes of COVID-19 vaccination will also be addressed. We will then discuss current COVID-19 prophylaxis and treatment options for lymphoma patients. Finally, based on the literature and our multidisciplinary experience, we will summarize a set of indications on how to manage patients with lymphoma according to COVID-19 exposure, level of disease severity and former history of infection, as typically encountered in clinical practice.",COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2; antiviral; immunosuppression; lymphoma; monoclonal antibody.

Methods In-depth interviews with 20 PLHA were conducted in March 1999. Participants were recruited from the USAID-funded Longitudinal Enhanced Evaluation of ART Project, which tracks a cohort of eligible PLHA receiving treatment at five collaborating treatment centers in Guangxi Autonomous Region, China. An interview guide (semi-structured with open-ended questions) was developed to provide a qualitative examination of the quality of life of PLHA. Results Participants identified that ART affects physical health, including the experience of pain, side effects, and opportunistic infections. ART imposes lifestyle constraints such as reduced mobility due to drug procurement, and social restrictions due to the daily drug regimen. Participants discussed the psychological burden of taking drugs, and the fear of accidental transmission to others, or having their disease status known by others, as well as optimistic feelings about their future due to ART. ART poses a significant drain on individual's economic resources due to related medical costs, and inability to seek seasonal migrant labor due to reduced mobility. Conclusion While China's national free ART program improved the physical health of those surveyed, their social and economic needs were left unaddressed. To improve life outcomes for PLHA, and by extension, the wider Chinese population, quality of life measures should be included when evaluating the success of the ART program.",HIV/AIDS; ART; Quality of life; Qualitative study; China
76,CCLS: An Efficient Local Search Algorithm for Weighted Maximum Satisfiability,"Luo, Chuan; Cai, Shaowei; Wu, Wei; Jie, Zhong; Su, Kaile","The maximum satisfiability (MAX-SAT) problem, especially the weighted version, has extensive applications. Weighted MAX-SAT instances encoded from real-world applications may be very large, which calls for efficient approximate methods, mainly stochastic local search (SLS) ones. However, few works exist on SLS algorithms for weighted MAX-SAT. In this paper, we propose a new heuristic called CCM for weighted MAX-SAT. The CCM heuristic prefers to select a CCMP variable. By combining CCM with random walk, we design a simple SLS algorithm dubbed CCLS for weighted MAX-SAT. The CCLS algorithm is evaluated against a state-of-the-art SLS solver IRoTS and two state-of-the-art complete solvers namely akmaxsat_ls and New WPM2, on a broad range of weighted MAX-SAT instances. Experimental results illustrate that the quality of solution found by CCLS is much better than that found by IRoTS, akmaxsat_ls and New WPM2 on most industrial, crafted and random instances, indicating the efficiency and the robustness of the CCLS algorithm. Furthermore, CCLS is evaluated in the weighted and unweighted MAX-SAT tracks of incomplete solvers in the Eighth Max-SAT Evaluation (Max-SAT 2013), and wins four tracks in this evaluation, illustrating that the performance of CCLS exceeds the current state-of-the-art performance of SLS algorithms on solving MAX-SAT instances.",Local search; weighted; maximum satisfiability; configuration checking; make

78,Cost-Effective Features for Reidentification in Camera Networks,"Tahir, Syed Fahad; Cavallaro, Andrea",Networks of smart cameras share large amounts of data to accomplish tasks such as reidentification. We propose a feature-selection method that minimizes the data needed to represent the appearance of objects by learning the most appropriate feature set for the task at hand (person reidentification). The computational cost for feature extraction and the cost for storing the feature descriptor are considered jointly with feature performance to select cost-effective good features. This selection allows us to improve intercamera reidentification while reducing the bandwidth that is necessary to share data across the camera network. We also rank the selected features in the order of effectiveness for the task to enable a further reduction of the feature set by dropping the least effective features when application constraints require this adaptation. We compare the proposed approach with state-of-the-art methods on the iLIDS and VIPeR datasets and show that the proposed approach considerably reduces network traffic due to intercamera feature sharing while keeping the reidentification performance at an equivalent or better level compared with the state of the art.,Cost of features; data reduction; feature selection; person reidentification; smart camera networks

Metastases to the NU/DP may be the initial presenting sign of a new or recurrent malignancy. Since the most recent systematic review of case reports (133 patients total) was conducted in 2001, we conducted a systematic review from 1900 to 2021 (244 patients total) to assess any changes in trends in demographics, clinical presentation, and morphology and to report on more updated differential diagnoses. We also examined cases for age, sex, race, ethnicity, Fitzpatrick skin type, laterality, distribution, and diagnostic methods. The PubMed database (1900-2021) was used to detect case-level data per Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. We found that the most common primary tumors were lung, kidney, and esophagus. A NU/DP metastasis was the presenting sign of malignancy in 31.00% of patients without a former cancer diagnosis. Male to female ratio was 2:1, with average age at diagnosis 58 years. Metastases most often affected a single digit (79.91%), particularly the thumb, followed by the fourth digit. This systematic review corroborates that metastases to the NU/DP may be the initial presenting sign of a new or recurrent malignancy and provides updated diagnostic guidelines. NU/DP metastasis should be considered in both healthy patients and patients with a former malignancy diagnosis presenting with nail changes involving a single digit. Prompt diagnosis and treatment may improve prognosis.",Cancer; Distal phalanx; Metastasis; Nail.

However, the other benefits of MFC-CWs are seldom reported, especially the potential for controlling gaseous emissions. In this study, we have quantitatively compared the pollutant removal efficiency and the emission of multiple gases between MFC-CWs and batch-fed wetland systems (BF CWs). MFC-CWs exhibited significantly (p < 0.01) higher COD, NH4+-N, TN, and TP removal efficiencies and significantly (p < 0.01) lower global warming potential (GWP) than BF CWs. The integration of MFC decreased GWP by 23.88% due to the reduction of CH4 and N2O fluxes, whereas the CO2 fluxes were slightly promoted. The quantitative PCR results indicate that the reduced N2O fluxes in MFC-CWs were driven by the reduced transcription of the nosZ gene and enhanced the ratio of nosZ/(nirS + nirK); the reduced CH4 fluxes were related to pomA and mcrA. Additionally, the NH3 fluxes were reduced by 52.20% in MFC-CWs compared to BF CWs. The integration of MFC promoted the diversity of microbial community, especially Anaerolineaceae, Saprospiraceae and Clostridiacea. This study highlights a further benefit of MFC-CWs and provides a new strategy for simultaneously removing pollutants and abating multiple gas emissions in BF CWs.",Ammonia volatilization; Constructed wetlands; Greenhouse gas emission; Microbial fuel cells.

Nevertheless, until now, the different approaches have been based on subjective assessments, due to computational limitations for a more objective methodology. Nowadays, cutting-edge technologies such as GIS allow us to address spatial studies in caves and overcome their geomorphologically complex and closed characteristics. Here we describe an innovative methodology that uses computing tools available to any researcher to study the viewsheds of the graphic units in decorated caves. We have tested its validity on the recently discovered rock art ensemble of Atxurra Cave, in Northern Spain. We demonstrate that this technology (GIS), widely used in other fields of archaeology, especially in outdoor studies, is also useable in caverns, taking into account the complex morphologies -ceilings and diverse floor-levels, for example. These programmes have also allowed us to consider the lighting systems used by the prehistoric groups inside the cave, as well as various data previously estimated by other authors, such as the height of individuals during the European LUP. The dynamism of these tools -2.5D-, as well as the advancement of new 3D GIS technologies, will allow in the future remarkable progress in these types of structural studies for a better understanding of Palaeolithic cave art phenomena.",Cave art; Viewshed; Archaeological context; Cave geomorphology; GIS; Palaeolithic
82,Early Diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorder: What the Pediatricians Should Know,"Pratibha Singhi,Prahbhjot Malhi,Pratibha Singhi,Prahbhjot Malhi","Autism is a spectrum disorder marked by considerable heterogeneity and characterized by impairments in the social communication domain along with the presence of restricted and repetitive behaviors or interests. Comprehensive autism evaluation generally consists of assessments by a multidisciplinary team. Having multiple specialists in the evaluation team aids in diagnosis and in chalking out a comprehensive management plan. Diagnosis is generally based on detailed developmental history, clinical judgment, and the use of standardized diagnostic instruments. Differential diagnosis is complicated as many of the mental health and neurodevelopmental conditions that routinely coexist with autism also have some symptoms that overlap with autism. Several barriers are linked to delay in diagnosis including lack of comfort in diagnosing autism by primary care providers, delayed referrals, the inability of parents to raise critical developmental concerns, confusion of autism with other conditions, and health system that is not responsive to the needs of the underserved communities. The etiology of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is complex and still not completely understood; it involves genetics, neurobiology, and environmental exposures, leading to a diverse presentation of behaviors and symptoms. There is an imperative need to start therapeutic interventions as soon as a diagnosis of autism is suspected rather than wait for a definitive diagnosis. Early diagnosis is vital as timely intervention can lead to better outcomes for children and their families.",Autism spectrum disorders; Diagnosis; Early identification; Screening.
83,Exploring Advertising Effectiveness of Tourist Hotels' Marketing Images Containing Nature and Performing Arts: An Eye-Tracking Analysis,"Wang, Tsai Chiao; Tsai, Chia Liang; Tang, Ta Wei","The beautiful, natural environment in a tourist hotel's marketing images can evoke relaxing and soothing emotions. However, can tourist hotels use nature as a servicescape to make their performing arts services more attractive? Based on attention restoration and servicescape theory, this study explores and compares the influence of tourist hotels' performing arts images with nature- or built-based servicescapes on the advertising effectiveness (i.e., customer visual attention and behavioral intention). To analyze visual attention on the marketing images, this study uses eye-tracking technology to record customer visual trajectories. This experiment used a total of 113 participants. The sample size of the nature-based servicescape group was 59 (age with mean = 39.04), and that of the built-based servicescape group was 54 (age with mean = 40.17). A tourist hotel's (Volando Urai Spring Spa & Resort) marketing images were chosen as stimuli. All participants were randomly assigned to the nature-based or the built-based servicescape group. In each experimental group, all the images were randomly presented to reduce any order effects of the images. By using eye-tracking analysis, the experimental findings were as follows: (1) A nature-based servicescape can arouse more visual attention of customers than a built-based servicescape can; (2) Marketing images with performing arts activities in nature-based servicescapes attract the visual attention of customers; (3) Nature-based servicescapes stimulate higher behavioral intentions of consumers than built-based servicescape.",visual attention; eye-tracking; attention restoration theory; nature-based servicescape; behavioral intention

Isotopically enriched ENMs may be distinguished from NNMs with the same elemental composition using single-particle inductively coupled plasma time-of-flight mass spectrometry (spICP-TOF-MS) to measure multiple isotopes simultaneously within each ENM and NNM in soil, but the minimum isotope enrichment needed for detection of ENMs in soil is not known. Here, we determined the isotope enrichment needed for 47Ti-enriched TiO2 ENMs to be detectable in soil and assessed the effects of weathering on those requirements for less soluble TiO2 and more soluble CuO ENMs. The isotope-enriched ENMs were dosed into two different soils and were extracted and measured by spICP-TOF-MS after 1, 7, and 30 days. Isotope-enriched ENMs were recovered and detected for all three time points. The 47Ti-enriched TiO2 ENMs were detectable in Lufa 2.2 soil at a nominal dosed concentration of 10 mg-TiO2 kg-1 which is an environmentally relevant concentration in biosolid-amended soils. For distinguishing an ∼70 nm diameter TiO2 ENM from TiO2 NNMs in Lufa 2.2 soil, an ∼10 wt % 47Ti isotope-enrichment was required, and this enrichment requirement increases as the particle size decreases. This study is the first to evaluate the tracking ability of isotope-enriched ENMs at an individual particle level in soil and provides guidance on the isotope enrichment requirements for quantification of ENMs made from Earth-abundant elements in soils.",ENM detection limit; engineered nanomaterials; environmental forensics; isotope-enrichment; spICP-TOF-MS.

With respect to the multi-angle features of object orientation in HSRIs object detection, this paper presents a novel HSRIs object detection method based on convolutional neural networks (CNN) with adaptive object orientation features. First, an adaptive object orientation regression method is proposed to obtain object regions in any direction. In the adaptive object orientation regression method, five coordinate parameters are used to regress the object region with any direction. Then, a CNN framework for object detection of HSRIs is designed using the adaptive object orientation regression method. Using multiple object detection datasets, the proposed method is compared with some state-of-the-art object detection methods. The experimental results show that the proposed method can more accurately detect objects with large aspect ratios and densely distributed objects than some state-of-the-art object detection methods using a horizontal bounding box, and obtain better object detection results for HSRIs.",high spatial resolution remote sensing image; convolutional neural network; object detection; adaptive object orientation features; deep learning

We evaluated the inter-examiner reliability of this classification system. We prospectively recruited 48 male athletes (66 symptomatic sides) with groin pain between 10-2017 and 03-2020 at a sports medicine hospital in Qatar. Two examiners (23 and 10 years of clinical experience) performed history taking, and a standardized clinical examination blinded to each other's findings. Examiners classified groin pain using the Doha agreement terminology (adductor-, inguinal-, iliopsoas-, pubic-, hip-related groin pain, or other causes of groin pain). Multiple entities were ranked in order of perceived clinical importance. Each side was classified separately for bilateral groin pain. Inter-examiner reliability was calculated using Cohen's Kappa statistic (κ). Inter-examiner reliability was slight to moderate for adductor- (κ = 0.40), inguinal- (κ = 0.44), iliopsoas- (κ = 0.57), and pubic-related groin pain (κ = 0.12), substantial for hip-related groin pain (κ = 0.62), and slight for ""other causes of groin pain"" (κ = 0.13). Ranking entities in order of perceived clinical importance improved inter-examiner reliability for adductor-, inguinal-, and iliopsoas-related groin pain (κ = 0.52-0.65), but not for pubic (κ = 0.12), hip (κ = 0.51), and ""other causes of groin pain"" (κ = 0.03). For participants with unilateral groin pain classified with a single entity (n = 7), there was 100% agreement between the two examiners. Inter-examiner reliability of the Doha agreement meeting classification system varied from slight to substantial, depending on the clinical entity. Agreement between examiners was perfect when athletes were classified with a single clinical entity of groin pain, but lower when athletes were classified with multiple clinical entities.",clinical assessment; diagnosis; groin pain; hip/pelvis/thigh.

The model proposes selecting the best control function that keeps bounded a stochastic process over an interval of time with a high probability level. Here, the stochastic process is governed by a stochastic differential equation affected by a stochastic process. This setting becomes a chance-constrained control optimization problem, where the constraint is given by the probability level of infinitely many random inequalities. Since such a model is challenging, we discretize the dynamic and restrict the space of control functions to piecewise mappings. On the one hand, it transforms the infinite-dimensional optimization problem into a finite-dimensional one. On the other hand, it allows us to provide the well-posedness of the problem and approximation. Finally, the results are illustrated with numerical results, where classical model for the growth of a population are considered.",Chance constrained optimization; Control in Probability; Growth population models.

However, space targets are often non-cooperative, and normally a 360 degrees complete view of reflection projections cannot be obtained. Therefore, this article firstly introduces an improved LRT system design with more advanced laser equipment for long-distance non-cooperative detection to ensure the high quality of the lidar beam and the lidar projection data. Then, the LRT image reconstruction is proposed and focused on the laser image reconstruction method utilizing the total variation (TV) minimization approach based on the sparse algebraic reconstruction technique (ART) model, in order to reconstruct the laser image in a sparse or incomplete view of projections. At last, comparative experiments with the system are performed to validate the advantages of this method with the LRT system.

We propose spatio-temporal footstep representations from floor-only sensor data in advanced computational models for automatic biometric verification. Our models deliver an artificial intelligence capable of effectively differentiating the fine-grained variability of footsteps between legitimate users (clients) and impostor users of the biometric system. The methodology is validated in the largest to date footstep database, containing nearly 20,000 footstep signals from more than 120 users. The database is organized by considering a large cohort of impostors and a small set of clients to verify the reliability of biometric systems. We provide experimental results in 3 critical data-driven security scenarios, according to the amount of footstep data made available for model training: at airports security checkpoints (smallest training set), workspace environments (medium training set) and home environments (largest training set). We report state-of-the-art footstep recognition rates with an optimal equal false acceptance and false rejection rate (equal error rate) of 0.7 percent an improvement ratio of 371 percent compared to previous state-of-the-art.

91,SIFT-Based Homographies for Efficient Multiview Distributed Visual Sensing,"Dias, Andre Seixas; Brites, Catarina; Ascenso, Joao; Pereira, Fernando","Considering the scarce resources in visual sensor networks, video coding solutions are necessary to address these constraints, namely the limited energy, memory, and bandwidth. The distributed video coding (DVC) paradigm is able to address these limitations by shifting most of the complexity to the decoder, typically a central location with a significant amount of resources. In a DVC context, the video codec rate-distortion (RD) performance is strongly dependent on the efficient generation of the so-called side information (SI). While in monoview DVC solutions the SI is generated by exploiting only the temporal correlation between frames, in multiview DVC (MV-DVC) solutions, the SI may be estimated by exploiting both the temporal and interview correlations. In this paper, a novel MV-DVC solution is proposed to improve the state-of-the-art MV-DVC RD performance with two key contributions in terms of an interview SI creation and SI fusion. According to the obtained experimental results, the proposed solution improves the RD performance associated to the current MV-DVC state-of-the-art solutions, exhibiting bitrate savings similar to 10% for the same output video quality, without increasing the encoding complexity and eventually also the decoding complexity.",Distributed video coding; visual sensors; multiview; SIFT; homography; fusion
92,FAST Pre-Filtering-Based Real Time Road Sign Detection for Low-Cost Vehicle Localization,"Choi, Kyoungtaek; Suhr, Jae Kyu; Jung, Ho Gi","In order to overcome the limitations of GNSS/INS and to keep the cost affordable for mass-produced vehicles, a precise localization system fusing the estimated vehicle positions from low-cost GNSS/INS and low-cost perception sensors is being developed. For vehicle position estimation, a perception sensor detects a road facility and uses it as a landmark. For this localization system, this paper proposes a method to detect a road sign as a landmark using a monocular camera whose cost is relatively low compared to other perception sensors. Since the inside pattern and aspect ratio of a road sign are various, the proposed method is based on the part-based approach that detects corners and combines them to detect a road sign. While the recall, precision, and processing time of the state of the art detector based on a convolutional neural network are 99.63%, 98.16%, and 4802 ms respectively, the recall, precision, and processing time of the proposed method are 97.48%, 98.78%, and 66.7 ms, respectively. The detection performance of the proposed method is as good as that of the state of the art detector and its processing time is drastically reduced to be applicable for an embedded system.",low-cost sensor fusion-based precise localization; road sign detection; part-based method; corner detection; real-time processing
93,Transformer-Based Decoder Designs for Semantic Segmentation on Remotely Sensed Images,"Panboonyuen, Teerapong; Jitkajornwanich, Kulsawasd; Lawawirojwong, Siam; Srestasathiern, Panu; Vateekul, Peerapon","Transformers have demonstrated remarkable accomplishments in several natural language processing (NLP) tasks as well as image processing tasks. Herein, we present a deep-learning (DL) model that is capable of improving the semantic segmentation network in two ways. First, utilizing the pre-training Swin Transformer (SwinTF) under Vision Transformer (ViT) as a backbone, the model weights downstream tasks by joining task layers upon the pretrained encoder. Secondly, decoder designs are applied to our DL network with three decoder designs, U-Net, pyramid scene parsing (PSP) network, and feature pyramid network (FPN), to perform pixel-level segmentation. The results are compared with other image labeling state of the art (SOTA) methods, such as global convolutional network (GCN) and ViT. Extensive experiments show that our Swin Transformer (SwinTF) with decoder designs reached a new state of the art on the Thailand Isan Landsat-8 corpus (89.8% F1 score), Thailand North Landsat-8 corpus (63.12% F1 score), and competitive results on ISPRS Vaihingen. Moreover, both our best-proposed methods (SwinTF-PSP and SwinTF-FPN) even outperformed SwinTF with supervised pre-training ViT on the ImageNet-1K in the Thailand, Landsat-8, and ISPRS Vaihingen corpora.",vision transformer; fully transformer networks; convolutional neural network; feature pyramid network; high-resolution representations; ISPRS Vaihingen; Landsat-8

Inflammatory conditions, including antiphospholipid syndrome (APS), are a rare etiology making up less than 20% of reported cases. The condition is thought to be due to a hypercoagulable state and found postmortem with rates in autopsy series ranging from 0.9% to 1.6%. In comparison to infective endocarditis, marantic endocarditis has a greater tendency for valve vegetations to embolize. Common treatment modalities include anticoagulation or valve replacement. Although percutaneous aspiration thrombectomy of right-sided heart chamber thrombi exists, there are limited reports demonstrating its use with regards to treatment of right-sided endocarditis. We present the case of an older male with a history of Factor V Leiden and APS who was admitted due to a rapidly expanding mass on the tricuspid valve (TV). Despite serial blood cultures being negative, the patient received adequate antibiotic therapy for more than 4 weeks. Transthoracic echocardiogram showed an enlarged TV vegetation with an increased diameter from 10 to 30 mm over 6 weeks. Due to the patient's high operative risk and concern for embolization complications, a multidisciplinary decision was made to perform percutaneous aspiration thrombectomy of the TV vegetation. Subsequent biopsy of the lesion confirmed it was noninfectious and nonmalignant. Thus, the patient was started on systemic anticoagulation for prevention of thromboembolic events.",aspiration thrombectomy; hypercoagulable; nonbacterial thrombotic endocarditis; percutaneous coronary intervention.
95,MFNW: An MLC/TLC Flip-N-Write Architecture,"Alsuwaiyan, Ali; Mohanram, Kartik","The increased capacity of multi-level cells (MLC) and triple-level cells (TLC) in emerging non-volatile memory (NVM) technologies comes at the cost of higher cell write energies and lower cell endurance. In this article, we describe MFNW, a Flip-N-Write encoding that effectively reduces the write energy and improves the endurance of MLC NVMs. Two MFNW modes are analyzed: cell Hamming distance mode and energy Hamming distance mode. We derive an approximate model that accurately predicts the average number of cell writes that is proportional to the energy consumption, enabling word length optimization to maximize energy reduction subject to memory space overhead constraints. In comparison to state-of-the-art MLC NVM encodings, our simulation results indicate that MFNW achieves up to 7%-39% saving for 1.56%-50% NVM space overhead. Extra energy saving (up to 19%-47%) can be achieved for the same NVM space overhead using our proposed variations of MFNW, i.e., MFNW2 and MFNW3. For TLC NVMs, we propose TFNW that can achieve up to 53% energy saving in comparison to state-of-the-art TLC NVM encodings. Endurance simulations indicate that MFNW (TFNW) is capable of extending MLC (TLC) NVM life by up to 100% (87%).",Non-volatile memories; multi-level cell (MLC); triple-level cell (TLC); encoding; low power

Recently, the safety of these coils in a magnetic resonance environment has been called into question, with important ramifications for thousands of patients with existing coils in place. We performed a retrospective chart review at five tertiary care pediatric centers evaluating all children and young adults with implanted SSEC who underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Data reviewed included demographics, coil implantation, MRI studies, and follow-up evaluations. Complications such as heating, discomfort, or device migration were specifically sought. Two hundred and ninety-seven patients with implanted SSEC underwent 539 MRI examinations. The median age at SSEC implantation was 2.3 years (1 week-23.2 years). The MRI studies were performed a median of 7.4 years (4 days-23.1 years) after implantation. No patients experienced any reported complications associated with their MRI examinations during the study or at median follow-up post-MRI of 4.8 years (1 day-23 years). In this large, retrospective review of patients with implanted SSEC undergoing MRI, there were no reported adverse events.

In this paper, we derive simplified and unified mathematical formulations for inter-modulo operations, such as sign detection, magnitude comparison, scaling signed integers, and signed reverse conversion, grounded on the pillars of reverse conversion. These formulations, which cover a whole range of sets, with 3 to 5 moduli, are used to design components that when integrated allow the design of efficient complete multifunctional units, reusing blocks to perform several RNS intermodulo operations. Not only have the proposed individual components been compared with related art, but a con figuration of the proposed multifunctional unit has also been implemented in application specific integrated circuits. Experimental results show that the multifunctional unit is significantly more area and power effective than the other solutions proposed in the state of the art, and the performance of the individual components compare well with dedicated ones. The novel multifunctional units are thus a further step toward the integration of RNS systems on constrained systems.",Computer arithmetic; residue number system; residue arithmetic; modular processor

It is an excellent model to study hematopoiesis because of its highly conserved ontogeny and gene regulatory networks. Recently developed highly specific transgenic reporter lines have allowed direct imaging and tracking of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) in live zebrafish. These reporter lines can also be used for fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) of HSPCs. Similar to mammalian models, HSPCs can be transplanted to reconstitute the entire hematopoietic system of zebrafish recipients. However, the zebrafish provides unique advantages to study HSPC biology, such as transplants into embryos and high-throughput chemical screening.

A.; Schmoll, T.","Optical Coherence Tomography Angiography (OCTA), a functional extension of OCT, has the potential to replace most invasive fluorescein angiography (FA) exams in ophthalmology. So far, OCTA's field of view is however still lacking behind fluorescence fundus photography techniques. This is problematic, because many retinal diseases manifest at an early stage by changes of the peripheral retinal capillary network. It is therefore desirable to expand OCTA's field of view to match that of ultra-widefield fundus cameras. We present a custom developed clinical high-speed swept-source OCT (SS-OCT) system operating at an acquisition rate 8-16 times faster than today's state-of-the-art commercially available OCTA devices. Its speed allows us to capture ultra-wide fields of view of up to 90 degrees with an unprecedented sampling density and hence extraordinary resolution by merging two single shot scans with 60 degrees in diameter. To further enhance the visual appearance of the angiograms, we developed for the first time a three-dimensional deep learning based algorithm for denoising volumetric OCTA data sets.

The proposed method is configured as follows: first, wavelet transforms are applied to extract the feature vectors for identification of motor imagery electroencephalography (EEG) and principal component analyses are used to reduce the dimensionality of the feature vectors and linearly combine them. Subsequently, the GMM universal background model is trained by the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm to purify the training data and reduce its size. Finally, a purified and reduced GMM-supervector is used to train the support vector machine classifier. The performance of the proposed method was evaluated for three different motor imagery datasets in terms of accuracy, kappa, mutual information, and computation time, and compared with the state-of-the-art algorithms.

Results: PEP was internalized by cells at a fast rate and enhanced cellular proliferation and migration while attenuating apoptosis. These findings reflect the fact that PEP can increase the expression of PCNA and reduce the expression of CASP3/7/9 and BAX.

Thus, this article proposes a data-driven approach using the state-of-art machine learning techniques to assess and forecast the procurement risks of non-ferrous metals associated with complex manufacturing systems. A variety of state-of-art machine learning models including ANN, LSTM, BLSTM, GARCH, as well as their combinations which compose the proposed hybrid models, are deployed and analyzed. The testing results show that the proposed hybrid machine learning method can forecast the price uncertainty in procurement and effectively evaluate the procurement risk in a precautious manner. Moreover, it is shown that the hybrid model that combines GARCH, ANN, and LSTM significantly improves the forecasting results. Besides, the optimal choice of the network configurations in the hybrid model is also analyzed via a series of sensitivity analyses.

Clustering, the grouping of data without the presence of ground-truth labels, is an important tool for drawing inferences from data. Subspace clustering (SC) is a relatively recent method that is able to successfully classify nonlinearly separable data in a multitude of settings. In spite of their high clustering accuracy, SC methods incur prohibitively high computational complexity when processing large volumes of high-dimensional data. Inspired by random sketching approaches for dimensionality reduction, the present paper introduces a randomized scheme for SC, termed Sketch-SC, tailored for large volumes of high-dimensional data. Sketch-SC accelerates the computationally heavy parts of state-of-the-art SC approaches by compressing the data matrix across both dimensions using random projections, thus enabling fast and accurate large-scale SC. Performance analysis as well as extensive numerical tests on real data corroborate the potential of Sketch-SC and its competitive performance relative to state-of-the-art scalable SC approaches.",Subspace clustering; big data; random projections; sketching

The weight loss study proved B. cereus inoculum possessed anticorrosion efficiencies of 92.84% and 73.88% for 3-day and 14-day rotation tests, respectively. The electrochemical measurements indicated that the added B. cereus inoculum increased the charge transfer resistance and reduced corrosion current density. B. cereus cells with strong biofilm-forming capacity were able to adhere onto the Q235 CS surface to form compact biofilms and cause biomineralization. Surface characterization analysis demonstrated that the presence of the B. cereus inoculum reduced the amount of Fe2O3 and simultaneously increased the amount of CaCO3 in corrosion products. The corrosion inhibition mechanisms of the B. cereus inoculum involve forming biofilm, generating a biomineralized layer, and consuming dissolved oxygen. Thus, B. cereus inoculum provides a biological strategy for industrial cooling water anticorrosion application.",Biofilm; Biomineralization; Carbon steel; Cooling water; Corrosion inhibition.

One of the most exciting strategies for treating cancer is to design regulators that increase cell death and stop cell growth. Members of the BCL-2 family of proteins play an important role in the regulation of apoptosis. In this study, an attempt was made to improve the performance of one of the anticancer drugs by designing new analogs of venetoclax (VNT). For this purpose, molecular docking studies were performed to determine the best binding state of VNT and its newly designed derivatives at the protein-binding site to estimate the binding energy. The best analog in terms of free energy was VNT-12 with the lowest energy (-12.15 kcal/mol). Finally, to investigate the inhibitory effect of the compounds on BCL-2 protein, molecular dynamics simulation was used, and by performing the relevant analyses during the simulation, it was observed that the newly designed ligand had better performance in inhibiting BCL-2 protein compared to VNT.",BCL-2 protein; drug design; molecular docking; molecular dynamics; venetoclax.

The study included 1200 men treated for infertility without the use of assisted reproductive technology (non-ART), intrauterine insemination (IUI) and in vitro fertilization (IVF). The control group consisted of 100 healthy men with confirmed fertility. The quality of life assessed by the WHOQoL-BREF questionnaire was significantly lower in study groups in the Environmental domain, compared to the control group (p = 0.009). Statistically significant differences were found in the case of FertiQoL subscales: Emotional, Mind-Body, Relational, and Treatment Environment, depending on applied treatment. Men whose partners were treated without the use of ART assessed their QoL significantly more negatively than those treated with IUI. Reproductive problems and type of their treatment influenced the quality of life of the affected men.

108,Hybrid Ageing Patterns for face age estimation,"Ng, Choon-Ching; Yap, Moi Hoon; Cheng, Yi-Tseng; Hsu, Gee-Sern","Wrinkles can be embedded in several image-based applications as a descriptor for human skin. However, wrinkle-based age estimation research has not been widely addressed. In this paper, we introduce a Multi scale Wrinkle Patterns (MWP) representation, investigate the effect of wrinkles on face age estimation and propose Hybrid Ageing Patterns (HAP) for face age estimation. To define the wrinkle regions more precisely, a template consisting of 10 regions constructed relatively to a set of automatically located facial landmarks is used. We extract the multi-scale wrinkles in each region and encode them into MWP. We use Support Vector Regression to estimate age from the combination of such patterns. The performance of the algorithms is assessed by using Mean Absolute Error (MAE) on three state-of-the-art datasets-FG-NET, FERET and MORPH. We observe that MWP produces a comparable MAE of 4.16 on FERET to the state of the art. Finally we propose HAP, which combines the features from MWP and the facial appearance model (FAM), and demonstrate improved performance on FERET and MORPH with MAE of 3.02 (2.92) and 3.68 (2.98), respectively. Therefore, we conclude that MWP is an important complementary feature for face age estimation. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

The state-of-the-art multiresolution analysis pansharpening algorithms are based on the extraction of spatial details from the PAN image through image filters matched with the MS sensors' modulation transfer function. However, this knowledge is often poor due to measurement inaccuracies and/or its aging. Thus, deconvolution algorithms have been proposed to overcome this limitation. In this paper, we propose a multiband filter estimation (FE) approach to improve the solutions in the literature. The main idea in this paper is to exploit a preliminary pansharpened image to estimate the spatial filter used for detail extraction associated with each spectral band. We demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art FE approaches by employing data sets acquired by the IKONOS, the Quickbird, and the WorldVievv-3 sensors.",Deconvolution; image fusion; multiresolution analysis (MRA); pansharpening; remote sensing

The zebrafish skeleton is composed of craniofacial and axial skeletons. It shares a physiological curvature and consists of a similar number of vertebrae as humans. Bone degeneration and malformations have been widely studied in zebrafish as human disease models. High-resolution imaging and different bone properties such as density and volume can be obtained using micro-computed tomography (micro-CT). This study aimed to understand the possible changes in the structure and bone mineral density (BMD) of the vertebrae and craniofacial skeleton with age (4, 12 and 24 months post fertilisation [mpf]) in zebrafish. Our data showed that the BMD in the vertebrae and specific craniofacial skeleton (mandibular arch, ceratohyal and ethmoid plate) of 12 and 24 mpf fish were higher than that of the 4 mpf fish. In addition, we found the age-dependent increase in BMD was not ubiquitously observed in facial bones, and such differences were not correlated with bone type. In summary, such additional information on the craniofacial skeleton could help in understanding bone development throughout the lifespan of zebrafish.",bone density; bone type; fish head; imaging.

A.; Botella, G.; Cuesta, D.","Steganography is the art of hiding information within a file. This work focuses on embedding such information in videos. In this scenario, it is critical to comply with the latest video standard, namely: the High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC), which allows reducing the size of the file to be transmitted. In this paper we propose an HEVC-compliant method to hide and retrieve information in high-resolution videos. The procedure is based on modifying the luminance of certain blocks, not the HEVC encoder. Nevertheless, this must be carefully done, as the HEVC standard is a powerful attack in itself, since it compresses 50% the size of the video on average and the embedded information may disappear. Results show that it is possible to retrieve all the information while maintaining the quality of the video when using intra frames. Furthermore, the proposed flow has shown to be resilient to state-of-the-art steganalysis attacks. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Deciphering the orchestration of metabolic pathways in regulating ferroptosis will provide new insights into TNBC therapeutic strategies. Here, we integrated the multiomics data of our large TNBC cohort (n = 465) to develop the ferroptosis atlas. We discovered that TNBCs had heterogeneous phenotypes in ferroptosis-related metabolites and metabolic pathways. The luminal androgen receptor (LAR) subtype of TNBC was characterized by the upregulation of oxidized phosphatidylethanolamines and glutathione metabolism (especially GPX4), which allowed the utilization of GPX4 inhibitors to induce ferroptosis. Furthermore, we verified that GPX4 inhibition not only induced tumor ferroptosis but also enhanced antitumor immunity. The combination of GPX4 inhibitors and anti-PD1 possessed greater therapeutic efficacy than monotherapy. Clinically, higher GPX4 expression correlated with lower cytolytic scores and worse prognosis in immunotherapy cohorts. Collectively, this study demonstrated the ferroptosis landscape of TNBC and revealed an innovative immunotherapy combination strategy for refractory LAR tumors.",fatty acid metabolism; ferroptosis; heterogeneity; immunotherapy; treatment; triple-negative breast cancer.

However, most current approaches only identify the overall polarity of a sentence, instead of the polarity of each aspect mentioned in the sentence. Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) identifies the aspects within the given sentence, and the sentiment that was expressed for each aspect. Recently, the use of pre-trained models such as BERT has achieved state-of-the-art results in the field of natural language processing. In this paper, we propose two ensemble models based on multilingual-BERT, namely, mBERT-E-MV and mBERT-E-AS. Using different methods, we construct an auxiliary sentence from this aspect and convert the ABSA problem to a sentence-pair classification task. We then fine-tune different pre-trained BERT models and ensemble them for a final prediction based on the proposed model; we achieve new, state-of-the-art results for datasets belonging to different domains in the Hindi language.",aspect-based sentiment analysis; BERT; classification; ensemble; Hindi

This forced teachers and pupils to heavily rely on information and communications technology (ICT) and make adjustments to the new mode of teaching and learning in educational institutions. We conducted a qualitative case study by interviewing 24 teachers from Slovene primary schools focusing on the implementation of cross-curricular connections in music and visual arts content with the support of ICT during the period of emergency remote teaching. We found that when planning and implementing the cross-curricular learning process, teachers insufficiently took advantage of possibilities offered by modern ICT. The manner of implementing cross-curricular connections showed uncertainties in terms of understanding their specifics, resulting in the inefficient transfer of concepts taught, the results of which were seen in pupils' work. This might additionally show the negative influence of parental supervision on the creative thinking and expression of pupils. The present study emphasizes the lack of ICT competences on the part of all participants in the educational process.

METHODS: From a larger sample of medical specialists, an analytic, cross-sectional study was conducted with 566 participants, including 317 (56%) family medicine residents and 249 (44%) family doctors in Mexico through an online survey. Demographic features, professional activities and adversities, mental health, and perceived discrimination were examined. Descriptive and comparative analyses were performed. Cramer's V for chi-square tests and Hedge's g for t test were conducted to determine effect sizes. RESULTS: Both sexes displayed similar percentages of professional adversities (such as attending patients with suicidal behavior or who died not by suicide under their care), and a higher number of women reported seeking specialized support to cope with these deaths (Fisher = 0.04). Men perceived greater discrimination (P = .01), worked more hours per day (P < .001) and were more verbally assaulted (P = .04), whereas women reported mental health problems more frequently (P < .001) particularly depression, anxiety, burnout and sleeping problems. Women also reported worse health status (P < .001) when compared with men. CONCLUSION: Family medicine specialists constitute a vulnerable group for mental health problems and perceived discrimination. Particular attention should be paid to how men and women cope with professional adversities to determine whether additional support is required. Interventions should encourage self-care and promote the well-being of health personnel.",Cross-Sectional Studies; Family Medicine; Gender Differences; Medical Students; Mental Health; Mexico; Perceived Discrimination; Self-Report.
117,CNN weight sharing based on a fast accuracy estimation metric,"Dupuis, Etienne; Novo, David; O'Connor, Ian; Bosio, Alberto","The computational workload involved in CNNs is typically out of reach for low-power embedded devices. The Approximate Computing paradigm can be exploited to reduce the CNN complexity since it improves performances and energy-efficiency by relaxing the need for fully accurate operations. In this work, we target weightsharing as an approximate technique to reduce the memory footprint of a CNN. More in detail, we prove that optimizing the number of shared weights can enable significant network memory compression without noticeable accuracy loss without retraining or fine-tuning steps. However, we observe that the exploration time can easily explode in state-of-the-art CNNs. We thus propose the use of a fast accuracy estimation metric to guide the design space exploration and drastically reduce the exploration time up to 12x. Compared with state-of-the-art CNN approximation methods, we obtained more than 4x compression on GoogleNet on the ImageNet dataset with less than 1% accuracy loss in less than 5 h and without any retraining step.",Convolutional neural networks; Approximate computing; Model compression; Weight sharing; Design space exploration; Embedded system
118,Longitudinal Invariance of the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire Across Ages 4 to 16 in the ALSPAC Sample,"Lydia Gabriela Speyer,Bonnie Auyeung,Aja Louise Murray,Lydia Gabriela Speyer,Bonnie Auyeung,Aja Louise Murray","The Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) has been widely used to study children's psychosocial development longitudinally; however, such analyses assume longitudinal measurement invariance, that is, they presuppose that symptom manifestations are measured comparably across different ages. Violations of this assumption could bias longitudinal analyses and should therefore be empirically tested. This study tested longitudinal measurement invariance within a confirmatory factor analysis framework in the U.K.-based Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (N = 13,988). Results indicated that SDQ scores showed configural, metric, scalar, and residual invariance across ages 7, 8, 9, 11, 13, and 16, supporting its use for comparing variances, covariances, and means over time within a latent variable model as well as using observed scores. At age 4, configural invariance was not supported, indicating that mental health symptoms as measured by the SDQ manifest differently at this age, thus necessitating caution when comparing symptoms as measured by SDQ scores at this age to later ages.",ALSPAC; Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire; confirmatory factor analysis; longitudinal measurement invariance.

The occurrence of Steven-Johnson syndrome (SJS) or toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) with nivolumab use is an exceedingly rare phenomenon that was only documented in a handful of cases in the current literature, but it deserves careful attention as SJS/TEN may be associated with fatal outcomes. We present a case of nivolumab-induced SJS/TEN in a middle-aged female patient with metastatic gastric adenocarcinoma that was successfully treated with immunosuppressive therapy and supportive care. Prompt recognition of SJS/TEN with discontinuation of nivolumab is warranted when SJS/TEN is suspected clinically.

ESL tool sales were around $460 million in 2011. The value of the ICs designed using these tools is at least an order of magnitude more. Concurrently, advanced IC reverse engineering techniques are being developed and used by attackers. In response, several anti-reverse engineering techniques have been proposed for integration into the IC design flow. An important class of defenses hardens the controllers that orchestrate the functionality of designs generated by ESL tools. We demonstrate an attack to recover the controller in any ESL-generated design even if the controller has been hardened using state-of-the-art controller hardening techniques. The attack analyzes the unhardened parts of the controller (i.e., the controller output logic and datapath) and reconciles this information with the architectural, controller, and timing constraints implicit in and underlying all ESL design methodologies. We then propose a countermeasure that inserts decoy connections into an ESL tool-generated design to thwart reverse engineering. We introduce a security metric to quantify the effectiveness of the developed attacks and defenses. We demonstrate the attack and defenses on designs generated by state-of-the-art ESL tools.",Hardware security; high-level synthesis; intellectual property protection; piracy
123,Scene Classification via a Gradient Boosting Random Convolutional Network Framework,"Zhang, Fan; Du, Bo; Zhang, Liangpei","Due to the recent advances in satellite sensors, a large amount of high-resolution remote sensing images is now being obtained each day. How to automatically recognize and analyze scenes from these satellite images effectively and efficiently has become a big challenge in the remote sensing field. Recently, a lot of work in scene classification has been proposed, focusing on deep neural networks, which learn hierarchical internal feature representations from image data sets and produce state-of-the-art performance. However, most methods, including the traditional shallow methods and deep neural networks, only concentrate on training a single model. Meanwhile, neural network ensembles have proved to be a powerful and practical tool for a number of different predictive tasks. Can we find a way to combine different deep neural networks effectively and efficiently for scene classification? In this paper, we propose a gradient boosting random convolutional network (GBRCN) framework for scene classification, which can effectively combine many deep neural networks. As far as we know, this is the first time that a deep ensemble framework has been proposed for scene classification. Moreover, in the experiments, the proposed method was applied to two challenging high-resolution data sets: 1) the UC Merced data set containing 21 different aerial scene categories with a submeter resolution and 2) a Sydney data set containing eight land-use categories with a 1.0-m spatial resolution. The proposed GBRCN framework outperformed the state-of-the-art methods with the UC Merced data set, including the traditional single convolutional network approach. For the Sydney data set, the proposed method again obtained the best accuracy, demonstrating that the proposed framework can provide more accurate classification results than the state-of-the-art methods.",Convolutional networks (CNets); gradient boosting machine (GBM); scene classification
124,Complementary Discriminative Correlation Filters Based on Collaborative Representation for Visual Object Tracking,"Zhu, Xue-Feng; Wu, Xiao-Jun; Xu, Tianyang; Feng, Zhen-Hua; Kittler, Josef","In recent years, discriminative correlation filter (DCF) based algorithms have significantly advanced the state of the art in visual object tracking. The key to the success of DCF is an efficient discriminative regression model trained with powerful multi-cue features, including both hand-crafted and deep neural network features. However, the tracking performance is hindered by their inability to respond adequately to abrupt target appearance variations. This issue is posed by the limited representation capability of fixed image features. In this work, we set out to rectify this shortcoming by proposing a complementary representation of a visual content. Specifically, we propose the use of a collaborative representation between successive frames to extract the dynamic appearance information from a target with rapid appearance changes, which results in suppressing the undesirable impact of the background. The resulting collaborative representation coefficients are combined with the original feature maps using a spatially regularised DCF framework for performance boosting. The experimental results on several benchmarking datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method, as compared with a number of state-of-the-art tracking algorithms.",Feature extraction; Target tracking; Visualization; Collaboration; Adaptation models; Robustness; Object tracking; Visual object tracking; discriminative correlation filter; feature representation; collaborative representation

Despite the low pH and high water contents of vegetables and fresh, ripened fruits, they are prone to fungal and bacterial diseases. The ever-increasing resistance of phytopathogens toward pesticides, fungicides and bactericides has resulted in substantial threats to plant growth and production in recent years. However, plant-mediated nanoparticles are useful tools for combating parasitic fungi and bacteria. Herein, we synthesized biogenic manganese oxide nanoparticles (MnONPs) from an extract of Punica granatum (P. granatum), and these nanoparticles showed significant antifungal and antibacterial activities. The production of MnONPs from plant extracts was confirmed by infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and UV visible spectroscopy (UV). The surface morphology and shape of the nanoparticles were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Using a detached fruit method, the MnONPs were shown to exhibit significant antimicrobial activities against two bacterial strains, E. coli and S. aureus, and against the fungal species P. digitatum. The results revealed that the MnONPs had a minimum antimicrobial activity at 25 µg/mL and a maximum antimicrobial activity at 100 µg/mL against bacterial strains in lemon (citrus). Furthermore, the MnONPs exhibited significant ROS scavenging activity. Finally, inconclusive results from the green-synthesized MnONPs magnified their significant synergetic effects on the shelf life of tomatoes (Lycopercicum esculantum) and indicated that they could be used to counteract the phytopathological effects of postharvest fungal diseases in fruits and vegetables. Overall, this method of MnONPs synthesis is inexpensive, rapid and ecofriendly. MnONPs can be used as potential antimicrobial agents against different microbial species.",Antimicrobial activity; Antioxidant; Edible coating; Green nanoparticles; Postharvest pathogen.
126,Possible effects of dietary advanced glycation end products on maternal and fetal health: a review,"Büşra Demirer,Gülhan Samur,Büşra Demirer,Gülhan Samur","Excessive accumulation of advanced glycation end products (AGEs) in the body has been associated with many adverse health conditions. The common point of the pathologies associated at this point is oxidative stress and inflammation. Pregnancy is an important period in which many physiological, psychological, and biological changes are experienced. Along with the physiological changes that occur during this period, the mother maintaining an AGE-rich diet may cause an increase in the body's AGE pool and may increase oxidative stress and inflammation, as seen in healthy individuals. Studies have reported the negative effects of maternal AGE levels on maternal and fetal health during pregnancy. Although gestational diabetes, preeclampsia, endothelial dysfunction, and pelvic diseases constitute maternal complications, a number of pathological conditions such as intrauterine growth retardation, premature birth, neural tube defect, neurobehavioral developmental disorders, fetal death, and neonatal asphyxia constitute fetal complications. It is thought that the mechanisms of these complications have not been confirmed yet and more clinical studies are needed on this subject. The possible effects of dietary AGE levels during pregnancy on maternal and fetal health are examined in this review.",advanced glycation end products; fetal health; maternal health; nutrition pregnancy.

However, the majority of research has verified only the short-term efficacy through acute studies in laboratory tests owing to the lack of a reliable miniaturized platform for long-term animal studies. The construction of a sufficient integrated system for such a platform is extremely difficult because it requires multi-disciplinary work using state-of-the-art technologies in a wide range of fields. In this study, we propose a complete system of an implantable platform for long-term preclinical brain studies. Our proposed system, the extra-cranial brain activator (ECBA), consists of a titanium-packaged implantable module and a helmet-type base station that powers the module wirelessly. The ECBA can also be controlled by a remote handheld device. Using the ECBA, we performed a long-term non-anesthetic study with multiple canine subjects, and the resulting PET-CT scans demonstrated remarkable enhancement in brain activity relating to memory and sensory skills. Furthermore, the histological analysis and high-temperature aging test confirmed the reliability of the system for up to 31 months. Hence, the proposed ECBA system is expected to lead a new paradigm of human neuromodulation studies in the near future.",Electrodes; In vivo; Surgery; Satellite broadcasting; Rodents; Integrated circuits; Switching circuits; Aging test; brain activation system; biocompatible; high frequency stimulation; histologic analysis; long-term non-anesthetic preclinical study; neuro-modulation

However, it remains unclear, if and in what way IS influences cognition. Here, we conducted an fMRI experiment, in which 13 healthy participants were exposed to IS, while cognitive performance was assessed in an n-back working memory paradigm. During the task, short sinusoidal tone bursts of 12 Hz were administered monaurally with sound pressure levels that had been determined individually in a categorical loudness scaling session prior to the fMRI experiment. We found that task execution was associated with a significant activation of the prefrontal and the parietal cortex, as well as the striatum and the cerebellum, indicating the recruitment of a cognitive control network. Reverse contrast analysis (n-back with tone vs. n-back without tone) revealed a significant activation of the bilateral primary auditory cortex (Brodmann areas 41, 42). Surprisingly, we also found a strong, yet non-significant trend for an improvement of task performance during IS exposure. There was no correlation between performance and brain activity measures in tone and no-tone condition with sum scores of depression-, anxiety-, and personality factor assessment scales (BDI, STAIX1/X2, BFI-S). Although exerting a pronounced effect on cortical brain activity, we obtained no evidence for an impairment of cognition due to brief bursts of IS. On the contrary, potential improvement of working memory function introduces an entirely new aspect to the debate on IS-related effects.",Auditory system; Cognitive processing; Infrasound; N-back; Working memory; fMRI.

The recent increase in S. parauberis infection in aquatic farms in South Korea has justified the importance of vaccine development for the prevention of this disease. In this study, we evaluated the effect of subunit vaccines prepared from recombinant M-like protein (SimA) and fibrinogen-binding protein (FBP) candidates with an aluminum hydroxide adjuvant against S. parauberis infection in olive flounder Paralichthys olivaceus. For the in vivo experiment, fish (average length, 7.18 cm; average weight, 3.5 g) were injected intraperitoneally with: phosphate buffer saline (PBS, group 1), PBS/aluminum hydroxide (group 2), FBP/aluminum hydroxide (group 3), SimA/aluminum hydroxide (group 4), and SimA/FBP/aluminum hydroxide (group 5). After 3 weeks, the fish in each group were boosted using PBS (group 1 and 2), FBP (group 3), SimA (group 4), and SimA/FBP (group 5) without adjuvant. We found that the relative percent survival of fish after S. parauberis exposure in group 2, 3, 4, and 5 was 6.25%, 18.75%, 50%, and 12.5%, respectively, whereas the mortality in groups 1 was 80%, respectively. We performed Western blot, ELISA, and quantitative real time RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) after vaccination to investigate the further efficacy of the vaccine. Western blot and ELISA of vaccinated fish serum confirmed the production of specific antibodies against SimA and FBP. Furthermore, results of qRT-PCR showed that recombinant protein SimA induced a remarkably specific-antibody response compared with that in FBP or control and increased the expression of various immune response-related genes including interleukin-8 (IL-8), toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), CD4-1, and MHC II.

The science of rheology, which deals with the deformation and flow of matter, has grown considerably from its earlier focus on polymer melts and solutions and their processing methods to hydrogels with new processing procedures, such as bioprinting. The main objective of this paper is to discuss the impact of the rheology of collagen hydrogels on micro-extrusion and layer-stacking stages of bioprinting. Generally, the rheological characterization of hydrogels, including collagens by dynamic measurements under small deformations, is considered sufficient to evaluate their bioprinting performance. However, we brought out the importance of other rheological properties of collagen networks, such as steady-state shear flow conditions and large amplitude oscillator shear. While the dynamic measurements under small deformations help characterize the crosslinking and gel formations of the collagen, the steady shear flow measurements are better tools for investigating filament micro-extrusion and layer-stacking stages of a bioprinting process. We brought the role of other non-Newtonian material functions, such as first normal stress difference and extensional viscosity in addition to shear viscosity, for the first time. Extensional viscosity and the viscoelasticity manifested through normal-stress differences are significant in capillary (needle) flow. We also suggested caution to use dynamic viscosity vs. oscillation frequency under small deformations in place of steady shear viscosity vs. shear rate measurement. In addition, we brought out the importance of the large amplitude oscillatory shear test to investigate the collagen networks under large deformations. Finally, we discussed the role of crosslinking and flow conditions on cell viability. Those discussions are focused on collagen networks; nevertheless, they are valid on the bioprinting of other hydrogels.",bioprinting; cell viability; collagen; micro-extrusion; rheology; tissue engineering.

COB is computationally efficient, because it requires a single CNN forward pass for multi-scale contour detection and it uses a novel sparse boundary representation for hierarchical segmentation; it gives a significant leap in performance over the state-of-the-art, and it generalizes very well to unseen categories and datasets. Particularly, we show that learning to estimate not only contour strength but also orientation provides more accurate results. We perform extensive experiments for low-level applications on BSDS, PASCAL Context, PASCAL Segmentation, and NYUD to evaluate boundary detection performance, showing that COB provides state-of-the-art contours and region hierarchies in all datasets. We also evaluate COB on high-level tasks when coupled with multiple pipelines for object proposals, semantic contours, semantic segmentation, and object detection on MS-COCO, SBD, and PASCAL; showing that COB also improves the results for all tasks.",Contour detection; contour orientation; hierarchical image segmentation; object proposals; semantic contours

Postacute rehabilitation can decrease long-term sepsis mortality, but its impact on nursing care dependency, health care use, and costs is insufficiently understood. Objectives: To assess the short-term (7-12 months postdischarge) and long-term (13-36 months postdischarge) effect of inpatient rehabilitation within 6 months after hospitalization on mortality, nursing care dependency, health care use, and costs. Methods: An observational cohort study used health claims data from the health insurer AOK (Allgemeine Ortskrankenkasse). Among 23.0 million AOK beneficiaries, adult beneficiaries hospitalized with sepsis in 2013-2014 were identified by explicit codes from the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision. The study included patients who were nonemployed presepsis, for whom rehabilitation is reimbursed by the AOK and thus included in the dataset, and who survived at least 6 months postdischarge. The effect of rehabilitation was estimated by statistical comparisons of patients with rehabilitation (treatment group) and those without (reference group). Possible differential effects were investigated for the subgroup of ICU-treated sepsis survivors. The study used inverse probability of treatment weighting based on propensity scores to adjust for differences in relevant covariates. Costs for rehabilitation in the 6 months postsepsis were not included in the cost analysis. Results: Among 41,918 6-month sepsis survivors, 17.2% (n = 7,224) received rehabilitation. There was no significant difference in short-term survival between survivors with and without rehabilitation. Long-term survival rates were significantly higher in the rehabilitation group (90.4% vs. 88.7%; odds ratio [OR] = 1.2; 95% confidence interval [95% CI] = 1.1-1.3; P = 0.003). Survivors with rehabilitation had a higher mean number of hospital readmissions (7-12 months after sepsis: 0.82 vs. 0.76; P = 0.014) and were more frequently dependent on nursing care (7-12 months after sepsis: 47.8% vs. 42.3%; OR = 1.2; 95% CI = 1.2-1.3; P < 0.001; 13-36 months after sepsis: 52.5% vs. 47.5%; OR = 1.2; 95% CI = 1.1-1.3; P < 0.001) compared with those without rehabilitation, whereas total health care costs at 7-36 months after sepsis did not differ between groups. ICU-treated sepsis patients with rehabilitation had higher short- and long-term survival rates (short-term: 93.5% vs. 90.9%; OR = 1.5; 95% CI = 1.2-1.7; P < 0.001; long-term: 89.1% vs. 86.3%; OR = 1.3; 95% CI = 1.1-1.5; P < 0.001) than ICU-treated sepsis patients without rehabilitation. Conclusions: Rehabilitation within the first 6 months after ICU- and non-ICU-treated sepsis is associated with increased long-term survival within 3 years after sepsis without added total health care costs.

It has been hypothesized that the dietary pathway of vitamin B12 (B12) may be exploited in this area, but an open question is whether B12-peptide conjugates bound to the B12 gastric uptake protein intrinsic factor (IF) can provide any stability against proteases. Herein, we describe a new conjugate of B12 with the incretin peptide exendin 4 that demonstrates picomolar agonism of the glugacon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP1-R). Stability studies reveal that Ex-4 is digested by pancreatic proteases trypsin and chymotrypsin and by the kidney endopeptidase meprin β. Prebinding the B12 conjugate to IF, however, resulted in up to a 4-fold greater activity of the B12-Ex-4 conjugate relative to Ex-4, when the IF-B12-Ex-4 complex was exposed to 22 μg/mL of trypsin, 2.3-fold greater activity when exposed to 1.25 μg/mL of chymotrypsin, and there was no decrease in function at up to 5 μg/mL of meprin β.",AKAR3; exendin-4; intrinsic factor; trypsin; vitamin B12.

138,Elimination of position sensors in switched reluctance motor drives: State of the art and future trends,"Ehsani, M; Fahimi, B","This paper covers the range of topics related to sensorless control of switched reluctance motor (SRM) drives from their fundamentals to their limitations and state of the art and future trends. This should help the reader to develop a systematic understanding of the sensorless techniques that have been developed over the past two decades. The inherent vulnerability to mechanical failures, extra cost, and size associated with external position sensors such as optical encoders, resolvers, and custom-designed Hall-effect sensors has motivated many researchers to develop sensorless control techniques for SRM drives. Ideally, it is desirable to have a sensorless scheme, which uses only terminal measurements and does not require additional hardware or memory while maintaining a reliable operation over the entire speed and torque range with high resolution and accuracy. Recent advances in the development of low-cost digital-signal-processor-based microcontrollers have paved the way for the fulfillment of this objective. It is, furthermore, our view that the existing trends in the development of more powerful processors will ultimately replace the concept of sensorless controls with the concept of eliminating the need for position sensing, a concept that will further revolutionize the motor drive technology.",adjustable-speed motor drives; motor controls; motor drives; reluctance motors; sensorless controls; switched reluctance motors; variable reluctance motors

143,Category structure and region-specific selective attention,"Robert M Nosofsky,Mingjia Hu,Robert M Nosofsky,Mingjia Hu","A fundamental component of human categorization involves learning to attend selectively to relevant dimensions and ignore irrelevant ones. Past research has shown that humans can learn flexible strategies in which the attended dimensions vary depending on the region of feature space in which classification takes place. However, region-specific selective attention (RSA) is often challenging to learn. Here, we test the hypothesis that RSA is facilitated when individual categories are embedded within single regions of stimulus space rather than dispersed across multiple regions. We conduct an experiment that varies across conditions whether categories are embedded within regions, but in which the same RSA strategy would benefit performance across the conditions. To evaluate the hypothesis, we use measures of overall performance accuracy as well as comparisons among formal computational models that do and do not make allowance for RSA. We find strong support for the hypothesis among the upper-median-performing participants in the tested groups. However, even in the condition that promotes the learning of RSA, performance is considerably worse than in comparison conditions in which a single set of dimensions can be attended throughout the entire stimulus space.",Categorization.

Real-time feedback of acoustic shadows can guide sonographers to a standardized diagnostic viewing plane with minimal artifacts and can provide additional information for other automatic image analysis algorithms. However, automatically detecting shadow regions using learning-based algorithms is challenging because pixel-wise ground truth annotation of acoustic shadows is subjective and time consuming. In this paper, we propose a weakly supervised method for automatic confidence estimation of acoustic shadow regions. Our method is able to generate a dense shadow-focused confidence map. In our method, a shadow-seg module is built to learn general shadow features for shadow segmentation, based on global image-level annotations as well as a small number of coarse pixel-wise shadow annotations. A transfer function is introduced to extend the obtained binary shadow segmentation to a reference confidence map. In addition, a confidence estimation network is proposed to learn the mapping between input images and the reference confidence maps. This network is able to predict shadow confidence maps directly from input images during inference. We use evaluation metrics such as DICE, inter-class correlation, and so on, to verify the effectiveness of our method. Our method is more consistent than human annotation and outperforms the state-of-the-art quantitatively in shadow segmentation and qualitatively in confidence estimation of shadow regions. Furthermore, we demonstrate the applicability of our method by integrating shadow confidence maps into tasks such as ultrasound image classification, multi-view image fusion, and automated biometric measurements.",Ultrasound imaging; deep learning; weakly supervised; shadow detection; confidence estimation

Existing deep learning works almost neglect the inherent structural information of images, which acts as an important role for visual perception of SR results. In this paper, we design a hierarchical feature exploitation network to probe and preserve structural information in a multi-scale feature fusion manner. First, we propose a cross convolution upon traditional edge detectors to localize and represent edge features. Then, cross convolution blocks (CCBs) are designed with feature normalization and channel attention to consider the inherent correlations of features. Finally, we leverage multi-scale feature fusion group (MFFG) to embed the cross convolution blocks and develop the relations of structural features in different scales hierarchically, invoking a lightweight structure-preserving network named as Cross-SRN. Experimental results demonstrate the Cross-SRN achieves competitive or superior restoration performances against the state-of-the-art methods with accurate and clear structural details. Moreover, we set a criterion to select images with rich structural textures. The proposed Cross-SRN outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on the selected benchmark, which demonstrates that our network has a significant advantage in preserving edges.",Image edge detection; Convolution; Image restoration; Feature extraction; Information filters; Visualization; Superresolution; Image super-resolution; cross convolution; multi-scale feature fusion; structure-preservation

We show that the combination of head pose estimation and landmark-based face alignment significantly improve the performance of the former task. Further, the location of the pose task at the bottleneck layer, at the end of the encoder, and that of tasks depending on spatial information, such as visibility and alignment, in the final decoder layer, also contribute to increase the final performance. In the experiments conducted the proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-art in the face pose and visibility tasks. By including a final landmark regression step it also produces face alignment results on par with the state-of-the-art.",Task analysis; Face recognition; Pose estimation; Magnetic heads; Training; Faces; Decoding; Head pose estimation; multi-task learning; face alignment; occlusions detection

Fucosylation of mucins increases mucus viscoelasticity and its resistance to shear stress. These properties are altered in patients with ulcerative colitis (UC), which is marked by a chronic inflammation of the distal part of the colon. Here, we show that levels of Fucosyltransferase 8 (FUT8) and specific mucins are increased in the distal inflamed colon of UC patients. Recapitulating this FUT8 overexpression in mucin-producing HT29-18N2 colonic cell line increases delivery of MUC1 to the plasma membrane and extracellular release of MUC2 and MUC5AC. Mucins secreted by FUT8 overexpressing cells are more resistant to removal from the cell surface than mucins secreted by FUT8-depleted cells (FUT8 KD). FUT8 KD causes intracellular accumulation of MUC1 and alters the ratio of secreted MUC2 to MUC5AC. These data fit well with the Fut8-/- mice phenotype, which are protected from UC. Fut8-/- mice exhibit a thinner proximal colon mucus layer with an altered ratio of neutral to acidic mucins. Together, our data reveal that FUT8 modifies the biophysical properties of mucus by controlling levels of cell surface MUC1 and quantity and quality of secreted MUC2 and MUC5AC. We suggest that these changes in mucus viscoelasticity likely facilitate bacterial-epithelial interactions leading to inflammation and UC progression.",FUT8; fucosylation; mucin secretion; ulcerative colitis.

150,AEDCN-Net: Accurate and Efficient Deep Convolutional Neural Network Model for Medical Image Segmentation,"Olimov, Bekhzod; Koh, Seok-Joo; Kim, Jeonghong","Image segmentation was significantly enhanced after the emergence of deep learning (DL) methods. In particular, deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) have assisted DL-based segmentation models to achieve state-of-the-art performance in fields critical to human beings, such as medicine. However, the existing state-of-the-art methods often use computationally expensive operations to achieve high accuracy and lightweight networks often lack a precise medical image segmentation. Therefore, this study proposes an accurate and efficient DCNN model (AEDCN-Net) based on an elaborate preprocessing step and a resourceful model architecture. The AEDCN-Net exploits bottleneck, atrous, and asymmetric convolution-based residual skip connections in the encoding path that reduce the number of trainable parameters and floating point operations (FLOPs) to learn feature representations with a larger receptive field. The decoding path employs the nearest-neighbor based upsampling method instead of a computationally resourceful transpose convolution operation that requires an extensive number of trainable parameters. The proposed method attains a superior performance in both computational time and accuracy compared to the existing state-of-the-art methods. The results of benchmarking using four real-life medical image datasets specifically illustrate that the AEDCN-Net has a faster convergence compared to the computationally expensive state-of-the-art models while using significantly fewer trainable parameters and FLOPs that result in a considerable speed-up during inference. Moreover, the proposed method obtains a better accuracy in several evaluation metrics compared with the existing lightweight and efficient methods.",Image segmentation; Biomedical imaging; Computational modeling; Convolutional neural networks; Computer architecture; Task analysis; Convolution; Computational efficiency; deep convolutional neural networks; medical image segmentation

Here we present results from three studies of pulmonary exposure and toxicity of ZnO NP in mice. The studies were prematurely terminated because interim results unexpectedly showed severe pulmonary toxicity. High bolus doses of ZnO NP (25 up to 100 μg; ≥1.4 mg/kg) were clearly associated with a dose dependent mortality in the mice. Lower doses (≥6 μg; ≥0.3 mg/kg) elicited acute toxicity in terms of reduced weight gain, desquamation of epithelial cells with concomitantly increased barrier permeability of the alveolar/blood as well as DNA damage. Oxidative stress was shown via a strong increase in lipid peroxidation and reduced glutathione in the pulmonary tissue. Two months post-exposure revealed no obvious toxicity for 12.5 and 25 μg on a range of parameters. However, mice that survived a high dose (50 μg; 2.7 mg/kg) had an increased pulmonary collagen accumulation (fibrosis) at a similar level as a high bolus dose of crystalline silica. The recovery from these toxicological effects appeared dose-dependent. The results indicate that alveolar deposition of ZnO NP may cause significant adverse health effects.",Cytotoxicity; DNA damage; Fibrosis; Inflammation; Mortality; Oxidative stress.

However, there are still a lot of restrictions here, one of which is the demand for massive amounts of sampled data. In this paper, a hierarchical meta-learning method based on the actor-critic algorithm is proposed for sample efficient learning. This method provides the transferable knowledge that can efficiently train an actor on a new task with a few trials. Specifically, a global basic critic, meta critic, and task specified network are shared within a distribution of tasks and are capable of criticizing any actor trying to solve any specified task. The hierarchical framework is applied to a critic network in the actor-critic algorithm for distilling meta-knowledge above the task level and addressing distinct tasks. The proposed method is evaluated on multiple classic control tasks with reinforcement learning algorithms, including the start-of-the-art meta-learning methods.

However, the research of the NLRP3 inflammasome in teleost is limited. Tetraodon nigroviridis has the characteristics of small genome and easy feeding, which can be used as a model for the study of fish immune function. In present study, three NLRP3 inflammasome component genes (NLRP3, ASC and caspase-1) in T. nigroviridis has been cloned. Real-time fluorescence quantitative PCR showed that TnNLRP3 (T. nigroviridis NLRP3), TnASC (T. nigroviridis ASC) and Tncaspase-1 (T. nigroviridis caspase-1) mRNA in various tissues from health T. nigroviridis were highly expressed in immune-related tissues, such as spleen, gill, head kidney and intestine. After Vibrio parahemolyticus infection, the expression of TnNLRP3, TnASC and Tncaspase-1 mRNA in spleen, gill, head kidney reached a peak at 24 h, and the expression levels of these genes in intestine were the highest at 48 h. After the transfection of TnASC-pAcGFP-N1 monomer GFP plasmid into cos-7 cells, ASC specks, the activation marker of NLRP3 inflammasome, were observed. Bimolecular fluorescence complementarity and fluorescence colocation experiment showed that TnASC and Tncaspase-1 of TnNLRP3 inflammasome were co-located near the cell nucleus, and potentially interacted with each other. NLRP3 inflammasome inducer nigericin and agonist ATP could significantly induce the expression of TnNLRP3, TnASC and Tncaspase-1 mRNA, and activation of NLRP3 inflammasome could promote the generation of mature TnIL-1β (T. nigroviridis IL-1β).

But unfortunately, the accuracy level of the point process model is not comparable with the state-of-the-art KWS systems because of the poor modeling capacity of the phoneme detector, which are based on Gaussian Mixture Models. In this paper, focus on improving the performance of detector in point process model, we propose an enhanced version of point process model, which is based on hierarchical deep belief networks (DBNs). Hierarchical DBNs are used as the phoneme detector in this system, and they combine the advantages of both the DBN and the hierarchical architecture for capturing complex statistical patterns in speech while overcoming the inherent flaws of conventional hidden Markov models and multilayer layer perceptron. Experiments results on TIMIT database show that the proposed method can yield 2% improvement.

The robustness of MI is closely restricted by the choice of MI window sizes. For unsupervised human monitoring applications, obtaining appropriate MI window sizes for computing MI in videos with multiple people in different sizes and different levels of occlusion is problematic. In this work, we apply local self-similarity (LSS) as a dense multimodal similarity metric and show its adequacy and strengths compared to MI for a human ROIs registration. We also propose an LSS-based registration of thermal-visible stereo videos that addresses the problem of multiple people and occlusions in the scene. Our method improves the accuracy of the state-of-the-art disparity voting (DV) correspondence algorithm by proposing a motion segmentation step that approximates depth segments in an image and enables assigning disparity to each depth segment using larger matching window while keeping registration accuracy.

157,The outcomes of psychiatric inpatients by proportion of experienced psychiatrists and nurse staffing in hospital: New findings on improving the quality of mental health care in South Korea,"Kyu-Tae Han,Sun Jung Kim,Sung-In Jang,Myung-Il Hahm,Seung Ju Kim,Seo Yoon Lee,Eun-Cheol Park,Kyu-Tae Han,Sun Jung Kim,Sung-In Jang,Myung-Il Hahm,Seung Ju Kim,Seo Yoon Lee,Eun-Cheol Park","Readmission rates for mental health care are higher in South Korea than other Organization for Economic Development (OECD) countries. Therefore, it is worthwhile to continue investigating how to reduce readmissions. Taking a novel approach, we determined the relationship between psychiatrist experience and mental health care readmission rates. We used National Health Insurance claim data (N=21,315) from 81 hospitals to analyze readmissions within 30 days of discharge for ""mood disorders"" or ""schizophrenia, schizotypal and delusional disorders"" during 2010-2013. In this study, multilevel models that included both patient and hospital-level variables were analyzed to examine associations with readmission. Readmissions within 30 days of discharge accounted for 1079 (5.1%) claims. Multilevel analysis demonstrated that the proportion of experienced psychiatrists at a hospital was inversely associated with risk of readmission (OR: 0.79, 95% CI: 0.74-0.84 per 10% increase in experienced psychiatrists). Readmission rates for psychiatric disorders within 30 days of discharge were lower in hospitals with a higher number of nurses (OR: 0.95, 95% CI: 0.94-0.96 per 10 nurses). In conclusion, health policymakers and hospital managers should make an effort to reduce readmissions for psychiatric disorders and other diseases by considering the role that physician experience plays and nurse staffing.",Experienced physicians; Nurse staffing; Psychiatric disorders; Psychiatrists; Readmission.
158,KPAC: A Kernel-Based Parametric Active Contour Method for Fast Image Segmentation,"Mishra, Akshaya; Wong, Alexander","Object boundary detection has been a topic of keen interest to the signal processing and pattern recognition community. A popular approach for object boundary detection is parametric active contours. Existing parametric active contour approaches often suffer from slower convergence rates, difficulty dealing with complex high curvature boundaries, and are prone to being trapped in local optima in the presence of noise and background clutter. To address these problems, this paper proposes a novel kernel-based active contour (KPAC) approach, which replaces the conventional internal energy term used in existing approaches by incorporating an adaptive kernel derived for the underlying image characteristics. Experimental results demonstrate that the KPAC approach achieves state-of-the-art performance when compared to two other state-of-the-art parametric active contour approaches.",Boundary extraction; kernel; parametric active contour

We identified 56 articles involving patients with ALK-positive non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and brain metastases (BM) treated with ALK TKIs published between January 2000 and June 2021. In first-line settings, central nervous system response rates in clinical trials with alectinib (86-94%), brigatinib (67-78%), and lorlatinib (42-82%) were generally higher than those reported with crizotinib (16-71%). Median progression-free survival in patients receiving crizotinib (5.6-7.4 months) was lower than alectinib (not reached), brigatinib (24.0 months), and ceritinib (10.7-25.2 months). Across these counties, next-generation TKIs are preferred for patients with progressing BM lesions. Although next-generation ALK TKIs demonstrate significant activity in these patients and following progression on crizotinib, access remains a challenge for personalized therapy.",ALK TKIs; Anaplastic lymphoma kinase; Brain metastases; Non-small cell lung cancer.

From 75 cases of intramammary infections in dairy cows, 66 staphylococcal isolates were collected, including 11 Staphylococcus aureus isolates (17%) and 55 coagulase-negative staphylococci (83%). Sixty isolates (91%) formed strong biofilms. KRe had minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) and minimal bactericidal concentrations (MBC) against the isolates ranging 32-256 ug/mL and 64-512 ug/mL, respectively. Two-hour KRe exposures at 4×MIC, viabilities of S. aureus and S. haemolyticus decreased by 3 log10 compared to the control. Scanning EM (SEM) showed that KRe disrupted the bacterial cells of both species. KRe at 1/16×MIC significantly inhibited biofilm formation (P < 0.05) in both S. aureus and S. haemolyticus. At 1/2×MIC, S. aureus and S. haemolyticus biofilm inhibition ranged from 75 to 99%. Cells within established biofilms were disrupted 66-83% by KRe at 32×MIC. Moreover, 1/2×MIC KRe reduced bacterial adhesion to glass surfaces observed by SEM. According to GC-MS analysis, the major compound in KRe was endo-2-hydroxy-9,9-(ethylenedioxy)-1-carbethoxy bicyclo [3.3.1] nonane (E2N). Molecular docking analysis of E2N has a high affinity for staphylococcal accessory regulator A (SarA), binding free-energy - 6.40kcal/mol. The results suggested that KRe may have medicinal benefits by inhibiting the growth, biofilm, and adhesion of antibiotic resistant staphylococci isolated from bovine mastitis.",Biofilms; Bovine mastitis; Knema retusa extract; Staphylococci; Viability.

The method exploited the combination of mixed-mode weak anion exchange-reversed phase with a octadecyl stationary phase, separating PFASs according to ionic classes and chain length. To develop and optimize the LC × LC method we used a reference training set of twenty-four anionic PFASs, representing the main classes of compounds occurring in AFFFs and covering a wide range of physicochemical properties. In particular, we investigated different modulation approaches to reduce injection band broadening and breakthrough in the second dimension separation. Active solvent and stationary phase assisted modulations were compared, with the best results obtained with the last approach. In the optimal conditions, the predicted peak capacity corrected for undersampling was higher than three-hundred in a separation space of about 60 min. Subsequently, the developed method was applied to the non-targeted analysis of two AFFF samples for the identification of homologous series of PFASs, in which it was possible to identify up to thirty-nine potential compounds of interest utilizing Kendrick mass defect analysis. Even within the samples, the features considered potential PFAS by mass defect analysis elute in the chromatographic regions discriminating for the ionic group and/or the chain length, thus confirming the applicability of the method presented for the analysis of AFFF mixtures and, to a further extent, of environmental matrices affected by the AFFF.",Data processing; Feature detection; Mass defect; Modulation; Orthogonality; Peak capacity.

Some of the factors are embedded in the place. This paper takes Beijing Crosstalk as an example to explore its relationship with the place Beijing. The authors interviewed and surveyed the crosstalk performers, and analyzed data of crosstalk performers from the Sina Weibo social media platform. The study found that Beijing crosstalk can be particularly successful because there are three levels of social networks embedded in Beijing: The first is the mentor-apprentice relationship within the crosstalk group. The second is communication with other performing groups or performers (such as other crosstalk groups, performers from opera, drama, etc.) in Beijing. The third is their cooperating relationship with the media. These three networks are not available in any other cities of China, which is the key to the inheritance and development of Beijing crosstalk as intangible cultural heritage. Therefore, the protection and transmission of local intangible cultural heritage needs not only to protect the intangible cultural heritage itself, but also to protect its related social networks and social resources that make up such networks.",crosstalk; social network; place; performing arts; intangible cultural heritage
163,"Motion Segmentation in the Presence of Outlying, Incomplete, or Corrupted Trajectories","Rao, Shankar; Tron, Roberto; Vidal, Rene; Ma, Yi","In this paper, we study the problem of segmenting tracked feature point trajectories of multiple moving objects in an image sequence. Using the affine camera model, this problem can be cast as the problem of segmenting samples drawn from multiple linear subspaces. In practice, due to limitations of the tracker, occlusions, and the presence of nonrigid objects in the scene, the obtained motion trajectories may contain grossly mistracked features, missing entries, or corrupted entries. In this paper, we develop a robust subspace separation scheme that deals with these practical issues in a unified mathematical framework. Our methods draw strong connections between lossy compression, rank minimization, and sparse representation. We test our methods extensively on the Hopkins155 motion segmentation database and other motion sequences with outliers and missing data. We compare the performance of our methods to state-of-the-art motion segmentation methods based on expectation-maximization and spectral clustering. For data without outliers or missing information, the results of our methods are on par with the state-of-the-art results and, in many cases, exceed them. In addition, our methods give surprisingly good performance in the presence of the three types of pathological trajectories mentioned above.

Examples of recent natechs include catastrophic oil spills associated with Hurricane Katrina and hazardous chemical releases in Europe during the heavy floods of 2002. Natechs create difficult challenges for emergency responders due to the geographical extent of the natural disaster, the likelihood of simultaneous releases, emergency personnel being preoccupied with response to the natural disaster, mitigation measures failing due to the effects of the natural disaster, and others. Recovery from natechs may be much more difficult than for ""normal"" chemical accidents, as the economic and social conditions of the industrial facility and the surrounding community may have been drastically altered by the natural disaster. Potential safeguards against natechs include adoption of stricter design criteria, chemical process safeguards, community land use planning, disaster mitigation and response planning, and sustainable industrial processes, but these safeguards are only sporadically applied. Ultimately, the public must engage in a comprehensive discussion of acceptable risks for natechs.",natechs; chemical accidents; industrial accidents; hurricanes; Hurricane Katrina; mitigation; response
165,Extended Range Electric Vehicle With Driving Behavior Estimation in Energy Management,"Vatanparvar, Korosh; Faezi, Sina; Burago, Igor; Levorato, Marco; Al Faruque, Mohammad Abdullah","Battery and energy management methodologies have been proposed to address the design challenges of driving range and battery lifetime in electric vehicles (EVs). However, the driving behavior is a major factor which has been neglected in these methodologies. In this paper, we propose a novel context-aware methodology to estimate the driving behavior in terms of future vehicle speeds and integrate this capability into EV energy management. We implement a driving behavior model using a variation of artificial neural networks called nonlinear autoregressive model with eXogenous inputs (NARX). We train our novel context-aware NARX model based on historical behavior of real drivers, their recent driving reactions, and route average speed retrieved from Google Maps in order to enable driver-specific and self-adaptive driving behavior modeling and long-term estimation. We analyze the estimation error of our methodology and its impact on a battery lifetime-aware automotive climate control, comparing to the state-of-the-art methodologies for various estimation window sizes. Our methodology shows only 12% error for up to 30-s speed prediction which is an improvement of 27% compared to the state-of-the-art. Therefore, the higher accuracy helps the controller to achieve up to 82% of the maximum energy saving and battery lifetime improvement achievable in ideal methodology where the future vehicle speeds are known.",CPS; electric vehicle; battery; HVAC; energy management; statistical modeling; neural network; model predictive control; optimization

Women are more prone to obesity and binge eating than men but the neural causes of individual differences are unknown. In an animal model of hedonic eating, a prior study found that females were more susceptible than males to eat palatable food when sated and that the neuropeptide orexin/hypocretin (ORX) was crucial in both sexes. The current study examined potential extra-hypothalamic forebrain targets of ORX signaling during hedonic eating. We measured Fos induction in the cortical, thalamic, striatal, and amygdalar areas that receive substantial ORX inputs and contain their receptors in hungry and sated male and female rats during palatable (high-sucrose) food consumption. During the test, hungry rats of both sexes ate substantial amounts, and while sated males ate much less than hungry rats, sated females ate as much as hungry rats. The Fos induction analysis identified sex differences in recruitment of specific areas of the medial prefrontal cortex, paraventricular nucleus of the thalamus (PVT), nucleus accumbens (ACB), and central nucleus of the amygdala (CEA), and similar patterns across sexes in the insular cortex. There was a striking activation of the infralimbic cortex in sated males, who consumed the least amount food and unique correlations between the insular cortex, PVT, and CEA, as well as the prelimbic cortex, ACB, and CEA in sated females but not sated males. The study identified key functional circuits that may drive hedonic eating in a sex-specific manner.",Consumption; Hedonic; Orexin; Palatability; Sex differences.
167,Theoretical analysis of heat pump assisted air gap membrane distillation,"Bindels, Martijn; Nelemans, Bart","Three configurations for heat pumps for simultaneously heating and cooling of vacuum assisted air gap membrane distillation (V-AGMD) are proposed and theoretically analysed. The benefit of using heat pumps is that local heating is not needed. The first configuration is the current state of the art a heat pump is used for the heating and cooling of V-AGMD. In the second configuration, a heat pump is connected to a V-AGMD module where the membrane and condenser channel have a constant temperature. The second configuration has a total distillate production of 38251/m(2)/h, but has a specific electrical energy consumption (SEEC) ranging between 16 and 107 kWh(el)/m(3). The SEEC of the first configuration ranges between 9 and 22 kWh(el)/m(3), which is higher than the thermodynamic limit. In the third configuration, a zero liquid discharge setup was proposed based on the first configuration. Results indicate that 26.7 kWh(el)/m(3) is needed to raise the 35 g/l feed water to 250 g/l, which is only slightly higher than the 25 kWh(el)/m(3) of mechanical vapour compression.

Pre- and post-test measures of the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, Beck Depression Inventory-II, and remission rates were measured. The results indicate that patients treated with art psychotherapy and ongoing pharmacotherapy showed slightly greater improvement when compared with pharmacotherapy alone in moderate-to-severe MDD. These results suggest that art psychotherapy could be an effective add-on strategy for the treatment of moderate-to-severe MDD. However, a rigorous test would facilitate a better understanding of art psychotherapy as an add-on strategy for MDD treatment.",depression; major depressive disorder; art psychotherapy; combined therapy; antidepressants

Agricultural soil is becoming a primary sink for nanoplastics generated from plastic debris. The uptake and accumulation of nanoplastics by crops contaminate the food chain and pose unexpected risks to human health. However, whether nanoplastics can enter grains and their impact on the grains of crop grown in contaminated soil is still unknown. Here, the translocation of polystyrene nanoplastics (PS-NPs) in crops, including peanut (Arachis hypogaea L.) and rice (Oryza sativa L.) is investigated. It is demonstrated PS-NPs translocation from the root and accumulation in the grains at the maturation stage. The treatment with PS-NPs (250 mg kg-1 ) increases the empty-shell numbers of rice grain by 35.45%, thereby decreasing the seed-setting rate of rice by 3.02%, and also decreases the average seed weight of peanuts by 3.45%. Moreover, PS-NPs exerted adverse effects on nutritional quality, such as decreasing the content of mineral elements, amino acids, and unsaturated fatty acids.

170,TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS IN MAMMOGRAPHY,"Yaffe, Martin J.; Mainprize, James G.; Jong, Roberta A.","The art, science, and technology of mammography have developed steadily over the past 35 y. Mammography is a central tool for diagnosis of symptoms of breast cancer. In addition, periodic screening of asymptomatic women in certain age groups has been clearly demonstrated to contribute to reduction of mortality from breast cancer. Technical improvements have allowed the examination to be carried out at substantially lower radiation dose than was necessary to obtain a good image in the 1970's, while at the same time providing greatly improved contrast, spatial resolution, dynamic range and tissue coverage. Digital mammography overcomes many of the technical limitations inherent in screen-film mammography and has been shown to offer increased accuracy for women under 50 and those with dense breasts. The radiation risk associated with mammography cannot be ignored, however, modern analysis suggests that it is very low, especially compared to the benefits from the exam. Nevertheless, imaging should be conducted with careful attention to efficient use of the radiation.

Primary care, an essential provider of mental health services, rapidly adopted telemedicine to address behavioral health needs. Here we examine the provision of mental health services by primary care during the pandemic, including the essential use of telemedicine. METHODS: Data were collected via a series of national, cross-sectional surveys of primary care clinicians in November 2020 by the Larry A. Green Center. The survey was distributed through a network of partner organizations and subscribers. Descriptive and chi squared analysis were utilized. RESULTS: Among 1,472 respondents, 88% reported increased mental health needs and 37% reported higher rates of substance use among patients. Most (65%) clinicians became more involved in providing mental health support, and 64% reported using telemedicine to provide behavioral health services. Phone-based care was more common for care delivery among patients who were uninsured (60% vs 42%, P < .01), Medicare beneficiaries (45% vs 36%, P < .05), non-English speaking (67% vs 40%, P < .001), and racial and ethnic minorities (58% vs 34%, P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: Primary care is a leading provider of mental health services and has played a critical role during the pandemic. Primary care clinicians have strong relationships with their patients as well as outreach within communities that may otherwise struggle to access mental health services. The use of telemedicine in primary care, and specifically phone-based services, has been an essential tool to providing equitable access to mental health services.",COVID-19; Cross-Sectional Studies; Family Medicine; Health Services Accessibility; Mental Health Services; Pandemics; Primary Health Care; Surveys and Questionnaires; Telemedicine.

173,Protection Efficacy of Monoclonal Antibodies Targeting Different Regions of Specific SzM Protein from Swine-Isolated Streptococcus equi ssp. zooepidemicus Strains,"Haoshuai Song,Chen Yuan,Yu Zhang,Fei Pan,Hongjie Fan,Zhe Ma,Haoshuai Song,Chen Yuan,Yu Zhang,Fei Pan,Hongjie Fan,Zhe Ma","Streptococcus equi subsp. zooepidemicus (SEZ) has a wide host spectrum, including humans and domestic animals. The SEZ-caused swine streptococcicosis outbreak has occurred in several countries, and the swine-isolated strains usually have specific S. zooepidemicus M-like (szm) gene types. In this study, we found that the production of this specific szm gene (SzM protein) was an effective vaccine candidate. It could provide better protection with a 7-day interval immune procedure than the traditional vaccine strain ST171 and attenuate the strain ΔsezV against swine-isolated hypervirulent SEZ infections. According to this outcome, we developed monoclonal antibodies (McAbs) targeting the variable and conserved regions of this SzM protein, respectively. These McAbs all belong to the IgG1 isotype with a κ type light chain and have opsonophagocytic activity rather than agglutination or complement activation functions. We estimated the protection efficiency of the McAbs with 3 different passive immunotherapy programs. The anti-conserved region McAb can provide effective protection against swine-isolated SEZ infections with only the inconvenient immunotherapy program. It also partially works in preventing infection by other SEZ strains. In contrast, the anti-variable region McAb is only adapted to protect the host against a specific szm type SEZ strain isolated from pigs, but it is flexible for different immunotherapy programs. These data provide further information to guide the development of derived, genetically engineered McAbs that have potential applications in protecting hosts against swine-isolated, hypervirulent SEZ infections in the future. IMPORTANCE The swine-isolated SEZ, with its specific szm gene sequence, has impacted the pig feeding industry in China and North America and has led to serious economic loss. Though the SzM protein of SEZ has been proven to be an effective vaccine in preventing infection, most previous studies focused on horse-isolated strains, which have different szm gene types compared to swine-isolated strains. In this study, we developed the McAbs targeting the conserved and variable regions of this SzM protein from the swine-isolated hypervirulent strains and evaluated their protection efficiency. Our research provided information for the development of chimeric McAbs or other genetically engineered McAbs that have potential applications in protecting pigs against hypervirulent SEZ infections in the future.",Streptococcus equi subsp. zooepidemicus; SzM protein; immunotherapy; monoclonal antibody; swine streptococcicosis.

Additionally, we propose two improvements to increase the classification accuracy of Modular-CNN. The first improvement combines the power of raw and normalised features, while the second one concerns the Euler transformation of feature vectors.

Despite the availability of treatments (antitoxin and antimicrobials) and effective vaccines, the disease still occurs sporadically in low-income countries and in higher income where use of diphtheria vaccine is inconsistent. Diphtheria was highly endemic in Vietnam in the 1990s; here, we aimed to provide some historical context to the circulation of erythromycin resistant organisms in Vietnam during this period. After recovering 54 C. diphtheriae isolated from clinical cases of diphtheria in Ho Chi Minh City between 1992 and 1998 we conducted whole genome sequencing and analysis. Our data outlined substantial genetic diversity among the isolates, illustrated by seven distinct Sequence Types (STs), but punctuated by the sustained circulation of ST67 and ST209. With the exception of one isolate, all sequences contained the tox gene, which was classically located on a corynebacteriophage. All erythromycin resistant isolates, accounting for 13 % of organisms in this study, harboured a novel 18 kb erm(X)-carrying plasmid, which exhibited limited sequence homology to previously described resistance plasmids in C. diphtheriae.

However, efficiencies of single and simple Fe-based MOFs still undergo restricted light absorption and weak charge separation. Assembly of different iron-based MOF building blocks into a hybrid MOF@MOF heterostructure reactor could be an encouraging strategy for the effective capture of antibiotics from the aqueous phase. This paper reports a new-style MIL-101(Fe)@MIL-100(Fe) photocatalyst, which was groundbreakingly constructed to realize a double win for boosting the performances of adsorption and photocatalysis. The optical response range, surface open sites, and charge separation efficiency of MIL-101(Fe)@MIL-100(Fe) can be regulated through accurate design and alteration. Attributed to the synergistic effects of double iron-based MOFs, MIL-101(Fe)@MIL-100(Fe) exhibits an excellent photocatalytic activity toward TC degradability compared to MIL-101(Fe) and MIL-100(Fe), which is even superior to those reported previously in the literature. Furthermore, the main active species of •O2- and h+ were proved through trapping tests of the photocatalytic process. Additionally, MIL-101(Fe)@MIL-100(Fe) possesses remarkable stability, maintaining more than 90% initial photocatalytic activity after the fifth cycle. In brief, MIL-101(Fe)@MIL-100(Fe) was highly efficient for TC degradation.

So, this calls out for the modication of the conventional pre-quantum RSA algorithm into a secure post-quantum cryptographic-based RSA technique. In this research, we propose a post-quantum lattice-based RSA (LB-RSA) for IoT-based cloud applications to secure the shared data and information. The proposed work is validated by implementing it in 60-dimensions. The key size is about 1:152 105-bits and generation time is 0:8 hours. Furthermore, it has been tested with AVISPA, which conrms security in the presence of an intruder. Moreover, the proposed LB-RSA technique is compared with the existing state-of-the-art techniques. The empirical results advocate that the proposed lattice-based variant is not only safe but beats counterparts in terms of secured data sharing.",Quantum computing; Lattices; Computer security; Encryption; Protocols; Lattice-based cryptography; LB-RSA; post-quantum cryptography; IoT application; Gauss-sieve algorithm
180,A general method for calculating power for GEE analysis of complete and incomplete stepped wedge cluster randomized trials,"Ying Zhang,John S Preisser,Elizabeth L Turner,Paul J Rathouz,Mark Toles,Fan Li,Ying Zhang,John S Preisser,Elizabeth L Turner,Paul J Rathouz,Mark Toles,Fan Li","Stepped wedge designs have uni-directional crossovers at randomly assigned time points (steps) where clusters switch from control to intervention condition. Incomplete stepped wedge designs are increasingly used in cluster randomized trials of health care interventions and have periods without data collection due to logistical, resource and patient-centered considerations. The development of sample size formulae for stepped wedge trials has primarily focused on complete designs and continuous responses. Addressing this gap, a general, fast, non-simulation based power procedure is proposed for generalized estimating equations analysis of complete and incomplete stepped wedge designs and its predicted power is compared to simulated power for binary and continuous responses. An extensive set of simulations for six and twelve clusters is based upon the Connect-Home trial with an incomplete stepped wedge design. Results show that empirical test size is well controlled using a t-test with bias-corrected sandwich variance estimator for as few as six clusters. Analytical power agrees well with a simulated power in scenarios with twelve clusters. For six clusters, analytical power is similar to simulated power with estimation using the correctly specified model-based variance estimator. To explore the impact of study design choice on power, the proposed fast GEE power method is applied to the Connect-Home trial design, four alternative incomplete stepped wedge designs and one complete design.",Correlated binary outcomes; correlation decay; finite-sample correction; group randomized trial; intraclass correlation.
181,Blockchain-Based Decentralized Model Aggregation for Cross-Silo Federated Learning in Industry 4.0,"Ranathunga, Tharindu; McGibney, Alan; Rea, Susan; Bharti, Sourabh","Traditional federated learning (FL) adopts a client-server architecture where FL clients (e.g., IoT edge devices) train a common global model with the help of a centralized orchestrator (cloud server). However, current approaches are moving away from centralized orchestration toward a decentralized one in order to fully adapt FL for a cross-silo configuration with multiple organizations acting as clients. State-of-the-art decentralized FL mechanisms make at least one of the following assumptions: 1) clients are trusted organizations and cannot inject low-quality model updates for aggregation and 2) client local models can be shared with other clients or a third party for verification of low-quality updates. This article proposes a Blockchain-based decentralized framework for scenarios where participatory organizations are believed to be fully capable of injecting low-quality model updates as they are not willing to expose their local models to any other entity for verification purpose. The proposed decentralized FL framework adopts a novel hierarchical network of aggregators with the ability to punish/reward organizations in proportion to their local model quality updates. The framework is flexible and unlike state-of-the-art solutions, prevents a single entity from possessing the aggregated model in any FL round of training. The proposed framework is tested with respect to off-chain and on-chain performance in two Industry 4.0 use cases: 1) predictive maintenance and 2) product visual inspection. A comparative evaluation against the state-of-the-art reveals the proposed framework's utility in terms of minimizing model convergence time and latency while maximizing accuracy and throughput.",Data models; Blockchains; Training; Computational modeling; Servers; Predictive models; Fourth Industrial Revolution; Blockchain; federated learning (FL); industry 4.0
182,Concatenated and Connected Random Forests With Multiscale Patch Driven Active Contour Model for Automated Brain Tumor Segmentation of MR Images,"Ma, Chao; Luo, Gongning; Wang, Kuanquan","Segmentation of brain tumors from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data sets is of great importance for improved diagnosis, growth rate prediction, and treatment planning. However, automating this process is challenging due to the presence of severe partial volume effect and considerable variability in tumor structures, as well as imaging conditions, especially for the gliomas. In this paper, we introduce a new methodology that combines random forests and active contour model for the automated segmentation of the gliomas from multimodal volumetric MR images. Specifically, we employ a feature representations learning strategy to effectively explore both local and contextual information from multimodal images for tissue segmentation by using modality specific random forests as the feature learning kernels. Different levels of the structural information is subsequently integrated into concatenated and connected random forests for gliomas structure inferring. Finally, a novel multiscale patch driven active contour model is exploited to refine the inferred structure by taking advantage of sparse representation techniques. Results reported on public benchmarks reveal that our architecture achieves competitive accuracy compared to the state-of-the-art brain tumor segmentation methods while being computationally efficient.",Magenetic resonance imaging; brain tumor; brain tumor segmentation; random forests; active contour model; multiscale patch

It surveys, structures, and deduplicates the measures used to compare both segmentation results and object proposals with a ground truth database; and proposes a new measure: the precision-recall for objects and parts. To compare the quality of these measures, eight state-of-the-art object proposal techniques are analyzed and two quantitative meta-measures involving nine state of the art segmentation methods are presented. The meta-measures consist in assuming some plausible hypotheses about the results and assessing how well each measure reflects these hypotheses. As a conclusion of the performed experiments, this paper proposes the tandem of precision-recall curves for boundaries and for objects-and-parts as the tool of choice for the supervised evaluation of image segmentation. We make the datasets and code of all the measures publicly available.",Image segmentation; object proposals; supervised evaluation; meta-measures

Two strategies were adopted to increase the concentration of oxygen vacancies favoring the hydration reaction to introduce protons. One was increasing the cation ratio between Yb and Nb over unity, the other was doping divalent alkaline earth elements to replace trivalent La. Proton conduction was evidenced by confirming the proton incorporation and H/D isotope effect in electrical conductivity. Doping Ca, Sr, and Ba further promoted the proton conduction. The results of crystal structure refinement indicated that the extrinsically introduced oxygen vacancies by the two strategies were accommodated in the tetrahedra (48 f) containing two La and two Yb/Nb cations, while the tetrahedra containing four La cations (8a) were fully occupied by oxide ions. A discussion was thereby performed, leading to the suggestion that not all the tetrahedra in the cubic pyrochlore structure of (La1-x Mx )2 (Nb0.45 Yb0.55 )2 O7-δ helped in incorporating and conducting protons, and only the oxygen vacancies surrounded by four Y cations (48 f site) or two La and two Y cations (8b site) were hydratable. It is thereby suggested that to enhance the proton conduction in pyrochlore oxides, an effective strategy might be tuning the ability of hydration or protonation of the tetrahedra to increase the proton concentration and expand the route for proton conduction.",conducting materials; hydration; oxygen vacancies; proton conductor; pyrochlore structure.

To overcome resistance to radiotherapy, we have developed a bioactive and CD44 targeted hyaluronic acid nanoparticle encapsulated with an NOX inhibitor, GKT831 (HANP/GKT831). We found that HANP/GKT831 had stronger inhibitory effects on ROS generation and cell proliferation than that of GKT831 alone in cancer cells. Systemic delivery of HANP/GKT831 led to the targeted accumulation in breast cancer patient derived xenograft (PDX) tumors in nude mice. Importantly, the combination of systemic delivery of HANP/GKT831 with a low dose of local radiotherapy significantly enhanced tumor growth inhibition in breast cancer PDX models. Our results showed that HANP/GKT831 primed tumor cells to radiation-induced DNA damage and cell death by downregulation of DNA repair function and oncogenic signal pathways.",GKT831; NADPH oxidases; Redox imbalance; hyaluronic acid nanoparticle (HANP); radiotherapy resistance; reactive oxygen species; targeted cancer therapy.

Existing optical character recognition engines cannot perform well in the natural scene. In this context, deep learning models have emerged as a powerful state-of-the-art technique in the classification and recognition process. This study proposes a new Convolutional Neural Network based system for scene text reading. We investigate how to combine the character recognition module followed by the word recognition module to achieve the overall system goal. The first module analyzes characters within multi-scale images by relaying on the power of the convolutional network and the fully connected network for character recognition. The second module relies on the Viterbi search to find the closest word to a given characters sequence. For the sake of more precision, a bigram based linguistic module is applied. The proposed system achieves the state-of-the-art performance on three standard scene text recognition benchmarks: chars74k, ICDAR 2003 and ICDAR 2013. In particular, this performance is proven on both of character and word recognition accuracy as well as speed aspects via a comparative study between different deep learning architectures.",Scene text; Text recognition; Deep learning; Linguistic verification

Recently, methods based on range and RGB-D data have shown promising results with relatively high recognition rates and fast running times. On this line, this paper presents a feature-based method for 6D pose estimation of rigid objects based on the Point Pair Features voting approach. The presented solution combines a novel preprocessing step, which takes into consideration the discriminative value of surface information, with an improved matching method for Point Pair Features. In addition, an improved clustering step and a novel view-dependent re-scoring process are proposed alongside two scene consistency verification steps. The proposed method performance is evaluated against 15 state-of-the-art solutions on a set of extensive and variate publicly available datasets with real-world scenarios under clutter and occlusion. The presented results show that the proposed method outperforms all tested state-of-the-art methods for all datasets with an overall 6.6% relative improvement compared to the second best method.",computer vision; range data; 6D pose estimation; 3D object recognition; scene understanding; model-based vision

In recent years, with the dramatic advance of high-throughput scanning and deep learning technology, automatic analysis of histology from whole-slide images has received a wealth of interest in the field of medical image computing, which aims to alleviate pathologists' workload and simultaneously reduce misdiagnosis rate. However, the automatic detection of lymph node metastases from whole-slide images remains a key challenge because such images are typically very large, where they can often be multiple gigabytes in size. Also, the presence of hard mimics may result in a large number of false positives. In this paper, we propose a novel method with anchor layers for model conversion, which not only leverages the efficiency of fully convolutional architectures to meet the speed requirement in clinical practice but also densely scans the whole-slide image to achieve accurate predictions on both micro- and macro-metastases. Incorporating the strategies of asynchronous sample prefetching and hard negative mining, the network can be effectively trained. The efficacy of our method is corroborated on the benchmark dataset of 2016 Camelyon Grand Challenge. Our method achieved significant improvements in comparison with the state-of-the-art methods on tumor localization accuracy with a much faster speed and even surpassed human performance on both challenge tasks.",Histopathology image analysis; computational pathology; whole-slide image; deep learning; metastasis detection

Although the frequency of these procedures is on the rise, a complete safety profile has yet to be established. The goal of our study is to analyze the trends and outcomes of these surgical procedures. Methods: All patients with a primary diagnosis of gender dysphoria undergoing GAS were identified from the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (ACS NSQIP) database between the years 2009 and 2018. Patient demographics and 30-day postoperative outcomes were recorded. We performed a multivariate logistic regression for postoperative complications, controlling for several confounding variables. Results: We identified 2956 patients, of which 1767 (59.78%) were transgender men and 1189 (40.22%) were transgender women. The number of patients undergoing GAS per year increased from 7 in 2010 to 1069 in 2018, a 152-fold increase. For patients undergoing top surgery, Black race (odds ratio [OR] = 2.255, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.189-4.277, p = 0.013) and diabetes (OR = 4.156, 95% CI 1.571-10.999, p = 0.004) were independent predictors of 30-day postoperative complications. For patients undergoing bottom surgery, total operative time in minutes (OR = 1.005, 95% CI 1.003-1.007, p = 0.001) was an independent predictor of 30-day postoperative complications. Conclusion: The demand for GAS has increased exponentially since 2014. While postoperative complication rates are acceptable, Black race was shown to be an independent predictor of postoperative morbidity in patients undergoing top surgery, a finding that calls for further investigation of racial disparities among transgender patients.",gender dysphoria; gender-affirming surgery; reconstructive surgery; transgender.

The hydrochar characterization revealed that it can provide attachment for microbial growth, and abundant surface functional groups (such as C-O, CO, C-OH, and C-N) for adsorption. Direct interspecies electron transfer (DIET) mediated by surface oxygen-containing functional groups on hydrochar increased the methane yield. The experimental group added with hydrochar and biogas slurry reflux had the highest methane and biogas production (34.40% and 36.98% higher than the control group, respectively). Results demonstrate hydrochar and biogas slurry reflux can improve microorganism species richness in anaerobic digestion systems, in which hydrochar can also improve microorganism species uniformity. Distance-based redundancy analysis showed that the VFAs, and pH had the greatest effects on the composition of the microbial community. The dominant microorganism at the phylum level in AD system were Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, and Proteobacteria. The addition of hydrochar and biogas slurry reflux can significantly increase the species abundance of Methanobacterium. These results indicate that the addition of hydrochar and biogas slurry reflux can improve the corresponding microbial abundance, in which hydrochar can enhance the redox characteristics and DIET between microorganism, biogas slurry reflux can also increase nutrient content of anaerobic digestion system, and collectively promote the methane yield.",Anaerobic digestion; Biogas slurry; Corn straw; Cow manure; Hydrochar; Microbial community.
191,Pollen forecasts in complex topography: two case studies from the Alps using the numerical pollen forecast model COSMO-ART,"Pauling, Andreas; Clot, Bernard; Menzel, Annette; Jung, Stephan","Pollen concentrations on Alpine mountain tops are poorly known due to few observations and few modeling studies. We present two case studies from the Alps that provide insights into the spatial and temporal distribution of birch pollen. The numerical pollen dispersion model COSMO-ART (COnsortium for Small-scale MOdelling-Aerosols and Reactive Trace gases) was used to simulate the birch pollen transport during the 2017 pollen season. The model configuration included 1.1-km horizontal grid spacing and 80 vertical levels. The simulations were compared with daily pollen concentrations from two mountain tops in the Alps (Weissfluhjoch near Davos, Switzerland, at 2692 m and Schneefernerhaus, Germany, at 2650 m a.s.l.). In addition, the Swiss pollen stations at Davos (1587 m a.s.l.) and Buchs (446 m a.s.l.) were used. COSMO-ART simulations agreed well with the observations at Davos and Weissfluhjoch. At the Environmental Research Station Schneefernerhaus, the pollen concentrations were generally overestimated. We analyzed the pollen transport episode of 9 April 2017 at Weissfluhjoch in more detail using vertical cross sections of the COSMO-ART simulations. The results suggest that pollen can be lifted up to 3000 m in the morning hours and are subsequently transported by large-scale winds leading to higher birch pollen concentrations at Weissfluhjoch than at Davos. This suggests that the actual situation regarding sources, topography and wind determines the pollen distribution and not only altitude. Still, pollen levels at Weissfluhjoch are more than one order of magnitude lower than typical pollen levels at lowland Swiss stations such as Buchs.",High-resolution pollen forecasts; COSMO-ART; Complex topography; Birch pollen; Pollen dispersion models; Pollen transport
192,The APISSER Methodology for Systematic Literature Reviews in Engineering,"Castillo, Stefanie; Grbovic, Petar","[Background] Every research topic is first to be addressed by understanding its current state of the art. A systematic literature review is a trustworthy method for establishing the published state of the art of any given topic. In engineering sciences, we have failed to consistently, methodologically, and thoroughly execute systematic literature reviews at the beginning of every research path, and to standardize the method to do so. Currently available methodologies fail to link a method to a customized and much-needed tool support. If the high-effort demanding task of executing a systematic literature review is not well tool-supported, it will soon become manually unmanageable to handle the large amount of data involved. [Objective] Therefore, we want to take a step forward towards standardizing the methodology for executing systematic literature reviews in engineering by proposing a tool-supported and task-oriented engineering flow methodology to execute systematic literature reviews in engineering. [Method] Based on the well-known and proven Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) methodology from medical sciences, we adapted and enhanced the method to follow a task-oriented engineering flow and to be supported by customized tools. [Results] In this paper, we first present the APISSER methodology for systematic literature reviews in engineering, and then show its practical application in a case study. [Conclusion] We have shown how the method successfully results in the collection of valid literature to report a trustworthy published state of the art in engineering sciences.",Bibliographies; Systematics; Task analysis; Data mining; Patents; Medical services; Soft sensors; Engineering method; PRISMA; systematic literature review; state of the art

In mammals, PGCs are specified early during embryonic development, at the boundary between embryonic and extraembryonic tissue, long before their later residences, the gonads, have developed. Despite the differences in form and behaviour when differentiated into oocytes or sperm cells, in the period between specification and gonadal colonization, male and female PGCs are morphologically indistinct and largely regulated by similar mechanisms. Here, we compare different modes and mechanisms that lead to the formation of PGCs, putting in context protocols that are in place to differentiate both human and mouse pluripotent stem cells into PGC-like cells. In addition, we review important aspects of the migration of PGCs to the gonadal ridges, where they undergo further sex-specific differentiation. Defects in migration need to be effectively corrected, as misplaced PGCs can become tumorigenic. Concluding, a combination of in vivo studies and the development of adequate innovative in vitro models, ensuring both robustness and standardization, are providing us with the tools for a greater understanding of the first steps of gametogenesis and to develop disease models to study the origin of germ cell tumours.

Not much effort, however, has been devoted to utilize symmetry information for graph matching. In this paper, we propose a new framework for symmetry-aware graph matching in the context of image matching. In the framework, we first define symmetry matrices to characterize the geometric symmetry relation among image features, and then develop two methods to discover such symmetry. After that we design general strategies to boost graph matching algorithms with symmetry constraints, and apply these strategies to several state-of-the-art algorithms. For evaluation, the proposed symmetry-aware graph matching algorithms are first applied to two datasets involving clear symmetry patterns: a recently proposed architecture image set and a dental panoramic radiograph collection. The results clearly demonstrate the benefits of using symmetry information. An experiment is also conducted on a dataset where symmetry is less obvious, the results show that our strategies still achieve better of similar performance compared with state-of-the-arts.

196,Facial expression recognition through adaptive learning of local motion descriptor,"Agarwal, Swapna; Mukherjee, Dipti Prasad","A novel bag-of-words based approach is proposed for recognizing facial expressions corresponding to each of the six basic prototypic emotions from a video sequence. Each video sequence is represented as a specific combination of local (in spatio-temporal scale) motion patterns. These local motion patterns are captured in motion descriptors (MDs) which are unique combinations of optical flow and image gradient. These MDs can be compared to the words in the bag-of-words setting. Generally, the key-words in the wordbook as reported in the literature, are rigid, i.e., are taken as it is from the training data and cannot generalize well. We propose a novel adaptive learning technique for the key-words. The adapted key-MDs better represent the local motion patterns of the videos and generalize well to the unseen data and thus give better expression recognition accuracy. To test the efficiency of the proposed approach, we have experimented extensively on three well known datasets. We have also compared the results with existing state-of-the-art expression descriptors. Our method gives better accuracy. The proposed approach have been able to reduce the training time including the time for feature-extraction more than nine times and test time more than twice as compared to current state-of-the-art descriptor.",Facial expression recognition; Motion descriptor; Expression descriptor; Bag-of-words; Adaptive learning

We provide a new analysis of the original algorithm to derive our own accelerated version, and prove that our algorithm is guaranteed to converge to a stationary point of the reweighted nuclear norm minimization problem. Numerical results show that our algorithm requires distinctly fewer iterations and less computational time than the original one to achieve the same (or very close) accuracy, in some problem instances even require only about 50% computational time of the original one, and is also notably faster than several other state-of-the-art algorithms.

200,DARN: Distance Attention Residual Network for Lightweight Remote-Sensing Image Superresolution,"Wang, Qingjian; Wang, Sen; Chen, Mingfang; Zhu, Yang","The application of single-image superresolution (SISR) in remote sensing is of great significance. Although the state-of-the-art convolution neural network (CNN)-based SISR methods have achieved excellent results, the large model and slow speed make it difficult to deploy in real remote sensing tasks. In this article, we propose a compact and efficient distance attention residual network (DARN) to achieve a better compromise between model accuracy and complexity. The distance attention residual connection block (DARCB), the core component of the DARN, uses multistage feature aggregation to learn more accurate feature representations. The main branch of the DARCB adopts a shallow residual block (SRB) to flexibly learn residual information to ensure the robustness of the model. We also propose a distance attention block (DAB) as a bridge between the main branch and the branch of the DARCB; the DAB can effectively alleviate the loss of detail features in the deep CNN extraction process. Experimental results on two remote sensing and five super-resolution benchmark datasets demonstrate that the DARN achieves a better compromise than existing methods in terms of performance and model complexity. In addition, the DARN achieves the optimal solution compared with the state-of-the-art lightweight remote sensing SISR method in terms of parameter amount, computation amount, and inference speed.

However, there was unclear evidence about its effects on oxidative stress and DNA damage in earthworms. In this study, earthworms were cultivated in various doses of MTBE (0.0 mg/kg, 10.0 mg/kg, 30.0 mg/kg, and 60.0 mg/kg) contaminated agricultural soil for 7 days, 14 days, 21 days, and 28 days, respectively. The result showed that the reactive oxygen species (ROS) content of earthworms significantly increased in MTBE treatment groups compared to the control group. In MTBE treatment groups, the activities of superoxide dismutase, catalase, peroxidase, and glutathione S-transferase were significantly activated at the exposure of 7 days, which increased by 36.3-78.9%, 51.8-97.3%, 36.5-61.9%, and 12.0-54.8%, respectively. Then, the activities of these defense enzymes showed various changes following the changes in exposure times and MTBE concentrations. Especially in the 60.0 mg kg-1 group, both antioxidant enzymes and GST were still significantly activated at the exposure of 14 days and then significantly inhibited at the exposure of 28 days. The analysis of olive tail moment showed significant DNA damage in the 10.0 mg kg-1 group at the exposure of 28 days, and this damage in 30.0 mg/kg and 60.0 mg/kg groups was found at the exposure of 7 days. This result was consistent with the malondialdehyde accumulation in earthworms. Additionally, the analysis of IBRv2 showed the effects of MTBE treatments on earthworms in dose- and time-dependent manners.

202,A critical review on microbial ecology in the novel biological nitrogen removal process: Dynamic balance of complex functional microbes for nitrogen removal,"Hong Chen,Ke Liu,Enzhe Yang,Jing Chen,Yanling Gu,Sha Wu,Min Yang,Hong Wang,Dongbo Wang,Hailong Li,Hong Chen,Ke Liu,Enzhe Yang,Jing Chen,Yanling Gu,Sha Wu,Min Yang,Hong Wang,Dongbo Wang,Hailong Li","The novel biological nitrogen removal process has been extensively studied for its high nitrogen removal efficiency, energy efficiency, and greenness. A successful novel biological nitrogen removal process has a stable microecological equilibrium and benign interactions between the various functional bacteria. However, changes in the external environment can easily disrupt the dynamic balance of the microecology and affect the activity of functional bacteria in the novel biological nitrogen removal process. Therefore, this review focuses on the microecology in existing the novel biological nitrogen removal process, including the growth characteristics of functional microorganisms and their interactions, together with the effects of different influencing factors on the evolution of microbial communities. This provides ideas for achieving a stable dynamic balance of the microecology in a novel biological nitrogen removal process. Furthermore, to investigate deeply the mechanisms of microbial interactions in novel biological nitrogen removal process, this review also focuses on the influence of quorum sensing (QS) systems on nitrogen removal microbes, regulated by which bacteria secrete acyl homoserine lactones (AHLs) as signaling molecules to regulate microbial ecology in the novel biological nitrogen removal process. However, the mechanisms of action of AHLs on the regulation of functional bacteria have not been fully determined and the composition of QS system circuits requires further investigation. Meanwhile, it is necessary to further apply molecular analysis techniques and the theory of systems ecology in the future to enhance the exploration of microbial species and ecological niches, providing a deeper scientific basis for the development of a novel biological nitrogen removal process.",Artificial ecosystems; Carbon reduction technologies; Competitive dynamics; Quorum sensing; Wastewater treatment.
203,Spectral Image Processing for Museum Lighting Using CIE LED Illuminants,"Angel Martinez-Domingo, Miguel; Melgosa, Manuel; Okajima, Katsunori; Jesus Medina, Victor; Jose Collado-Montero, Francisco","This work presents a spectral color-imaging procedure for the detailed colorimetric study of real artworks under arbitrary illuminants. The results demonstrate this approach to be a powerful tool for art and heritage professionals when deciding which illumination to use in museums, or which conservation or restoration techniques best maintain the color appearance of the original piece under any illuminant. Spectral imaging technology overcomes the limitations of common area-based point-measurement devices such as spectrophotometers, allowing a local study either pixelwise or by selected areas. To our knowledge, this is the first study available that uses the proposed CIE (Commission Internationale de l'Eclairage) light-emitting diode (LED) illuminants in the context of art and heritage science, comparing them with the three main CIE illuminants A, D50, and D65. For this, the corresponding colors under D65 have been calculated using a chromatic adaptation transform analogous to the one in CIECAM02. For the sample studied, the CIE LED illuminants with the lowest average CIEDE2000 color differences from the standard CIE illuminants are LED-V1 for A and LED-V2 for D50 and D65, with 1.23, 1.07, and 1.57 units, respectively. The work studied is a Moorish epigraphic frieze of plasterwork with a tiled skirting from the Nasrid period (12th-15th centuries) exhibited in the Museum of the Alhambra (Granada, Spain).",spectral imaging; colorimetry; hyperspectral line scanner; CIE illuminants; CIEDE2000

This study compared four bulking agents: mushroom residue (MR), MR + primary BM (BM-P), BM-P, and secondary BM (BM-S). The effect mechanism of back mixing (BM) inoculation was assessed based on biodrying performance and microbial community succession. Four trials (Trial A, Trial B, Trial C, and Trial D) reached maximum temperatures of 61.9, 68.8, 73.7, and 69.9 °C on days 6, 3, 2, and 2, respectively. Application of BM increased pile warming rate and resulted in higher temperatures. Temperature changes and microbial competition lead to decline in microbial diversity and richness during the biodrying process. Microbial diversity increased of four biodried products. The number of microorganisms shared by Trial A, Trial B, Trial C, and Trial D were 90, 119, 224, and 300, respectively. The addition of BM improved microbial community stability, and facilitating the initiation of biodrying process. Microbial genera that played an important role in the biodrying process included Ureibacillus, Bacillus, Sphaerobacter, and Tepidimicrobium. Based on these results, it was concluded that BM was efficient method to enhanced the microbial activity and reduced the usage of bulking agent.",Back mixing; Biodrying; Effect mechanism; Microbial succession; Sewage sludge.

In recent years, many museums, artwork galleries, and even art exhibitions demonstrated dynamic artworks for visitors to relish. The most famous dynamic artwork is ""The moving painting of Along the River During the Qingming Festival"". Nevertheless, it took 2 years to complete this work. They had to plan each action for every character at first, then drew each video frame by animators. Finally, it could achieve seamless stitching by using lots of projectors to render scene on the screen. In our research, we develop a method for generating animated paintings. It only needs a number of videos on a network of existing databases and requires users to perform some simple auxiliary operations to achieve the effect of animation synthesis. First, our system lets users select an object with the same class from the first video frame. We then employ random forests as learning algorithm to retrieve from a video the object which users want to insert into an artwork. Second, we utilize style transferring, which enables the video frames to be consistent with the style of painting. At last, we use the seamless image cloning algorithm to yield seamless synthesizing result. Our approach allows different users to synthesize animating paintings up to their selected styled video frames. The resulting work not only maintains the original author's painting style, but also generates a variety of artistic conception for people to enjoy.",Visual arts; Animation synthesis; Style transfer; Non-photorealistic rendering (NPR)

We observed good multivariate discrimination between the metabolomic and lipoproteomic profiles of subjects with positive and negative Rh. In contrast, we did not observe significant discrimination for the ABO blood group pairwise comparisons, suggesting only slight metabolic differences between these group-specific metabolic profiles. We report univariate associations (P-value < 0.05) between the subfraction HDL1 related to Apo A1, the subfraction HDL2 related to cholesterol and phospholipids, and the particle number of LDL2 related to free cholesterol, cholesterol, phospholipids, and Apo B and the ABO blood groups; we observed association of the lipid main fraction LDL4 related to free cholesterol, triglycerides, and Apo B; creatine; the particle number of LDL5; the subfraction LDL5 related to Apo B; the particle number of LDL4; and the subfraction LDL4 related to Apo B with Rh blood factors.

This present investigation deals with the development of a non-invasive soft sensor by utilizing metabolic heat rate as input signal for online estimation of specific growth rate (μest) during the induction phase of glycoengineered Pichia pastoris for human interferon-alpha 2b (huIFNα2b) production. Feedforward strategy employing a predetermined exponential feeding of methanol during the induction phase was dealt at defined setpoint values (μSP). Standard PID controller with predetermined gain values regulated methanol feeding in accordance with the deviation from the μSP value. An adaptive PID (gain scheduling) significantly minimized the deviation of μ from its μSP value, reduced the amplitude of oscillation and achieved long-term controller stability. Robust control of methanol feeding by adaptive PID resulted in a 1.5 and 2.2-fold increase in productivity of huIFNα2b compared to standard PID and feedforward controls respectively. Moreover, adaptive PID control facilitated narrow range control of μ for longer durations (> 20 h) with a low average tracking error (< 6%) enumerating its scope of application in therapeutic protein production in near future.",Adaptive control; Fermentation calorimeter; Interferon α2b; P. pastoris; Process Analytical Technology (PAT); Soft sensor.

The retinal tissues of mouse embryo at 12.5 days (E12.5) and postnatal 14 days (P14) were collected, following by the detection of Insm1 and corresponding markers by immunofluorescent staining. RPCs isolated from retinal tissues at P1 were cultured in culture medium for 7 days. The differentiation of photoreceptor and glial cells was assessed after RPCs transferred to the differentiation medium for 20 days. Next, the effect of Insm1 overexpression on the differentiation of RPCs toward rod photoreceptor and glial cells were assessed. Insm1 was highly expressed in RPCs of retinal tissues and decline in photoreceptor cells, while hardly expressed in glial cells. Based on the results of Pax-6 positive immunofluorescent staining and flow cytometry detection, RPCs were successfully isolated from retinal tissues. After the culture in differentiation medium, RPCs showed positive staining of Rhodopsin and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). Further results showed that overexpression of Insm1 significantly increased the percentage of Rhodopsin positive cells, and up-regulated Sonic Hedgehog (SHH), hairy and enhancer of split homolog-1(Hes1), S-opsin and Rhodopsin levels, while decreased the percentage of Glutamine synthetase positive cells, and reduced Glutamine synthetase and GFAP levels. Whereas, the effect of Insm1 overexpression on these protein levels were partly abolished by the knockdown of SHH or Hes1. We conclude that Insm1 promotes the differentiation of RPCs into photoreceptor cells in the developing retina through up-regulation of SHH.",Hes1; Insm1; Retinal progenitor cell (RPC) differentiation; Rod photoreceptor cells; SHH.
211,A Modified Similarity Metric for Unit Testing of Object-Oriented Software Based on Adaptive Random Testing,"Chen, Jinfu; Kudjo, Patrick Kwaku; Zhang, Zufa; Su, Chenfei; Guo, Yuchi; Huang, Rubing; Song, Heping","Finding an effective method for testing object-oriented software (OOS) has proven elusive in the software community due to the rapid development of object-oriented programming (OOP) technology. Although significant progress has been made by previous studies, challenges still exist in relation to the object distance measurement of OOS using Adaptive Random Testing (ART). This is partly due to the unique features of OOS such as encapsulation, inheritance and polymorphism. In a previous work, we proposed a new similarity metric called the Object and Method Invocation Sequence Similarity (OMISS) metric to facilitate multi-class level testing using ART. In this paper, we broaden the set of models in the metric (OMISS) by considering the method parameter and adding the weight in the metric to develop a new distance metric to improve unit testing of OOS. We used the new distance metric to calculate the distance between the set of objects and the distance between the method sequences of the test cases. Additionally, we integrate the new metric in unit testing with ART and applied it to six open source subject programs. The experimental result shows that the proposed method with method parameter considered in this study is better than previous methods without the method parameter in the case of the single method. Our finding further shows that the proposed unit testing approach is a promising direction for assisting software engineers who seek to improve the failure-detection effectiveness of OOS testing.",Adaptive random testing; object-oriented software; object distance; unit testing; method parameter

213,GVLE: a highly optimized GPU-based implementation of variable-length encoding,"Fuentes-Alventosa, Antonio; Gomez-Luna, Juan; Medina-Carnicer, R.","Nowadays, the massive use of multimedia data gives to data compression a funda-mental role in reducing the storage requirements and communication bandwidth. Variable-length encoding (VLE) is a relevant data compression method that reduces input data size by assigning shorter codewords to mostly used symbols, and longer codewords to rarely utilized symbols. As it is a common strategy in many compres-sion algorithms, such as the popular Huffman coding, speeding VLE up is essen-tial to accelerate them. For this reason, during the last decade and a half, efficient VLE implementations have been presented in the area of General Purpose Graph-ics Processing Units (GPGPU). The main performance issues of the state-of-the-art GPU-based implementations of VLE are the following. First, the way in which the codeword look-up table is stored in shared memory is not optimized to reduce the bank conflicts. Second, input/output data are read/written through inefficient strided global memory accesses. Third, the way in which the thread-codes are built is not optimized to reduce the number of executed instructions. Our goal in this work is to significantly speed up the state-of-the-art implementations of VLE by solving their performance issues. To this end, we propose GVLE, a highly optimized implemen-tation of VLE on GPU, which uses the following optimization strategies. First, the caching of the codeword look-up table is done in a way that minimizes the bank conflicts. Second, input data are read by using vectorized loads to exploit fully the available global memory bandwidth. Third, each thread encoding is performed effi-ciently in the register space with high instruction-level parallelism and lower num-ber of executed instructions. Fourth, a novel inter-block scan method, which out-performs those of state-of-the-art solutions, is used to calculate the bit-positions of the thread-blocks encodings in the output bit-stream. Our proposed mechanism is based on a regular segmented scan performed efficiently on sequences of bit-lengths of 32 consecutive thread-blocks encodings by using global atomic additions. Fifth, output data are written efficiently by executing coalesced global memory stores. An exhaustive experimental evaluation shows that our solution is on average 2.6x faster than the best state-of-the-art implementation. Additionally, it shows that the scan algorithm is on average 1.62x faster if it utilizes our inter-block scan method instead of that of the best state-of-the-art VLE solution. Hence, our inter-block scan method offers promising possibilities to accelerate algorithms that require it, such as the scan itself or the stream compaction.",Data compression; Variable-length encoding; Huffman coding; GPU; CUDA

The two monoclonal transmissible devil facial tumours (DFT1, DFT2) exploit MHC-I pathways to overcome immunological anti-tumour and allogeneic barriers. This exploitation underpins the ongoing transmission of DFT cells across the wild Tasmanian devil population. We have previously shown that the overexpression of NLRC5 in DFT1 and DFT2 cells can regulate components of the MHC-I pathway but not MHC-II, establishing the stable upregulation of MHC-I on the cell surface. As MHC-II molecules are crucial for CD4+ T cell activation, MHC-II expression in tumour cells is beginning to gain traction in the field of immunotherapy and cancer vaccines. The overexpression of Class II transactivator in transfected DFT1 and DFT2 cells induced the transcription of several genes of the MHC-I and MHC-II pathways. This was further supported by the upregulation of MHC-I protein on DFT1 and DFT2 cells, but interestingly MHC-II protein was upregulated only in DFT1 cells. This new insight into the regulation of MHC-I and MHC-II pathways in cells that naturally overcome allogeneic barriers can inform vaccine, immunotherapy and tissue transplant strategies for human and veterinary medicine.",CIITA; DFTD; MHC; devil facial tumour; transmissible cancer.
215,Unified framework for face sketch synthesis,"Wang, Nannan; Zhang, Shengchuan; Gao, Xinbo; Li, Jie; Song, Bin; Li, Zan","Face sketch synthesis (FSS) has great significance to sketch based face retrieval or recognition and digital entertainment. Recently, great progress has been made in face sketch synthesis. Most state-of-the-art FSS methods work at patch level. However, these methods only consider either position constraint or global search when selecting candidate image patches. Furthermore, the common used weighting combination in these methods leads to the lost of reasonable high frequency details. We argue that all these factors are necessary for face sketch synthesis. To this end, we propose a simple yet effective unified approach considering position constraint, global search and high frequency compensation to infer pseudosketches from input test photos. Firstly, a nearest-neighbor search is conducted by combining both position constraint and global search. After obtaining the candidate image patches, a Markov network is applied to generate the pseudosketch. Secondly, the residue between an original sketch and the synthesized pseudosketch is modeled by the same Markov network to compensate the high frequency details. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated on the CUHK face sketch database by comparing with state-of-the-art FSS methods. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Therefore, mitigation methods are required to ensure reliable operations. However, as there are different types of interference, robust, multi-purpose mitigation algorithms are needed. This paper describes the most popular state-of-the-art interference mitigation techniques. The high-rate DFT-based data manipulator (HDDM) is proposed as a possible solution to overcome their limitations. This paper presents a hardware implementation of the HDDM algorithm. The hardware HDDM module is integrated in three different receivers equipped with analog radio-frequency (RF) front-ends supporting signals with different dynamic range. The resource utilization and power consumption is evaluated for the three cases. The algorithm is compared to a low-end mass-market receiver and a high-end professional receiver with basic and sophisticated interference mitigation capabilities, respectively. Different type of interference are used to compare the mitigation capabilities of the receivers under test. Results of the HDDM hardware implementation achieve the similar or improved performance to the state of the art.

Obviously, highly reactive metabolic intermediates, like thioesters and mixed anhydrides between phosphoric acid and organic acids, modify lysine residues spontaneously. Additionally, enzymes using acyl-CoAs as co-substrates transfer the acyl residue specifically to defined sequences within proteins. The counteracting enzymes are called histone deacetylases (HDACs), releasing the free lysine side chain. Such enzymatic activities are involved in different cellular processes like tumor progression, immune response, regulation of metabolism, and aging. Modulators of such enzymatic activities represent valuable tools in drug discovery. Therefore, direct and continuous assays to monitor enzymatic activity of HDACs are needed. Here we describe different assay formats allowing both monitoring of Zn2+-dependent HDACs via UV-Vis-spectroscopy and NAD+-dependent HDACs (sirtuins) by fluorescence-based assay formats. Additionally, we describe methods enabling efficient screening of HDAC-inhibitors via fluorescence displacement assays.",Activity assay; Histone deacetylase; Inhibitor measurement; Sirtuin.

This paper constructs a simultaneous equation model and uses three-stage least squares to estimate the effect and mechanism of industrial convergence on economic growth and carbon emissions. The results show that (i) industrial convergence improves the change of total factor productivity (TFP) and the change of technical efficiency, and the reduction of carbon emissions is the main factor driving the growth of TFP and technical efficiency; (ii) industrial convergence and carbon emissions show a significant U-shaped relationship; (iii) the heterogeneity analysis shows that the convergence of capital-intensive, technology-intensive and labor-intensive manufacturing with digital services will help to improve the growth of TFP, it can inhibit carbon emissions first and then promote it.

Neuroinflammation and disturbance of glutamate metabolism in brain regions, such as the hippocampus, play vital roles in the development of depression. Previous studies have shown that cyanidin chloride (Cycl) has anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties with neuroprotective effects in peripheral tissues. However, the effects of Cycl on depression and the possible mechanism by which this compound targets brain regions remain less elucidated. We investigated the role of Cycl in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced depression and examined the influence of the drug on central inflammation and the expression of excitatory amino acid transporters in the hippocampus. We found that prophylactic i.p. application of Cycl at 20 or 40 mg/kg for 5 days significantly reduced the immobility time assessed by the tail suspension test (TST) and forced swim test (FST) in LPS-challenged mice, suggesting an effective antidepressant activity of the drug. Western blotting and immunofluorescence staining in the hippocampus revealed that Cycl inhibited the upregulation of proinflammatory cytokines, including TNF-α and IL-6, and suppressed the hyperactivity of microglia induced by LPS, indicating an anti-inflammatory role in the hippocampus. Moreover, treatment with Cycl also recovered the downregulated expression of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and glutamate-aspartate transporter (GLAST) and excitatory amino acid transporter 2 (EAAT2), two members in the excitatory amino acid transporter family. The role of Cycl was also verified in cultured BV2 and U251 cells. In conclusion, the present in vivo and in vitro studies demonstrate that Cycl exerts potent antidepressant action in an LPS-induced depression model and the underlying mechanism is associated with reduced hippocampal inflammation, improved neurotrophic function, and attenuated excitotoxicity induced by glutamate.",BDNF; EAAT; cyanidin chloride; depression; hippocampus; neuroinflammation.
220,Non-human contributions to personality neuroscience - from fish through primates. An introduction to the special issue,"Yury V Lages,Neil McNaughton,Yury V Lages,Neil McNaughton","The most fundamental emotional systems that show trait control are evolutionarily old and extensively conserved. Psychology in general has benefited from non-human neuroscience and from the analytical simplicity of behaviour in those with simpler nervous systems. It has been argued that integration between personality, psychopathology, and neuroscience is particularly promising if we are to understand the neurobiology of human experience. Here, we provide some general arguments for a non-human approach being at least as productive in relation to personality, psychopathology, and their interface. Some early personality theories were directly linked to psychopathology (e.g., Eysenck, Panksepp, and Cloninger). They shared a common interest in brain systems that naturally led to the use of non-human data; behavioural, neural, and pharmacological. In Eysenck's case, this also led to the selective breeding, at the Maudsley Institute, of emotionally reactive and non-reactive strains of rat as models of trait neuroticism or trait emotionality. Dimensional personality research and categorical approaches to clinical disorder then drifted apart from each other, from neuropsychology, and from non-human data. Recently, the conceptualizations of both healthy personality and psychopathology have moved towards a common hierarchical trait perspective. Indeed, the proposed two sets of trait dimensions appear similar and may even be eventually the same. We provide, here, an introduction to this special issue of Personality Neuroscience, where the authors provide overviews of detailed areas where non-human data inform human personality and its psychopathology or provide explicit models for translation to human neuroscience. Once all the papers in the issue have appeared, we will also provide a concluding summary of them.",Evolution; Neuroscience; Personality; Psychopathology; Translation.
221,Improving the Tourist's Perception of the Tourist Destinations Image: An Analysis of Chinese Kung Fu Film and Television,"Chen, Huan; Zuo, Yifan; Law, Rob; Zhang, Mu","Cultural media, film, and television works can increase the popularity of the image of tourist destinations, thereby promoting the sustainable development of the tourism industry and obtaining economic benefits. This study takes Chinese kung fu film and television as examples to explore the mechanism of audience participation in the perception of tourist destinations. It further explores the mediating effect of cultural contact. The study took the image perception of tourist destinations as the dependent variable and audience participation as the independent variable. A total of 331 subjects were surveyed, and a multi-layer regression model was established to test the rationality and validity of the hypothetical theoretical model. The research results show that audience participation in martial arts films and television tourism can directly and indirectly affect the audience's perception of martial arts culture. At the same time, the viewer can achieve contact with martial arts culture through film and television, accordingly forming his or her perception of the destination. In other words, film and television audience participation can bring more cultural contact to the audience. In turn, cultural contact can enhance the image perception of tourist destinations and play an important intermediary role in the process of audience participation by enhancing the perception of tourist destinations. By confirming the variable relationship in Wushu film and television tourism, this research fills the gap between the two aspects, which contributes to promoting the two-way interaction between Wushu film and television works and tourism marketing and achieving the long-term sustainable development of tourism destinations.",Chinese Kungfu film and television works; audience participation; cultural contact; image perception of tourist destinations; sustainable development

We show that using one of them is sufficient for saving time while encoding to keep the implementation complexity low. Compared with full CU search in HEVC standards, the proposed method reduces the encoding time by 57 and 49 % on average with Low Delay and Random Access profiles, respectively, with acceptable bitrate and PSNR performances. Compared with two state-of-the-art methods, the encoding time reduction is up to 23 and 13 % with Low Delay profile, 7 and 3 % with Random Access profile, on average, whereas the performances of bitrate and PSNR are similar.",HEVC (high-efficiency video coding); CU (coding unit) decision; Early termination algorithm; Statistical analysis; LCU (largest coding unit) classification
224,Nursing Students and the Human Body: Application of an Ethics Pilot Project,"Garrigues, Layla; Soule, Isabelle; Vermeesch, Amber L.","This manuscript offers findings from a pilot project which prepares nursing students for embodied professional practice through the lens of ethics. Four undergraduate nursing students were mentored by two nursing faculty in the Dundon-Berchtold Institute Faculty Fellowship Program in the Application of Ethics through an exploration on the ethics of embodiment using an arts pedagogy across one academic year. Inspired by the intersection of nature and health, this project explores the impact of an arts-integrated pedagogy on the human body. The findings from this project provide a natural first step for nursing students to consider multiple interpretations of the human body and to facilitate the students' development of an embodied ethical practice that is perceptive, empathic, and attuned to themselves as natural beings as well as diverse individuals and populations. The findings from this pilot project presents a pivotal opportunity to guide future nursing curricular development toward holistic, nature-inspired, and mindful-based interventions in order to increase resilience, decrease risk factors of compassion fatigue and burnout, and support nursing students to develop strength-based skills to use in their professional nursing practice.",nature; connectivity; natural worlds; environment; arts; embodiment; physical body; attunement
225,Digital camera identification by fingerprint's compact representation,"Bernacki, Jaroslaw","In this paper we deal with the issue of digital camera identification (DCI) based on images. This area matches the digital forensics (DF) research. This topic has attracted many researchers and number of algorithms for DCI have been proposed. However, majority of them focus only on camera identification with high accuracy without taking into account the speed of image processing. In this paper we propose an effective algorithm for much faster camera identification than state-of-the-art algorithms. Experimental evaluation conducted on two large image datasets including almost 14.000 images confirms that the proposed algorithm achieves high classification accuracy of 97 [%] in much shorter time compared with state-of-the-art algorithms which obtained 92.0 - 96.0 [%]. We also perform a statistical analysis of obtained results which confirms their reliability.",Camera identification; Digital forensics; Hardwaremetry; Individual source camera identification; Sensor identification
226,Pattern-Based Dynamic Compilation System for CGRAs With Online Configuration Transformation,"Liu, Leibo; Man, Xingchen; Zhu, Jianfeng; Yin, Shouyi; Wei, Shaojun","Prevailing data-intensive applications, such as artificial intelligence and internet of things, demand considerable compute capability. Coarse-grained reconfigurable architectures (CGRAs) can meet this demand via providing abundant compute resources. However, compilation has become an essential problem because the increasing resources need to be orchestrated efficiently. Static compilation is insufficient due to conservative resource allocation and exponentially increasing time cost while state-of-the-art dynamic compilation still performs poorly in both generality and efficiency. This article proposes a dynamic compilation system for CGRAs through online pattern-based configuration transformation, which enables virtualization to improve resource utilization and flexibility. It utilizes statically-generated patterns to straightforwardly determine dynamic placement of registers and operations so that the transformation algorithm has a low complexity. Domain-specific features are extracted by a k-means clustering algorithm to help improve the quality of patterns. The experimental results show that statically compiled applications can be transformed onto arbitrary resources at runtime, reserving 73.5 (22.8-163.3 percent) of the original performance/resource on average, 9.1 (0-52.9 percent) better than the state-of-the-art non-general methods.",CGRA; dynamic compilation; configuration transformation

The HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) infection status of this population can reflect the global HIV epidemic trend to a certain extent. Therefore, we conducted a retrospective epidemic survey to clarify the prevalence and characteristics of HIV-1 infection among inbound travelers applying for Shanghai residency. The retrospective cohort analysis included a total of 50,830 inbound tourists/travelers who applied for Shanghai residency from 2005 to 2016. HIV-1 infection rates were determined based on HIV-1 antibody testing. Among all the recruited inbound travelers, 245 were HIV-1 positive, with an infection rate of 0.48%. The detection rate of HIV in males was significantly higher than in females (χ2 = 62.584, P < 0.0001). Those aged 18-30 years, 31-40 years, and >40 years accounted for 34.3%, 39.6%, and 26.1% of the infected population, respectively. Although the annual detection rates were different, the trend analysis results showed no increase in HIV-1 prevalence rates among the sampling years (Cochran-Armitage Z = 2.543, P = 0.111). Proportions of individuals infected through homosexual transmission increased over the study period (Cochran-Armitage Z = 5.41, P < 0.001), while the proportion infected through heterosexual declined over time (Cochran-Armitage Z = 3.38, P = 0.001). The rate and characteristics of HIV-1 infection among foreign applicants for residency in Shanghai were identified in the study. The results provide the necessary epidemiological data for monitoring the HIV-1 epidemic among international entry travelers and contribute to establishing relevant policies and regulations for HIV control and prevention.",HIV (human immunodeficiency virus)-1; prevalence; travelers.

It is imperative that new models of epileptiform brain activity account for this variability, to identify individual needs and allow clinicians to curate personalized care. Here, we use a hidden Markov model (HMM) to create a unique statistical model of interictal brain activity for 10 pediatric patients. We use magnetoencephalography (MEG) data acquired as part of standard clinical care for patients at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. These data are routinely analyzed using excess kurtosis mapping (EKM); however, as cases become more complex (extreme multifocal and/or polymorphic activity), they become harder to interpret with EKM. We assessed the performance of the HMM against EKM for three patient groups, with increasingly complicated presentation. The difference in localization of epileptogenic foci for the two methods was 7 ± 2 mm (mean ± SD over all 10 patients); and 94% ± 13% of EKM temporal markers were matched by an HMM state visit. The HMM localizes epileptogenic areas (in agreement with EKM) and provides additional information about the relationship between those areas. A key advantage over current methods is that the HMM is a data-driven model, so the output is tuned to each individual. Finally, the model output is intuitive, allowing a user (clinician) to review the result and manually select the HMM epileptiform state, offering multiple advantages over previous methods and allowing for broader implementation of MEG epileptiform analysis in surgical decision-making for patients with intractable epilepsy.",epilepsy; hidden Markov model; interictal activity; magnetoencephalography.

A method based on OCT speckle decorrelation was developed to visualize and quantify the scar vasculature over the treatment period. Through reliable co-location of the imaging field of view across multiple imaging sessions, and compensation for motion artifact, the study was able to track the same scar tissue over a period of several months, and quantify changes in the vasculature area density. The results show incidences of occlusion of individual vessels 3 days after the first treatment. The subsequent responses ˜20 weeks after the initial treatment show differences between immature and mature scars. Image analysis showed a distinct decrease (25 ± 13%, mean ± standard deviation) and increase (19 ± 5%) of vasculature area density for the immature and mature scars, respectively.

Postoperative anastomotic leaks after colorectal surgery can have severe consequences for patients, particularly ones who present with few or no symptoms. Computed tomography and/or water-soluble contrast enema (WSE) are the most frequently utilized imaging methods to identify and diagnose anastomotic leaks early. WSE is a safe and complication-free procedure that allows to identify the presence of otherwise unrecognized anastomotic leaks, both in asymptomatic and symptomatic patients. Fluoroscopic rectal examination using a water-soluble contrast agent for postoperative patients is never an easy examination to perform since it requires careful preparation, skill, and knowledge. Four morphological types of anastomotic dispersion have been described: ""saccular type"", ""horny type"", ""serpentine type"" and ""dendritic type"". Among 4 types of leakage, dendritic and serpentine types are more frequently followed by clinical symptoms and none of the dendritic type resolves spontaneously. On the other hand, the saccular and horny types have a better prognosis after healing of the loss and subsequent restoration of the ostomy as they consist of a cavity that provides a sort of physical barrier to the spread of inflammation. The aim of this pictorial essay was to illustrate the spectrum of imaging findings of morphological types of radiologic leakages on WCE in patients with colorectal surgical anastomosis. We have also tried to provide tips and tools to enable identification of radiological leakages on retrograde WCE, particularly of the smallest leaks which can be more easily missed.",Anastomotic leakage; Colorectal surgery; Complications; Rectal neoplasms; Water-soluble enema.

233,Lightweight Polymer-Carbon Composite Current Collector for Lithium-Ion Batteries,"Fritsch, Marco; Coeler, Matthias; Kunz, Karina; Krause, Beate; Marcinkowski, Peter; Potschke, Petra; Wolter, Mareike; Michaelis, Alexander","A hermetic dense polymer-carbon composite-based current collector foil (PCCF) for lithium-ion battery applications was developed and evaluated in comparison to state-of-the-art aluminum (Al) foil collector. Water-processed LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 (LMNO) cathode and Li4Ti5O12 (LTO) anode coatings with the integration of a thin carbon primer at the interface to the collector were prepared. Despite the fact that the laboratory manufactured PCCF shows a much higher film thickness of 55 mu m compared to Al foil of 19 mu m, the electrode resistance was measured to be by a factor of 5 lower compared to the Al collector, which was attributed to the low contact resistance between PCCF, carbon primer and electrode microstructure. The PCCF-C-primer collector shows a sufficient voltage stability up to 5 V vs. Li/Li+ and a negligible Li-intercalation loss into the carbon primer. Electrochemical cell tests demonstrate the applicability of the developed PCCF for LMNO and LTO electrodes, with no disadvantage compared to state-of-the-art Al collector. Due to a 50% lower material density, the lightweight and hermetic dense PCCF polymer collector offers the possibility to significantly decrease the mass loading of the collector in battery cells, which can be of special interest for bipolar battery architectures.",lithium-ion battery; bipolar battery; polymer-carbon composite; current collector; water-based electrode slurries; carbon primer; CNTs; LMNO; LTO
234,Identification and Fungicide Sensitivity of Colletotrichum spp. from Apple Flowers and Fruitlets in Brazil,"Jhulia Gelain,Sydney Lykins,Pâmela Franciella Rosa,Alex Teixeira Soares,Madeline Dowling,Guido Schnabel,Louise Larissa May De Mio,Jhulia Gelain,Sydney Lykins,Pâmela Franciella Rosa,Alex Teixeira Soares,Madeline Dowling,Guido Schnabel,Louise Larissa May De Mio","Glomerella leaf spot (GLS) and bitter rot (BR), caused by Colletotrichum spp., are major diseases on apple in southern Brazil. Among integrated pest management tools for disease management in commercial orchards, fungicides remain an important component. This study aimed to identify Colletotrichum spp. from cultivar Eva in Paraná state orchards; evaluate their in vitro sensitivity to cyprodinil, tebuconazole, iprodione, and fluazinam; and determine the baseline in vitro sensitivity of these isolates to benzovindiflupyr and natamycin. Most isolates belonged to Colletotrichum melonis and C. nymphaeae of the C. acutatum species complex. The two species varied in sensitivity to fluazinam and tebuconazole, but no variability was found for any other fungicide. The lowest 50% effective concentration (EC50) values of Colletotrichum spp. were observed for cyprodinil (mean EC50 < 0.02) and benzovindiflupyr (mean EC50 < 0.05); EC50 values were intermediate for fluazinam (mean EC50 < 0.33) and tebuconazole (mean EC50 < 0.14), and they were highest for natamycin (mean EC50 < 5.56) and iprodione (mean EC50 > 12). Cyprodinil and fluazinam are registered for use in Brazil for apple disease management but not specifically for GLS and BR. Tebuconazole is one of the few products registered for Colletotrichum spp. control in apples. In conclusion, flowers and fruitlets can serve as sources of inoculum for GLS and BR disease; C. acutatum was the predominant species complex in these tissues; cyprodinil and fluazinam applications may suppress GLS and BR; and benzovindiflupyr and natamycin warrant further investigation for GLS and BR disease control of apple due to comparably high in vitro sensitivity.",Glomerella leaf spot; baseline sensitivity; benzovindiflupyr; bitter rot; chemical control; natamycin.

Herein, we report a promiscuous cyclohexanone monooxygenase (CHMO) for the photoinduced synthesis of chiral α-fluoroketones via enantioselective reductive dehalogenation of α,α-halofluoroketones. Wild-type CHMO from Acinetobacter sp. possesses this promiscuous ability innately; however, the yield and stereoselectivity are low. A structure-guided rational design of CHMO improved the yield and stereoselectivity remarkably. Mechanistic studies and molecular simulations demonstrated that this photoinduced CHMO catalyzes the reductive dehalogenation via a novel electron transfer (ET)/proton transfer (PT) mechanism, distinct from that of previously reported reductases with similar promiscuity. This methodology was expanded to various substrates, and desirable chiral α-fluoroketones were obtained in high yields (up to 99 %) and e.r. values (up to 99:1).",Biocatalysis; Cyclohexanone Monooxygenase; Promiscuity; Protein Engineering; α-Fluoroketones.

Our near-lossless RWA (NLRWA) proposal can be followed by any entropy coding technique. Here, the NLRWA is coupled with a bitplane-based coder that supports progressive decoding. This successfully enables gradual quality refinement and lossless and near-lossless recovery. A smart strategy for selecting the NLRWA quantization steps is also included.

240,An efficient and low power one-lambda crosstalk avoidance code design for network on chips,"Shirmohammadi, Zahra; Mahdavi, Zeinab","Crosstalk faults occurring in wires of Networks on Chip (NoCs) can seriously threaten the reliability of data transfer. One efficient way to tackle crosstalk faults is numeral-based Crosstalk Avoidance Codes (CACs). Numeral-based CACs reduce crosstalk faults by preventing specific transition patterns to occur. One-Lambda Codes (OLCs) are the most efficient types of CACs. However, the codec of OLCs imposes overheads including power consumption, critical path and area occupation to the routers of NoCs. To find overhead-efficient OLCs, this paper proposes an Algorithm for Generating OLC Numeral systems (AGON). AGON provides a tradeoff for designers in selecting overhead-efficient OLCs. Using AGON, an efficient numeral-based OLC called Subtraction based-Numeral (Sub-Num) is proposed that benefits the Numeral system that can omit OLC-induced transition patterns completely. In addition, the mapping algorithm of Sub-Num can reduce the overheads of codec more efficiently than the other state-of-the art OLCs. Evaluation results using SPICE and VHDL simulations show that Sub-Num reduces power consumption and average delay of wires by 10% and 9%, and also overheads of codecs including dynamic power consumption, critical path and area occupation by 52%, 51% and 21%, respectively as compared to the state-of-the-art numeral-based OLC.",Network-on-chip; Reliability; Crosstalk avoidance code; Numeral System
241,Compression of 3D Point Clouds Using a Region-Adaptive Hierarchical Transform,"de Queiroz, Ricardo L.; Chou, Philip A.","In free-viewpoint video, there is a recent trend to represent scene objects as solids rather than using multiple depth maps. Point clouds have been used in computer graphics for a long time, and with the recent possibility of real-time capturing and rendering, point clouds have been favored over meshes in order to save computation. Each point in the cloud is associated with its 3D position and its color. We devise a method to compress the colors in point clouds, which is based on a hierarchical transform and arithmetic coding. The transform is a hierarchical sub-band transform that resembles an adaptive variation of a Haar wavelet. The arithmetic encoding of the coefficients assumes Laplace distributions, one per sub-band. The Laplace parameter for each distribution is transmitted to the decoder using a custom method. The geometry of the point cloud is encoded using the well-established octtree scanning. Results show that the proposed solution performs comparably with the current state-of-the-art, in many occasions outperforming it, while being much more computationally efficient. We believe this paper represents the state of the art in intra-frame compression of point clouds for real-time 3D video.",Point cloud compression; 3D immersive video; free-viewpoint video; RAHT; real-time point cloud transmission

State-of-the-art systems need handcraft features and do not take into account the representation of the low-frequency words. To address these issues, a Bi-LSTM-CRF neural network architecture based on medical knowledge features is proposed. First, we employ convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to encode character-level information of a word and extract medical knowledge features from an open-source clinical knowledge system. Then, we concatenate character-level and word-level embedding and the medical knowledge features of words together, and feed them into bi-directional long short-term memory (Bi-LSTM) to build context information of each word. Finally, we jointly use a conditional random field (CRF) to decode labels for the whole sentence. We evaluate our model on two publicly available clinical datasets, namely THYME corpus and 2012 i2b2 dataset. Experimental results show that our model outperforms previous state-of-the-art systems with different methodologies, including machine learning-based methods, deep learning-based methods, and Bert-based methods.",Deep learning; Unified modeling language; Natural language processing; Semantics; Recurrent neural networks; Medical diagnostic imaging; Learning systems; Clinical diagnosis; Medical services; Clinical text; entity recognition; deep learning; natural language processing

Given the limited capacity of the formal health care sector to address these public health issues, attention is turning to the role of agencies active in civil society. This paper sought to evaluate the associations between participation in community centre activities, the psycho-social wellbeing and health related behaviours. This was based on an evaluation of the South West Well-being programme involving ten organisations delivering leisure, exercise, cooking, befriending, arts and crafts activities. The evaluation consisted of a before-and-after study with 687 adults. The results showed positive changes in self-reported general health, mental health, personal and social well-being. Positive changes were associated with diet and physical activity. Some activities were different in their outcomes-especially in cases where group activities were combined with one-to-one support. The results suggest that community centre activities of this nature offer benefits that are generically supportive of health behaviour changes. Such initiatives can perform an important role in supporting the health improvement objectives of formal health care services. For commissioners and partner agencies, accessibility and participation are attractive features that are particularly pertinent to the current public health context.",community development; arts and health; healthy living; holistic programmes; well-being

Assessment of the bone pharmacokinetics of antimicrobials is challenged by a lack of validated methods. In this study, 1000 mg of vancomycin was administered as a single dose over 100 min to eight female pigs. Plasma, subcutaneous adipose tissue (SCAT) and bone pharmacokinetics were investigated over 12 h. Microdialysis was applied for collection of samples in bone and SCAT. The vancomycin concentration in microdialysates was determined using ultra-high performance liquid chromatography, whilst the free plasma concentration was determined using Cobas c501. The mean (95% CI) area under the concentration-time curve (AUC(0-last); minμg/mL) was 9375 (7445-11304), 9304 (7374-11233), 5998 (3955-8040) and 3451 (1522-5381) for plasma, SCAT, and cancellous and cortical bone, respectively (ANOVA P-value < 0.001). Both cortical and cancellous bone AUC0-last were lower than that of free plasma (P < 0.01). Peak drug concentrations (C(max)) in cortical and cancellous bone were also significantly lower than that of free plasma (P < 0.001). Moreover, both AUC(0-last) and C(max) were significantly lower in cortical bone than in cancellous bone (P < 0.025). Bone penetration of vancomycin was found to be incomplete and delayed. Significant differences in pharmacokinetics between cancellous and cortical bone suggest that bone may not be considered as one compartment.

A 65-year-old female patient reported discomfort in a maxillary tooth gingiva. Clinically, a dental metal-ceramic bridge with adequate marginal adaptation, involving teeth from maxillary right canine to maxillary right second molar, was observed. The periapical radiograph showed the adequate adaptation of the crown and post in the maxillary right first premolar, an apical lesion, and the heavy thickening of the maxillary sinus floor mucosa. The diagnosis established in the maxillary right first premolar was of a previously treated tooth and a chronic apical abscess. Considering the accurate fixed prosthesis adaptation and the impossibility of disassembling the five-piece-metal-ceramic bridge to perform a new endodontic treatment and the prosthetic restoration, an endodontic microsurgery of this tooth was performed. The post-treatment follow-up of 12-month recall showed a normal thickness sinus membrane and a regenerating cortical bone.

We then continue to discuss programming languages as the linking element between different levels of software and hardware in the network. We review electronic switching systems, highlighting programmability and reconfiguration aspects, and describe the trends in reconfigurable network elements. Finally, we describe the state of the art in the integration of photonic transceiver and switching elements with electronic technologies, and consider the implications for SDN and reconfigurable network systems.",Field-programmable gate array (FPGA); reconfigurable devices; software-defined networks; switching fabrics

249,Segmentation of Overlapping Cytoplasm in Cervical Smear Images via Adaptive Shape Priors Extracted From Contour Fragments,"Song, Youyi; Zhu, Lei; Qin, Jing; Lei, Baiying; Sheng, Bin; Choi, Kup-Sze","We present a novel approach for segmenting overlapping cytoplasm of cells in cervical smear images by leveraging the adaptive shape priors extracted from cytoplasm's contour fragments and shape statistics. The main challenge of this task is that many occluded boundaries in cytoplasm clumps are extremely difficult to be identified and, sometimes, even visually indistinguishable. Given a clump where multiple cytoplasms overlap, our method starts by cutting its contour into a set of contour fragments. We then locate the corresponding contour fragments of each cytoplasm by a grouping process. For each cytoplasm, according to the grouped fragments and a set of known shape references, we construct its shape and, then, connect the fragments to forma closed contour as the segmentation result, which is explicitly constrained by the constructed shape. We further integrate the intensity and curvature information, which is complementary to the shape priors extracted from contour fragments, into our framework to improve the segmentation accuracy. We propose to iteratively conduct fragments grouping, shape constructing, and fragments connecting for progressively refining the shape priors and improving the segmentation results. We extensively evaluate the effectiveness of our method on two typical cervical smear datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that our approach is highly effective and consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches. The proposed method is general enough to be applied to other similar microscopic image segmentation tasks, where heavily overlapped objects exist.",Overlapping cytoplasm segmentation; contour fragments; fragments grouping and connecting; automatic cervical cancer screening

However, the precise underlying mechanism remains unclear. In this study, we performed double-target neural circuit-magnetic stimulation on the left motor cortex and bilateral L5 nerve root for 3 successive weeks in a rat model of incomplete spinal cord injury caused by compression at T10. Results showed that in the injured spinal cord, the expression of the astrocyte marker glial fibrillary acidic protein and inflammatory factors interleukin 1β, interleukin-6, and tumor necrosis factor-α had decreased, whereas that of neuronal survival marker microtubule-associated protein 2 and synaptic plasticity markers postsynaptic densification protein 95 and synaptophysin protein had increased. Additionally, neural signaling of the descending corticospinal tract was markedly improved and rat locomotor function recovered significantly. These findings suggest that double-target neural circuit-magnetic stimulation improves rat motor function by attenuating astrocyte activation, thus providing a theoretical basis for application of double-target neural circuit-magnetic stimulation in the clinical treatment of spinal cord injury.",astrocyte; inflammatory response; microtubule-associated protein 2; motor function; motor-evoked potential; neural circuit-magnetic stimulation; neural repair; neuromodulation technique; spinal cord injury; synaptic plasticity.
251,Computer aided disassembly planning: State of the art and perspectives,"Santochi, M; Dini, G; Failli, F","In the last two decades, the problems related to the preservation of the environment and the resources of the planet have been dramatically highlighted by different phenomena (thinning of ozone layer, greenhouse effect, decreasing of forests, air pollution, increasing difficulties in the industrial and domestic waste management, etc.). In order to face this situation, the governments have begun to apply rules to control some aspects of the industrial production and energy. Consequently, the environment has become an interesting issue also for the researchers. A key-point in these new techniques, grouped under the name of ""sustainable development"", is the disassembly and recycling of the end-of-life goods, necessary to minimize the environmental impact of discarded materials and energy consumption. In this keynote paper the state of the art of the software tools developed to help the designer and the dismantler in the optimization of the disassembly-for-recycling of discarded goods is discussed. The architecture of a complete and general computer aided disassembly planning system is described and a number of system developed both in the academic institutes and in the industry are shown together a review and classification of the different adopted solutions.",disassembly; recycling; planning

253,A novel random forests based class incremental learning method for activity recognition,"Hu, Chunyu; Chen, Yiqiang; Hu, Lisha; Peng, Xiaohui","Automatic activity recognition is an active research topic which aims to identify human activities automatically. A significant challenge is to recognize new activities effectively. In this paper, we propose an effective class incremental learning method, named Class Incremental Random Forests (CIRF), to enable existing activity recognition models to identify new activities. We design a separating axis theorem based splitting strategy to insert internal nodes and adopt Gini index or information gain to split leaves of the decision tree in the random forests (RF). With these two strategies, both inserting new nodes and splitting leaves are allowed in the incremental learning phase. We evaluate our method on three UCI public activity datasets and compare with other state-of-the-art methods. Experimental results show that the proposed incremental learning method converges to the performance of batch learning methods (RF and extremely randomized trees). Compared with other state-of-the-art methods, it is able to recognize new class data continuously with a better performance. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

254,Relation-Based Deep Attention Network with Hybrid Memory for One-Shot Person Re-Identification,"Si, Runxuan; Zhao, Jing; Tang, Yuhua; Yang, Shaowu","One-shot person Re-identification, which owns one labeled sample among numerous unlabeled data for each identity, is proposed to tackle the problem of the shortage of labeled data. Considering the scenarios without sufficient labeled data, it is very challenging to keep abreast of the performance of the supervised task in which sufficient labeled samples are available. In this paper, we propose a relation-based attention network with hybrid memory, which can make full use of the global information to pay attention to the identity features for model training with the relation-based attention network. Importantly, our specially designed network architecture effectively reduces the interference of environmental noise. Moreover, we propose a hybrid memory to train the one-shot data and unlabeled data in a unified framework, which notably contributes to the performance of person Re-identification. In particular, our designed one-shot feature update mode effectively alleviates the problem of overfitting, which is caused by the lack of supervised information during the training process. Compared with state-of-the-art unsupervised and one-shot algorithms for person Re-identification, our method achieves considerable improvements of 6.7%, 4.6%, and 11.5% on Market-1501, DukeMTMC-reID, and MSMT17 datasets, respectively, and becomes the new state-of-the-art method for one-shot person Re-identification.",hybrid memory; attention; Re-identification; one shot

In recent years, several computational models have been used to implement segmentation methods but without establishing a single analytic solution. However, the intrinsic properties of neural networks make them an interesting approach, despite some measure of inefficiency. This paper presents a clustering approach for image segmentation based on a modified fuzzy approach for image segmentation (ART) model. The goal of the proposed approach is to find a simple model able to instance a prototype for each cluster avoiding complex post-processing phases.

To treat the underlying plaque deposits in the arterial walls, intravascular optical coherence tomography can be used by experts to detect and characterize the lesions. In clinical routine, hundreds of images are acquired for each patient, which require automatic plaque detection for fast and accurate decision support. So far, automatic approaches rely on classic machine learning methods and deep learning solutions have rarely been studied. Given the success of deep learning methods with other imaging modalities, a thorough understanding of deep learning-based plaque detection for future clinical decision support systems is required. We address this issue with a new data set consisting of in vivo patient images labeled by three trained experts. Using this data set, we employ the state-of-the-art deep learning models that directly learn plaque classification from the images. For improved performance, we study different transfer learning approaches. Furthermore, we investigate the use of Cartesian and polar image representations and employ data augmentation techniques tailored to each representation. We fuse both representations in a multi-path architecture for more effective feature exploitation. Last, we address the challenge of plaque differentiation in addition to detection. Overall, we find that our combined model performs best with an accuracy of 91.7%, a sensitivity of 90.9%, and a specificity of 92.4%.

257,Image Reconstruction Based on Total Variation Minimization for Radioactive Wastes Tomographic Gamma Scanning From Sparse Projections,"Shi, Rui; Zheng, Honglong; Tuo, Xianguo; Wang, Changming; Yang, Jianbo; Cheng, Yi; Liu, Mingzhe; Zhang, Songbai","Tomographic Gamma Scanning (TGS) is one of the most important non-destructive analyzed techniques for radioactive waste drums. By reconstructing the radioactivity distribution image, it can accurately realize the qualitative, quantitative, and positioning analysis of the radionuclides in the drum. However, the time consuming of the scanning is long and the reconstructed image is rough, which limits its good application in the practical assay of the waste drum. In this work, the total variational minimization (TVM) method was applied to improve the iterative process of the conventional algorithms of maximum likelihood expectation maximization (MLEM) and algebraic reconstruction technique (ART), then the MLEM-TVM and ART-TVM reconstruction methods were developed. The transmitted experiments were carried out where four kinds of materials were arranged in a segment whose densities ranging from 1.04 g/cm(3) to 2.02 g/cm(3) and a Eu-152 isotope was set up as a transmission source. Compared with the traditional algorithms MLEM and ART, the MLEM-TVM and the ART-TVM algorithms have a better performance on the accuracy and the signal-to-noise ratio, and the MLEM-TVM algorithm achieves the best results, which means the quality of the reconstructed image is improved. The accuracy and effectiveness of the TVM method used in the TGS image reconstruction are verified in the work, and moreover, it can save the scanning time and enhance the TGS image resolution through sparse projection sampling.",Image reconstruction; Subspace constraints; TV; Attenuation; Iterative algorithms; Minimization; Radioactive waste; Image reconstruction; radioactive wastes; tomographic gamma scanning; total variation minimization

259,RS-SSKD: Self-Supervision Equipped with Knowledge Distillation for Few-Shot Remote Sensing Scene Classification,"Zhang, Pei; Li, Ying; Wang, Dong; Wang, Jiyue","While growing instruments generate more and more airborne or satellite images, the bottleneck in remote sensing (RS) scene classification has shifted from data limits toward a lack of ground truth samples. There are still many challenges when we are facing unknown environments, especially those with insufficient training data. Few-shot classification offers a different picture under the umbrella of meta-learning: digging rich knowledge from a few data are possible. In this work, we propose a method named RS-SSKD for few-shot RS scene classification from a perspective of generating powerful representation for the downstream meta-learner. Firstly, we propose a novel two-branch network that takes three pairs of original-transformed images as inputs and incorporates Class Activation Maps (CAMs) to drive the network mining, the most relevant category-specific region. This strategy ensures that the network generates discriminative embeddings. Secondly, we set a round of self-knowledge distillation to prevent overfitting and boost the performance. Our experiments show that the proposed method surpasses current state-of-the-art approaches on two challenging RS scene datasets: NWPU-RESISC45 and RSD46-WHU. Finally, we conduct various ablation experiments to investigate the effect of each component of the proposed method and analyze the training time of state-of-the-art methods and ours.",remote-sensing; scene classification; few-shot learning; meta-learning; self-supervised; knowledge distillation

This study has applied dynamic factor analysis (DFA) and cluster analysis (CA) to analyze time-series water quality data monitored at the five stations installed along the La Buong river in Southern Vietnam. Application of the DFA identified two types of temporal patterns, one of the run-off driven parameters (total suspended solid (TSS), turbidity, and iron) and the other of diffuse source pollution. The association of the variables like BOD5 and COD at most stations to the run-off-driven parameters revealed their sharing of drivers. On the contrary, separating variables like phosphate (PO43) at the three upstream stations from the run-off patterns suggested their local point-source origin. The DFA-derived factors were later used in the time-point CA to explore the seasonality of water quality parameters and their pollution intensities compared to regulatory levels. The result suggested intensification in wet season of Fe, TSS, BOD5, and COD concentrations at most sites, which are unobservable in run-off detached parameters like reactive nitrogen, phosphate (PO43-), and E. coli. These findings generated robust insights to support water quality management for river habitat conservation.",Cluster analysis; Dynamic factor analysis; River habitat; Water pollution; Water quality management.

262,Art through the Colors of Graffiti: From the Perspective of the Chromatic Structure,"Feitosa-Santana, Claudia; Gaddi, Carlo M.; Gomes, Andreia E.; Nascimento, Sergio M. C.","Graffiti is a general term that describes inscriptions on a wall, a practice with ancient origins, ranging from simple drawings and writings to elaborate pictorial representations. Nowadays, the term graffiti commonly describes the street art dedicated to wall paintings, which raises complex questions, including sociological, legal, political and aesthetic issues. Here we examine the aesthetics of graffiti colors by quantitatively characterizing and comparing their chromatic structure to that of traditional paintings in museums and natural scenes obtained by hyperspectral imaging. Two hundred twenty-eight photos of graffiti were taken in the city of SAo Paulo, Brazil. The colors of graffiti were represented in a color space and characterized by several statistical parameters. We found that graffiti have chromatic structures similar to those of traditional paintings, namely their preferred colors, distribution, and balance. In particular, they have color gamuts with the same degree of elongation, revealing a tendency for combining similar colors in the same proportions. Like more traditional artists, the preferred colors are close to the yellow-blue axis of color space, suggesting that graffiti artists' color choices also mimic those of the natural world. Even so, graffiti tend to have larger color gamuts due to the availability of a new generation of synthetic pigments, resulting in a greater freedom in color choice. A complementary analysis of graffiti from other countries supports the global generalization of these findings. By sharing their color structures with those of paintings, graffiti contribute to bringing art to the cities.",color aesthetics; color statistics; color calibration; cultural heritage and art; graffiti; spectral imaging; street art

264,A Triple-Loop Inductive Power Transmission System for Biomedical Applications,"Lee, Byunghun; Kiani, Mehdi; Ghovanloo, Maysam","A triple-loop wireless power transmission (WPT) system equipped with closed-loop global power control, adaptive transmitter (Tx) resonance compensation (TRC), and automatic receiver (Rx) resonance tuning (ART) is presented. This system not only opposes coupling and load variations but also compensates for changes in the environment surrounding the inductive link to enhance power transfer efficiency (PTE) in applications such as implantable medical devices (IMDs). The Tx was built around a commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) radio-frequency identification (RFID) reader, operating at 13.56 MHz. A local Tx loop finds the optimal capacitance in parallel with the Tx coil by adjusting a varactor. A global power control loop maintains the received power at a desired level in the presence of changes in coupling distance, coil misalignments, and loading. Moreover, a local Rx loop is implemented inside a power management integrated circuit (PMIC) to avoid PTE degradation due to the Rx coil surrounding environment and process variations. The PMIC was fabricated in a 0.35-pm 4M2P standard CMOS process with 2.54 mm(2) active area. Measurement results show that the proposed triple-loop system improves the overall PTE by up to 10.5% and 4.7% compared to a similar open- and single closed-loop system, respectively, at nominal coil distance of 2 cm. The added TRC and ART loops contribute 2.3% and 1.4% to the overall PTE of 13.5%, respectively. This is the first WPT system to include three loops to dynamically compensate for environment and circuit variations and improve the overall power efficiency all the way from the driver output in Tx to the load in Rx.",Adaptive resonance tuning; closed-loop wireless power transmission (WPT); implantable medical devices; radio-frequency identification (RFID); triple-loop power control

Computational investigations reveal that arylation proceeds in a concerted fashion via a 5-membered transition state. The kinetically-controlled regioselectivity for O-arylation-which is reversed relative to previous BiV -mediated pyridone arylations-is attributed primarily to the geometric constraints imposed by the bismacyclic scaffold.",Ambident Nucleophile; Arylation; Bismuth; Density-Functional Calculations; Synthetic Methods.
266,Semantic-Oriented Labeled-to-Unlabeled Distribution Translation for Image Segmentation,"Guo, Xiaoqing; Liu, Jie; Yuan, Yixuan","Automatic medical image segmentation plays a crucial role in many medical applications, such as disease diagnosis and treatment planning. Existing deep learning based models usually regarded the segmentation task as pixel-wise classification and neglected the semantic correlations of pixels across different images, leading to vague feature distribution. Moreover, pixel-wise annotated data is rare in medical domain, and the scarce annotated data usually exhibits the biased distribution against the desired one, hindering the performance improvement under the supervised learning setting. In this paper, we propose a novel Labeled-to-unlabeled Distribution Translation (L2uDT) framework with Semantic-oriented Contrastive Learning (SoCL), mainly for addressing the aforementioned issues in medical image segmentation. In SoCL, a semantic grouping module is designed to cluster pixels into a set of semantically coherent groups, and a semantic-oriented contrastive loss is advanced to constrain group-wise prototypes, so as to explicitly learn a feature space with intra-class compactness and inter-class separability. We then establish a L2uDT strategy to approximate the desired data distribution for unbiased optimization, where we translate the labeled data distribution with the guidance of extensive unlabeled data. In particular, a bias estimator is devised to measure the distribution bias, then a gradual-paced shift is derived to progressively translate the labeled data distribution to unlabeled one. Both labeled and translated data are leveraged to optimize the segmentation model simultaneously. We illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method on two benchmark datasets, EndoScene and PROSTATEx, and our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, which clearly demonstrates its effectiveness for medical image segmentation.

However, spatiotemporally explicit characterization of urban built environment stocks remains hitherto limited, and previous studies on fine-grained mapping of built environment stocks often focus on an urban area without consideration of temporal dynamics. Here, we combined the emerging geospatial data and historical maps to quantify the spatially and temporally refined stocks of buildings and infrastructure and developed a novel indexing method to track the construction, demolition, and renovation for each building across various historical snapshots, with a case study of Odense, Denmark, from 1810 to 2018. We show that built environment stock in Odense increased from 80 t/cap in 1810 to 279 t/cap in 2018. Their dynamics appear overall in line with urban development of Odense over the past two centuries and well reflect the combined effects of industrialization, infrastructure development, socioeconomic characteristics, and policy interventions.

271,An integrated methodology for the study of Atlantic Rock Art,"Valdez-Tullett, Joana","During the Neolithic and Early Bronze Age periods, a specific type of abstract and geometric imagery was being carved on natural outcrops and boulders in the landscapes of western Europe. Often known as Atlantic Rock Art, this prehistoric carving tradition is renowned for its cup-and-ring motifs, cup-marks, wavy grooves and other types of circular imagery. These can be found in the modern countries of Spain, Portugal, Britain and Ireland, where the tradition shares striking similarities. Although these resemblances had been noted in the mid-1950s, they were never fully understood and seldomly studied systematically. This paper offers a discussion on the multi-scalar interdisciplinary methodology used on a large-scale project which studied the phenomenon of Atlantic Rock Art, assessing its similarities and differences between study areas in the aforementioned countries. This approach focused on a number of features of the rock art, extending the investigation beyond the motifs which are obviously similar. The different scales of analysis focused on small details, such as the iconography and carving techniques, followed by a larger scale related to the rock medium, and a final wider scale, that of the landscape in which the carvings are located. The investigation was carried out with a multi-faceted perspective and a combination of methods which included computer modelling for spatial analysis and digital recording techniques, contrasted with more traditional and sensorial/experiential approaches. Results revealed a carving tradition which encompassed many resemblances but was still capable of maintaining unique characters. The study demonstrated the importance of rock art in the narrative of prehistoric Atlantic Europe, contributing to a clearer insight into the connectivity and cultural transmission taking place on the Atlantic seaboard during the Neolithic and Early Bronze Age.",Atlantic rock art; Methodology; Interdisciplinary; Multi-scalar; GIS; Network analysis

Hence, the objective of the study was to research the effect and mechanism of miR-451a in PTC. Differentially expressed miRNAs between GSE113629 and GSE103996 databases were assessed by Venn diagram. miR-451a and its downstream target genes were assessed by RT-PCR and Western blot. The proliferation, invasion, and apoptosis were determined by CCK-8, EdU, transwell, and flow cytometry assays. Dual-luciferase reporter assay were used to evaluated the target of miR-451a. Xenografted tumors was used to explore the function of miR-451a in vivo. Pathological changes and related protein expression were measured by HE staining and immunohistochemistry. MiR-451a was downregulated in PTC tissues and blood, and low expression of miR-451a was related to short overall survival, serious lymph node metastasis and high TNM grade in PTC patients. Moreover, increase of miR-451a restrained the proliferation and invasion and accelerated the apoptosis. Furthermore, miR-451a repressed VEGF signaling pathway. Importantly, miR-451a was demonstrated to target DCBLD2 and AKT1. Overexpression of DCBLD2 and AKT1 could restore the effect of miR-451a on PTC cells. In addition, miR-451a reduced the growth of xenografted tumors in vivo. The data suggested that miR-451a attenuated the proliferation, invasion and promoted apoptosis in PTC cells via inhibiting DCBLD2 and AKT1.",AKT1; DCBLD2; Papillary thyroid cancer; miR-451a.
273,BitCluster: Fine-Grained Weight Quantization for Load-Balanced Bit-Serial Neural Network Accelerators,"Li, Ang; Mo, Huiyu; Zhu, Wenping; Li, Qiang; Yin, Shouyi; Wei, Shaojun; Liu, Leibo","Convolutional neural network (CNN) has demonstrated great success in pattern recognition scenarios at the cost of nearly billions of parameters and consequent convolution operations. Various dedicated hardware designs are proposed to accelerate the CNN computation in more energy-efficient manners. Especially, the bit-serial accelerator (BSA) is one of the most effective approaches on resource-limited platforms by eliminating zero-bit computations. However, the irregular distribution and varying number of effectual (nonzero) bits in weights significantly cause hardware underutilization, impeding further performance improvement of state-of-the-art BSAs. To address this issue, BitCluster, a hardware-friendly quantization method, is proposed to make each weight with the identical number of effectual bits for load-balanced computation. Considering distinct sensitivities to weight precision in different neural layers, layer-level BitCluster is proposed to design further for fine-grained weight quantization. It systematically determines the layerwise quantization configurations, which significantly improve the overall performance with <1% accuracy loss. BitCluster is comprehensively evaluated on a BitCluster-compatible BSA design by taking six mainstream CNN models as benchmarks. The experimental results show that the BitCluster-based BSA achieves 1.6x higher hardware utilization and 3.4x speedup on average than state-of-the-art BSAs, with 5x better energy efficiency on average.",Bit-serial accelerator (BSA); fine-grained quantization; hardware/software co-design; neural network

Nonlinear categorical principal component analysis (NLPCA) was used to lessen 35 variables into 4 sets of uncorrelated components. These four categories are environment-genetic interaction, management, hygiene, and genetic-related factors. Besides, within the two-step cluster analysis, a variable cluster membership was created that identified which family belonged to which cluster. For comparison purpose, hierarchical cluster analysis was used. A two-step cluster analysis results showed that most farms (41.50% and 31.90% in peri-urban and urban areas, respectively, had been in cluster 1 at the same time as most farms (66.70%) of urban areas had been in cluster 2. Overall, most (31.00% and 34.00%) of farms have been in clusters 1 and 2, respectively. Most farms in peri-urban areas had been challenged with scarcity of feed, mastitis, and animal sickness than farms within the urban and rural farming systems. Forming farmer groups as a cooperative to supply offerings together with feed processing devices, artificial insemination, and health services is usually recommended to triumph over such hassle. In addition, on account that it is primarily based on a couple of criteria, the category system evolved in this study depicts a lot better dairy farming systems with admiration to the variety of the components and the relative contribution of each component to dairy farming than do the single-criterion classifications. Hence, the results of such classifications should be seen as a start line from which to efficiently compare the modern extension system and eventually design the high-quality-fit extension models for a heterogeneous populace of smallholder dairy farmers.",Cluster; Dairy; Farming system; Nonlinear; Principal component.

Mya arenaria is located in the taxonomic order Myoida, which lacks any member with a completely annotated mitogenome. The M. arenaria mitochondrial genome is 17 947 bp in length. Like most marine bivalves, the circular mitogenome codes entirely on the heavy strand, with no introns. As with other bivalves, the gene order of the mitochondrion is highly rearranged. The mitogenome contains 12 protein-coding genes but ATP8 is missing, consistent with about half of all bivalve genera. Twenty-three tRNAs were identified. Phylogenetic analysis shows that M. arenaria is related most closely with the bivalves Sinonovacula constricta, and Moerella iridescens, of the infraclass Euheterodonta (unassigned). This, along with the close grouping of the phylogenetic trees, confirms a close tie between Myoida and Euheterodonta (unassigned).","Bivalvia control region, mitogenome, mollusca, phylogeny."

The rationale for quantifying B-lines in pediatric lung diseases,"Niccolò Parri,Marco Allinovi,Martina Giacalone,Iuri Corsini,Niccolò Parri,Marco Allinovi,Martina Giacalone,Iuri Corsini","Lung ultrasound (LUS) is emerging as adjunct tool to be used during clinical assessment. Among the different hallmarks of LUS, B-lines are well known artifacts, which are not correlated with identifiable structures, but which can be used for pathological classification. The presence of multiple B-lines is a sonographic sign of lung interstitial syndrome. It has been demonstrated in adults that there is a direct correlation between the number of B-lines and the severity of the interstitial involvement of lung disease. Counting B-lines is an attempt to enrich the clinical assessment and clinical information, beyond obtaining a simple dichotomous answer. Semiquantitative or quantitative B-line assessment has been shown to correlate with fluid overload and demonstrated prognostic implications in specific neonatal and pediatric conditions. LUS with quantitative B-lines assessment is promising. Current evidence allows for quantification of B-lines in a limited number of neonatal and pediatric diseases.",B-lines; lung ultrasound; pediatrics.
277,Non-Negative Factor Analysis of Gaussian Mixture Model Weight Adaptation for Language and Dialect Recognition,"Bahari, Mohamad Hasan; Dehak, Najim; Van Hamme, Hugo; Burget, Lukas; Ali, Ahmed M.; Glass, Jim","Recent studies show that Gaussian mixture model (GMM) weights carry less, yet complimentary, information to GMM means for language and dialect recognition. However, state-of-the-art language recognition systems usually do not use this information. In this research, a non-negative factor analysis (NFA) approach is developed for GMM weight decomposition and adaptation. This modeling, which is conceptually simple and computationally inexpensive, suggests a new low-dimensional utterance representation method using a factor analysis similar to that of the i-vector framework. The obtained subspace vectors are then applied in conjunction with i-vectors to the language/dialect recognition problem. The suggested approach is evaluated on the NIST 2011 and RATS language recognition evaluation (LRE) corpora and on the QCRI Arabic dialect recognition evaluation (DRE) corpus. The assessment results show that the proposed adaptation method yields more accurate recognition results compared to three conventional weight adaptation approaches, namely maximum likelihood re-estimation, non-negative matrix factorization, and a subspace multinomial model. Experimental results also show that the intermediate-level fusion of i-vectors and NFA subspace vectors improves the performance of the state-of-the-art i-vector framework especially for the case of short utterances.",Non-negative factor analysis; model adaptation; Gaussian mixture model weight; dialect recognition; language recognition

Long learning time caused by its complex structure, however, limits its usage only in high-cost servers or many-core GPU platforms so far. On the other hand, the demand on customized pattern recognition within personal devices will grow gradually as more deep learning applications will be developed. This paper presents a SoC implementation to enable deep learning applications to run with low cost platforms such as mobile or portable devices. Different from conventional works which have adopted massively-parallel architecture, this work adopts task-flexible architecture and exploits multiple parallelism to cover complex functions of convolutional deep belief network which is one of popular deep learning/inference algorithms. In this paper, we implement the most energy-efficient deep learning and inference processor for wearable system.

Two isomers, 4MNVDPP and 6MNVDPP were synthesized and formulated into NPs. 6MNVDPP, which has a larger electrostatic potential difference, exhibits a compact 3D spatial D-A interlocked network in the crystal form, while 4MNVDPP forms 2D D-D type J-aggregates. Thus, 6MNVDPP NPs show red-shifted NIR absorption and larger molar extinction coefficient than 4MNVDPP NPs. Thanks to the typical NIR-II emission, superior photothermal-stability, high photothermal conversion efficiency (89 %) and reactive oxygen species production capacity, 6MNVDPP NPs exhibit outstanding NIR-II tiny capillary vasculature/tumor imaging ability and synergistic photothermal/photodynamic anti-cancer effect in vivo.",3D Spatial D-A Interlocked Network; Molecular Packing; NIR-II Fluorescence Imaging; Phototheranostics; Structural Isomerization.

This system is composed by the cannabinoid receptors, the endogenous ligands, and the enzymes involved in their metabolic processes, which works both centrally and peripherally to regulate a plethora of physiological functions. This review aims at explaining how the site-specific actions of the endocannabinoid system impact on memory and feeding behavior through the cannabinoid receptors 1 (CB1 R). Centrally, CB1 R is widely distributed in many brain regions, different cell types (e.g. neuronal or glial cells) and intracellular compartments (e.g. mitochondria). Interestingly, cellular and molecular effects are differentially mediated by CB1 R according to their cell-type localization (e.g. glutamatergic or GABAergic neurons).

HAR has attracted major interest in the past few years, thanks to the large number of applications enabled by modern ubiquitous computing devices. While several techniques based on hand-crafted feature engineering have been proposed, the current state-of-the-art is represented by deep learning architectures that automatically obtain high level representations and that use recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to extract temporal dependencies in the input. RNNs have several limitations, in particular in dealing with long-term dependencies. We propose a novel deep learning framework, TrASenD, based on a purely attention-based mechanism, that overcomes the limitations of the state-of-the-art. We show that our proposed attention-based architecture is considerably more powerful than previous approaches, with an average increment, of more than 7% on the F1 score over the previous best performing model. Furthermore, we consider the problem of personalizing HAR deep learning models, which is of great importance in several applications. We propose a simple and effective transfer-learning based strategy to adapt a model to a specific user, providing an average increment of 6% on the F1 score on the predictions for that user. Our extensive experimental evaluation proves the significantly superior capabilities of our proposed framework over the current state-of-the-art and the effectiveness of our user adaptation technique.",Sensors; Deep learning; Adaptation models; Data models; Feature extraction; Predictive models; Activity recognition; Activity recognition; deep learning; multimodal sensors; pattern recognition

Despite these behavioral observations, the exact mechanisms underlying these neuroplastic phenomena remain obscure. This gap illustrates the need for carefully designed in-depth studies using valid models and translational tools which allow to uncover the observed events up to the molecular level. We promote the use of in vivo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) because it is a powerful translational imaging technique able to extract functional, structural, and biochemical information from the entire brain. Advanced processing techniques allow performing voxel-based analyses which are capable of detecting novel loci implicated in specific neuroplastic events beyond traditional regions-of-interest analyses. In addition, its non-invasive character sets it as currently the best global imaging tool for performing dynamic longitudinal studies on the same living subject, allowing thus exploring the effects of experience, training, treatment etc. in parallel to additional measures such as age, cognitive performance scores, hormone levels, and many others. The aim of this review is (i) to introduce how different animal models contributed to extend the knowledge on neuroplasticity in both health and disease, over different life stages and upon various experiences, and (ii) to illustrate how specific MRI techniques can be applied successfully to inform on the fundamental mechanisms underlying experience-dependent or activity-induced neuroplasticity including cognitive processes.",Animal; Cognition; Experience; MRI; Neuroplasticity; Training.

Here, for the first time, a TENG shell is advanced for ocean energy harvesting to 0.5 m and an excellent frictional areal density of 1.03 cm-1 and economies of scale are obtained. The unique structure of the multi-arch shape is adopted to untie the difficulty of fully getting the extensive friction layer contact. An inside steel plate is vertically placed in the center of every TENG block, which can activate the TENG to achieve complete contact even at a tilt angle of 7 degrees.

The proposed deep structured residual encoder-decoder network (DSREDN) focuses on two aspects: first, it effectively utilized residual connections throughout the network and provides a wide and deep encoder-decoder path, which results to capture relevant context and more localized features. Second, vanished boundary of detected nuclei is addressed by proposing an efficient loss function that better train our proposed model and reduces the false prediction which is undesirable especially in healthcare applications. The proposed architecture experimented on three different publicly available H&E stained histopathological datasets namely: (I) Kidney (RCC) (II) Triple Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC) (III) MoNuSeg-2018. We have considered F1-score, Aggregated Jaccard Index (AJI), the total number of parameters, and FLOPs (Floating point operations), which are mostly preferred performance measure metrics for comparison of nuclei segmentation. The evaluated score of nuclei segmentation indicated that the proposed architecture achieved a considerable margin over five state-of-the-art deep learning models on three different histopathology datasets.

It is capable of providing quantitative flow values and anatomical information simultaneously. The long acquisition time, however, still inhibits its wider clinical use. Acceleration is achieved at present using parallel MRI (pMRI) techniques which can lead to substantial loss of image quality for higher acceleration factors. Both the high-dimensionality and the significant degree of spatio-temporal correlation in 4-D PCI render it ideally suited for recently proposed compressed sensing (CS) techniques. We propose the Multi-Dimensional Flow-preserving Compressed Sensing (MuFloCoS) method to exploit these properties. A multi-dimensional iterative reconstruction is combined with an interleaved sampling pattern (I-VT), an adaptive masked and weighted temporal regularization (TMW) and fully automatically obtained vessel-masks. The performance of the novel method was analyzed concerning image quality, feasibility of acceleration factors up to 15, quantitative flow values and diagnostic accuracy in phantom experiments and an in vivo carotid study with 18 volunteers. Comparison with iterative state-of-the-art methods revealed significant improvements using the new method, the temporal normalized root mean square error of the peak velocity was reduced by 45.32% for the novel MuFloCoS method with acceleration factor 9. The method was furthermore applied to two patient cases with diagnosed high-grade stenosis of the ICA, which confirmed the performance of MuFloCoS to produce valuable results in the presence of pathological findings in 56 s instead of over 8 min (full sampling).",Compressed sensing; hemodynamics; magnetic resonance imaging (MRI); phase contrast MRI

Then, unstructured and structured neural network (NN) pruning algorithms are proposed to reduce the per-sample computational complexity and the required memory, without compromising their modeling performance. The mathematical equations of the complexity and the memory are derived to analyze the hardware cost and design low cost models. An experimental platform is developed to measure the modeling performance in terms of adjacent channel leakage ratio (ACLR), normalized mean square error, error vector magnitude (EVM) and bit error rate. The platform uses an envelope tracking PA excited by 80 MHz IEEE 802.11ac signals. Compared with the state-of-the-art RNN model in (Sun et (a, 2019), the proposed models reduce the per-sample complexity and required memory by 94-99%, they also improve the ACLR and EVM by at least 3 dB and 1 dB at 0.45 dB and 3.15 dB gain compression, respectively. Furthermore, an observation path with time alignment is used to remove the transmit latency in the state-of-the-art approach. At 3.15 dB gain compression, the proposed models outperform the state-of-the-art feedforward and convolutional NN models by at least 1.3 dB in EVM, outperform the general memory polynomial model by at least 3.3 dB in EVM.

The proposed model, coined as GaitCopy, receives as input a stack of gray images and returns the gait signature of the represented subject. The novel property of this network is that it is not trained to only generate discriminative signatures, but to copy signatures generated by a Master network trained on optical flow inputs. Then, GaitCopy is enforced to extract signatures based on motion and not based on appearance, despite having been trained with pixel inputs. We implement two different versions of GaitCopy, one mainly composed of 3D convolutional layers to capture local temporal information; and a second one based on GaitSet which uses 2D convolutional layers under a temporal setup. We evaluate our approach on two public gait datasets: CASIA-B and TUM-GAID. We observe that compact networks, up to x4:2 smaller for TUM-GAID, can be obtained by using our approach, while keeping a competitive recognition accuracy with respect to the state of the art, and without the need of explicit optical flow computation.

In this study, musculoskeletal modelling was used to estimate fibre mechanics of four hamstring (biceps femoris long head, biceps femoris short head, semimembranosus and semitendinosus) and four adductor (adductor brevis, adductor longus, adductor magnus and gracilis) muscles during an anticipated cut task. The cut task was performed by 10 healthy elite male U20 basketball players both before and immediately after they played in one (of four) competitive basketball game. Biceps femoris long head produced significantly lower (p = 0.032) submaximal force post-game in the latter part of swing (30.7% to 35.0% of stride), though its peak force occurred later (37%) and remained unchanged. Semimembranosus produced significantly lower (p = 0.006) force post-game (32.9% to 44.9% of stride), which encompassed the instance of peak force (39%). Neither fibre velocity nor fibre length of the investigated muscles were significantly affected by game-play. These finding suggest that if fatigue is a factor in hamstring and adductor muscle strain injuries and is brought about by game-play, it is unlikely through the fibre mechanisms investigated in this study.",Musculoskeletal modelling; cumulative trauma disorders; forces; strain.

Kevin; Hammon, Matthias; Seifert, Sascha; Huber, Martin; Comaniciu, Dorin; Hornegger, Joachim; Cavallaro, Alexander","Being able to segment the esophagus without user interaction from 3-D CT data is of high value to radiologists during oncological examinations of the mediastinum. The segmentation can serve as a guideline and prevent confusion with pathological tissue. However, limited contrast to surrounding structures and versatile shape and appearance make segmentation a challenging problem. This paper presents a multistep method. First, a detector that is trained to learn a discriminative model of the appearance is combined with an explicit model of the distribution of respiratory and esophageal air. In the next step, prior shape knowledge is incorporated using a Markov chain model. We follow a ""detect and connect"" approach to obtain the maximum a posteriori estimate of the approximate esophagus shape from hypothesis about the esophagus contour in axial image slices. Finally, the surface of this approximation is nonrigidly deformed to better fit the boundary of the organ. The method is compared to an alternative approach that uses a particle filter instead of a Markov chain to infer the approximate esophagus shape, to the performance of a human observer and also to state of the art methods, which are all semiautomatic. Cross-validation on 144 CT scans showed that the Markov chain based approach clearly outperforms the particle filter. It segments the esophagus with a mean error of 1.80 mm in less than 16 s on a standard PC. This is only 1 mm above the interobserver variability and can compete with the results of previously published semiautomatic methods.",Esophagus; Markov chain; segmentation; tracking; tubular structure

The state-of-the-art method is based on semidefinite relaxation (SDR), which possibly returns a high-rank solution and makes it difficult to recover a robustly feasible solution. To overcome this drawback, we propose an efficient algorithm for solving the robust fractional QCQP by employing the constrained concave-convex procedure and the cutting set method. When finding a robustly feasible initial point is nontrivial, we propose an effective method to deal with it. We also develop the parallel implementation of the proposed algorithm to speed up the computation aiming for real-time application scenarios. As a case study, in the second part of the paper we focus on two examples, namely: i) a novel robust nonorthogonal multiple access (NOMA) multiuser beamforming for physical layer security; and ii) the renowned robust signal-to-interference-and-noise ratio (SINR) balancing problem of cognitive radio multiuser beamforming systems.

The calculation becomes more complex and the convergence becomes slower during training because of the pre-processed images. The proposed DCDRN invents a simple and effective method which processes the original image directly and the optimization of layers and filters of CNNs shorten the cost of training significantly. Experiments on benchmark datasets with different methods show that DCDRN achieves gratifying performance against state-of-the-art methods.

The cation solvation structure dictated by electrolyte chemistry plays a critical role in the SEIs properties. While a relatively weak cation-solvent binding is preferred in Li metal anodes to promote anion-derived SEIs, we demonstrate an enhanced Ca deposition/stripping reversibility under a strong cation-solvent interaction, which is materialized in strongly-solvating solvent and highly-dissociated salt combinations. Such electrolyte formulations benefit the formation of solvent-occupied solvation structure and minimize the anion reduction, resulting in organic-rich/CaF2 -poor SEIs for reversible Ca metal anodes. Furthermore, RCMBs paired with an organic cathode using the optimized electrolytes are demonstrated as a proof-of-concept. Our work reveals the paradigm shift in SEIs design for Ca metal anodes, opening up new opportunities for emerging RCMBs.",Ca Deposition/Stripping; Electrolyte Formulation; Solid Electrolyte Interphase; Solvation Structure.
296,"ARTFLOW: A Fast, Biologically Inspired Neural Network that Learns Optic Flow Templates for Self-Motion Estimation","Layton, Oliver W.","Most algorithms for steering, obstacle avoidance, and moving object detection rely on accurate self-motion estimation, a problem animals solve in real time as they navigate through diverse environments. One biological solution leverages optic flow, the changing pattern of motion experienced on the eye during self-motion. Here I present ARTFLOW, a biologically inspired neural network that learns patterns in optic flow to encode the observer's self-motion. The network combines the fuzzy ART unsupervised learning algorithm with a hierarchical architecture based on the primate visual system. This design affords fast, local feature learning across parallel modules in each network layer. Simulations show that the network is capable of learning stable patterns from optic flow simulating self-motion through environments of varying complexity with only one epoch of training. ARTFLOW trains substantially faster and yields self-motion estimates that are far more accurate than a comparable network that relies on Hebbian learning. I show how ARTFLOW serves as a generative model to predict the optic flow that corresponds to neural activations distributed across the network.",optic flow; heading; self-motion; neural decoding; adaptive resonance theory; vision; biologically inspired; neural network
297,Detection of 18-methyl steroids: Case report on a forensic urine sample and corresponding dietary supplements,"Detlef Thieme,Patricia Anielski,Sebastian Rzeppa,Clemens A Wolf,Gerhard Wolber,Annekathrin M Keiler,Detlef Thieme,Patricia Anielski,Sebastian Rzeppa,Clemens A Wolf,Gerhard Wolber,Annekathrin M Keiler","The detection of a putative 18-methyl-19-nortestosterone metabolite in a forensic bodybuilder's urine sample collected as part of a criminal proceeding has triggered a follow-up investigation. Four different dietary supplements in the possession of the suspect were examined with regard to possible precursor steroids. This led to the detection of the declared ingredient methoxydienone, which was confirmed by both, GC-MSMS and LC-HRMSMS. As neither 18-methyl-testosterone, nor 18-methyl-19-nortestosterone were detectable in the supplements, the possibility that the metabolite originates from methoxydienone was investigated. For this purpose, the metabolic fate of methoxydienone was studied in vitro using human HepG2 cells and in vivo by a single oral administration. While the 18-methyl-19-nortestosterone metabolite was not generated by HepG2 cells incubated with methoxydienone, it was observed in the urine samples collected at 2, 6, 10 and 24 h after methoxydienone administration. Moreover, the potential binding of methoxydienone as ligand to the human androgen receptor was modelled in silico in comparison with 18-methylnandrolone, for which androgen receptor activation had been shown in an in vitro approach before. In conclusion, we could ascribe the presence of the 18-methyl-19-nortestosterone metabolite in a forensic urine sample to originate from methoxydienone present in dietary supplements. Methoxydienone was observed to slowly degrade by demethylation of the methoxy substituent in liquid solutions. While no compound-specific intermediates were identified that allowed differentiation from other 18-methyl steroids, the 18-methyl-19-nortestosterone metabolite proved to be a suitable marker for reliable detection in doping analysis.",18-methyl steroids; doping analysis; methoxydienone; molecular modelling; nutritional supplements.

Specially, TIPCA alternately aligns the image ensemble and creates the optimal eigenspace, with the objective to minimize the mean square error between the aligned images and their reconstructions. The learning from the FERET facial image ensemble of 1,196 subjects validates the mutual promotion between image alignment and eigenspace representation, which eventually leads to the optimized coding and recognition performance that surpasses the handcrafted alignment based on facial landmarks. Experimental results also suggest that state-of-the-art invariant descriptors, such as local binary pattern (LBP), histogram of oriented gradient (HOG), and Gabor energy filter (GEF), and classification methods, such as sparse representation based classification (SRC) and support vector machine (SVM), can benefit from using the TIPCA-aligned faces, instead of the manually eye-aligned faces that are widely regarded as the ground-truth alignment.

New semiconductor process technologies have the potential to integrate ever greater functional complexity onto realistically priced silicon chips. Yet there still remains a significant design gap between what can theoretically be integrated onto silicon and what can be efficiently designed onto it. in addition, the advent of sub-100-nm process technologies has seen an end to the speed and power consumption scaling that the industry has been used to. This paper examines the current state of the art in SoC technology and identifies some of the challenges that lie ahead if the relentless progress of Moore's Law is to continue fuelling ever more advanced and affordable consumer electronics products. it also looks at the system-in-package solutions that are increasingly being used to achieve levels of functional integration that Moore's Law on its own cannot provide.",complimentary metal-oxide-semiconductor; embedded systems; integrated circuit design; integrated circuit process technology; IPReUse; system-in-package (SiP); system-on-chip (SoC)

Air travel has become a major focus point with respect to reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The electrification of aircraft components can bring several benefits such as reduced mass, environmental impact, fuel consumption, increased reliability and quicker failure resolution. Propulsion, actuation and power generation are the three key areas of focus in more electric aircraft technologies, due to the increasing demand for power-dense, efficient and fault-tolerant flight components. The necessity of having environmentally friendly aircraft systems has promoted the aerospace industry to use electrically powered drive systems, rather than the conventional mechanical, pneumatic or hydraulic systems. In this context, this paper reviews the current state of art and future advances in more electric technologies, in conjunction with a number of industrially relevant discussions. In this study, a permanent magnet motor was identified as the most efficient machine for aircraft subsystems. It is found to be 78% and 60% more power dense than switch-reluctant and induction machines. Several development methods to close the gap between existing and future design were also analysed, including the embedded cooling system, high-thermal-conductivity insulation materials, thin-gauge and high-strength electrical steel and integrated motor drive topology.",more electric aircraft; electrical machine; actuation; power generation; propulsion; aircraft electrification
303,ResViT: Residual Vision Transformers for Multimodal Medical Image Synthesis,"Dalmaz, Onat; Yurt, Mahmut; Cukur, Tolga","Generative adversarial models with convolutional neural network (CNN) backbones have recently been established as state-of-the-art in numerous medical image synthesis tasks. However, CNNs are designed to perform local processing with compact filters, and this inductive bias compromises learning of contextual features. Here, we propose a novel generative adversarial approach for medical image synthesis, ResViT, that leverages the contextual sensitivity of vision transformers along with the precision of convolution operators and realism of adversarial learning. ResViT's generator employs a central bottleneck comprising novel aggregated residual transformer (ART) blocks that synergistically combine residual convolutional and transformer modules. Residual connections in ART blocks promote diversity in captured representations, while a channel compression module distills task-relevant information. A weight sharing strategy is introduced among ART blocks to mitigate computational burden. A unified implementation is introduced to avoid the need to rebuild separate synthesis models for varying source-target modality configurations. Comprehensive demonstrations are performed for synthesizing missing sequences in multi-contrast MRI, and CT images from MRI. Our results indicate superiority of ResViT against competing CNN- and transformer-based methods in terms of qualitative observations and quantitative metrics.",Transformers; Biomedical imaging; Subspace constraints; Task analysis; Image synthesis; Magnetic resonance imaging; Computer architecture; Medical image synthesis; transformer; residual; vision; adversarial; generative; unified

The solubility of tadalafil in mixed solution of hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin (HPCD), polyethylene glycol (PEG) 400 and tween 80 (T2 solution) was 260.8 ± 4.3 µg/mL and that of tadalafil in modified T2 (M-T2) solution, which tadalafil was dissolved in 20% (w/v) HPCD at first and then mixture solutions of PEG 400 and tween 80 were added, was increased to 344.9 ± 30.6 µg/mL.

A dynamic MR image reconstruction method from partial (k, t)-space measurements is introduced that recovers and inherently separates the information in the dynamic scene. The reconstruction model is based on a low-rank plus sparse decomposition prior, which is related to robust principal component analysis. An algorithm is proposed to solve the convex optimization problem based on an alternating direction method of multipliers. The method is validated with numerical phantom simulations and cardiac MRI data against state of the art dynamic MRI reconstruction methods. Results suggest that using the proposed approach as a means of regularizing the inverse problem remains competitive with state of the art reconstruction techniques.

However, the biological processes regulated by EV71 remain poorly understood. Herein, proteomics and metabonomics studies were conducted to uncover the mechanism of EV71 infection in rhabdomyosarcoma (RD) cells and identify potential drug targets. Differential expressed proteins from enriched membrane were analyzed by isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ)-based proteomics technology. Twenty-six differential proteins with 1.5-fold (p < 0.05) change were detected, including 14 upregulated proteins and 12 downregulated proteins. The upregulated proteins are mainly involved in metabolic process, especially in the glycolysis pathway. Alpha-enolase (ENO1) protein was found to increase with temporal dependence following EV71 infection. The targeted metabolomics analysis revealed that glucose absorption and glycolysis metabolites were increased after EV71 infection. The glycolysis pathway was inhibited by knocking down ENO1 or the use of a glycolysis inhibitor (dichloroacetic acid [DCA]); and we found that EV71 infection was inhibited by depleting ENO1 or using DCA. Our study indicates that EV71 may reprogram glucose metabolism by activating glycolysis, and EV71 infection can be inhibited by interrupting the glycolysis pathway. ENO1 may be a potential target against EV71, and DCA could act as an inhibitor of EV71.",Enterovirus A71; LC-MS; alpha-enolase; iTRAQ; metabolomics; plasma membrane; proteomics.
307,A Dual-Attention Autoencoder Network for Efficient Recommendation System,"Duan, Chao; Sun, Jianwen; Li, Kaiqi; Li, Qing","Accelerated development of mobile networks and applications leads to the exponential expansion of resources, which causes problems such as trek and overload of information. One of the practical approaches to ease these problems is recommendation systems (RSs) that can provide individualized service. Video recommendation is one of the most critical recommendation services. However, achieving satisfactory recommendation service on the sparse data is difficult for video recommendation service. Moreover, the cold start problem further exacerbates the research challenge. Recent state-of-the-art works attempted to solve this problem by utilizing the user and item information from some other perspective. However, the significance of user and item information changes under different applications. This paper proposes an autoencoder model to improve recommendation efficiency by utilizing attribute information and implementing the proposed algorithm for video recommendation. In the proposed model, we first extract the user features and the video features by combining the user attribute and the video category information simultaneously. Then, we integrate the attention mechanism into the extracted features to generate the vital features. Finally, we incorporate the user and item potential factor to generate the probability matrix and defines the user-item rating matrix using the factorized probability matrix. Experimental results on two shared datasets demonstrates that the proposed model can effectively ameliorate video recommendation quality compared with the state-of-the-art methods.",recommendation system; matrix factorization; attention mechanism; autoencoder; collaborative filtering

On the basis of the international state of the art, from the current regulatory context to existing approaches, the ERICA method has been identified as fully consistent with the ICRP approach and the most operational at the moment, due to its richness, flexibility and traceability. Most of the radiological risk assessments for wildlife published in the 5 last years used part or all of the ERICA approach, generally screening the radiological risk for wildlife from the first stage of the assessment, except for a few areas among those most impacted by radioactive contamination (Chernobyl area, uranium mining sites in Central Asia, etc.).

310,Evolving Type-2 Fuzzy Classifier,"Pratama, Mahardhika; Lu, Jie; Zhang, Guangquan","Evolving fuzzy classifiers (EFCs) have achieved immense success in dealing with nonstationary data streams because of their flexible characteristics. Nonetheless, most real-world data streams feature highly uncertain characteristics, which cannot be handled by the type-1 EFC. A novel interval type-2 fuzzy classifier, namely evolving type-2 classifier (eT2Class), is proposed in this paper, which constructs an evolving working principle in the framework of interval type-2 fuzzy system. The eT2Class commences its learning process from scratch with an empty or initially trained rule base, and its fuzzy rules can be automatically grown, pruned, recalled, and merged on the fly referring to summarization power and generalization power of data streams. In addition, the eT2Class is driven by a generalized interval type-2 fuzzy rule, where the premise part is composed of the multivariate Gaussian function with an uncertain nondiagonal covariance matrix, while employing a subset of the nonlinear Chebyshev polynomial as the rule consequents. The efficacy of the eT2Class has been rigorously assessed by numerous real-world and artificial study cases, bench-marked against state-of-the-art classifiers, and validated through various statistical tests. Our numerical results demonstrate that the eT2Class produces more reliable classification rates, while retaining more compact and parsimonious rule base than state-of-the-art EFCs recently published in the literature.",Evolving neurofuzzy system; extreme learning machine; fuzzy neural network; metacognitive learning; sequential learning

However, deploying state-of-the-art deep learning (DL) models for this task on memory-constrained and battery-operated edge devices, such as wearables, requires a careful optimization process, both at design time, with an appropriate tuning of the DL models' architectures, and at execution time, where the execution of large and computationally complex models should be avoided unless strictly needed. In this work, we pursue both optimization targets, proposing a novel gesture recognition system that improves upon the state-of-the-art models both in terms of accuracy and efficiency. At the level of DL model architecture, we apply for the first time tiny transformer models (which we call bioformers) to sEMG-based gesture recognition. Through an extensive architecture exploration, we show that our most accurate bioformer achieves a higher classification accuracy on the popular Non-Invasive Adaptive hand Prosthetics Database 6 (Ninapro DB6) dataset compared to the state-of-the-art convolutional neural network (CNN) TEMPONet (+3.1%). When deployed on the RISC-V-based low-power system-on-chip (SoC) GAP8, bioformers that outperform TEMPONet in accuracy consume 7.8x-44.5x less energy per inference. At runtime, we propose a three-level dynamic inference approach that combines a shallow classifier, i.e., a random forest (RF) implementing a simple ""rest detector"" with two bioformers of different accuracy and complexity, which are sequentially applied to each new input, stopping the classification early for ""easy"" data. With this mechanism, we obtain a flexible inference system, capable of working in many different operating points in terms of accuracy and average energy consumption.

Baek et al. (Journal of Experimental Education, 90(4), 934-961, 2022) identified several statistical issues that arise when researchers fail to model multiple DVs in meta-analyses of SCED data. However, the degree to which non-modeling of multiple DVs impacts the results of the meta-analysis of SCED has not been fully examined. In this simulation study, we have systematically investigated the impact of non-modeling of multiple DVs when analyzing meta SCED data using multilevel modeling. The result demonstrates that modeling multiple DVs has advantages over the non-modeling option for meta-analysis of SCED. Modeling multiple DVs enables the determination of precise effects from different DVs in addition to the unbiased and accurate average effect and accurate estimates and inferences for the error variances at the study level as well as the observation level. The current study also reveals potential factors (i.e., the number of DVs, degree of heterogeneity in the level-1 error variances and autocorrelation, and presence of the moderator effect) that impact the precision and accuracy of the variance parameters.",Heterogeneous error structure; Meta-analysis; Moderator analysis; Multilevel modeling; Multiple dependent variables; Single-case experimental design.

Here we study how catecholaminergic hormones regulate rapid colour change in explosive breeding toads (Duttaphrynus melanostictus), where large groups of males gather and quickly change their colour from brown to bright yellow during reproduction. We find that both epinephrine (EP) and/or norepinephrine (NE) cause the toads' skin to become yellow in minutes, even in the absence of social and environmental cues associated with explosive breeding. We hypothesize that natural selection drives the evolution of rapid colour change by co-opting the functional effects of catecholaminergic action. If so, then hormones involved in 'fight or flight' responses may mechanistically facilitate the emergence of dynamic visual signals that mediate communication in a sexual context.",Asian common toad; Duttaphrynus melanostictus; dynamic dichromatism‌; epinephrine; norepinephrine; vision model.
316,A Linear Encoding Approach to Index Assignment in Lossy Source-Channel Coding,"Fresia, Maria; Caire, Giuseppe","We present a general scheme for the lossy transmission of a source with arbitrary statistics through a noisy channel under the mean-square error fidelity criterion. Our approach is based on transform coding, scalar quantization of the transform coefficients and linear encoding of the quantization indices. Entropy coding and channel coding are merged into a single linear encoding function, such that the ""catastrophic"" behavior of conventional entropy coding is avoided and the full power of modern coding techniques and iterative ""Belief-Propagation"" decoding can be exploited. We show that this approach is asymptotically optimal in the limit of large block length, for arbitrary source statistics and binary-input output-symmetric channel. In the practical regime of finite block length and low decoding complexity, we show, through the explicit construction of codes for the lossy transmission of digital images over a binary symmetric channel, that our approach yields significant improvements with respect to previously proposed channel-optimized quantization schemes and also with respect to the conventional concatenation of state-of-the art image coding with state-of-the art channel coding.

They often rely on microelectrode arrays, which are limited by their ability to cover large cortical surface areas and long-term stability because of their physical size and rigid configuration. Yet some clinical and research applications prioritize a distributed neural interface over one that offers high channel count. One solution to make large scale, fully specifiable, electrical stimulation/recording possible, is to disconnect the electrodes from the base, so that they can be arbitrarily placed freely in the nervous system. In this work, a wirelessly powered stimulating implant is miniaturized using a novel electrode integration technique, and its implanted depth maximized using new optimization design methods for the transmitter and receiver coils. The stimulating device is implemented in a 130nm CMOS technology with the following characteristics: 300m 300m 80m size; optimized two-coil inductive link; and integrated circuit, electrodes and coil. The wireless and stimulation capability of the implant is demonstrated in a conductive medium, as well as in-vivo. To the best of our knowledge, the fabricated free-floating miniaturized implant has the best depth-to-volume ratio making it an excellent tool for minimally-invasive distributed neural interface, and thus could eventually complement or replace the rigid arrays that are currently the state-of-the-art in brain set-ups.",Coils; Implants; Electrodes; Resonant frequency; Wireless communication; Capacitors; Optimization; Free-floating implant; miniaturization; microelectrode design; neural stimulation; wireless power transfer

The outcome of studied literature reveals that there is still much work to be done in the improvement of assistive exoskeletons in terms of their technological aspects, such as choosing proper and effective control methods, developing user friendly interfaces, and decreasing the costs of device to make it more affordable, meanwhile ensuring safe interaction for the end-users.",Lower limb assistance; actuation; exoskeleton; wearable robots; mechanism design; elderly
320,Using recursive ART network to construction domain ontology based on term frequency and inverse document frequency,"Chen, Rung-Ching; Liang, Jui-Yuan; Pan, Ren-Hao","Ontology describes data about data and offers a group of glossaries with a definition that encompasses them in their entire. It not only transfers syntax of words but also accurately transfers semantic data between human users and the network. Hence, the usefulness of the semantic web depends on whether the domain ontology can be constructed effectively and correctly. In this paper we propose an automated method to construct the domain ontology. First, we collected domain-related web pages from the Internet. Secondly, we use the HTML tag labels to choose meaningful terms from the web pages. Next, we use these terms to construct the domain ontology by calculating a TF-IDF to find the weight of terms, using a recursive ART network (Adaptive Resonance Theory Network) to cluster terms. Each group of terms will find a candidate keyword for ontology construction. Boolean operations locate individual keywords in a hierarchy. Finally, the system outputs an ontology in a Jena package using an RDF format. The primary experiment indicates that our method is useful for domain ontology creation. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

321,A Fast Algorithm for Fractional QCQP and Applications to Secure Beamforming in Cognitive Nonorthogonal Multiple Access Networks,"Luo, Hualiang; Li, Quanzhong; Yang, Liang; Qin, Jiayin","In this paper, we investigate a nonconvex fractional quadratically constrained quadratic problem (fractional QCQP), which has a wide application to the resource allocation optimization in wireless communication systems. Different from the state-of-the-art methods needing to solve semidefinite programmings or second-order cone programmings, we propose a fast algorithm for solving fractional QCQP by combining the successive convex approximation method and the consensus alternating direction method of multipliers, which has only simple computations and works very fast in applications with modest accuracy. We also apply the proposed fast algorithm to secure beamforming design for enhancing physical layer security in cognitive nonorthogonal multiple access (NOMA) networks, where secrecy rate optimization problems in both underlay and overly cognitive NOMA networks are typical fractional QCQPs and have not been well studied. Simulation results have shown that our proposed fast algorithm achieves almost the same performance as the state-of-the-art methods, however, the proposed fast algorithm has very low computation complexity.",NOMA; Signal processing algorithms; Optimization; Array signal processing; Programming; Resource management; Multicast communication; Fractional quadratically constrained quadratic problem (Fractional QCQP); fast algorithm; secure beamforming; cognitive radios; nonorthogonal multiple access
322,An Efficient Topological Distance-Based Tree Kernel,"Aiolli, Fabio; Da San Martino, Giovanni; Sperduti, Alessandro","Tree kernels proposed in the literature rarely use information about the relative location of the substructures within a tree. As this type of information is orthogonal to the one commonly exploited by tree kernels, the two can be combined to enhance state-of-the-art accuracy of tree kernels. In this brief, our attention is focused on subtree kernels. We describe an efficient algorithm for injecting positional information into a tree kernel and present ways to enlarge its feature space without affecting its worst case complexity. The experimental results on several benchmark datasets are presented showing that our method is able to reach state-of-the-art performances, obtaining in some cases better performance than computationally more demanding tree kernels.",Kernel methods; kernels for structured data; learning in structured domains; position aware kernels; tree kernels

Assessment results were compared among five models, and comparisons of model predictions with actual measurements were also made. Assessments were performed using both probabilistic and deterministic approaches. Predicted dose distributions for indoor and outdoor workers from a probabilistic approach were in good agreement with the actual measurements. In addition, when the models were applied to assess the doses to the representative person, based on a concept recommended by the International Commission on Radiological Protection and in the International Atomic Energy Agency Safety Standards, it was evident that doses to the representative person obtained with a deterministic approach were always higher than those obtained with a probabilistic approach using the same model.",urban environments; dose assessment; representative person

Hence, the medicinal importance of Cyt C as catalytic defense is immensely important in various mitochondrial disorders. Here, we have developed a nanomaterial via electrostatically conjugating oxidized single-wall carbon nanotube with Cyt C (Cyt C@cSWCNT) for the exogenous delivery of Cyt C. The chemical and morphological characterization of the developed Cyt C@cSWCNT was done using UV-vis, FTIR, XPS, powder XRD, TGA/DSC, TEM, etc. The developed Cyt C@cSWCNT exhibited bifunctional catalase and peroxidase activity with Km (∼ 642.7 μM and 351.6 μM) and Vmax (∼0.33 μM/s and 2.62 μM/s) values, respectively. Also, through this conjugation Cyt C was found to retain its catalytic activity even at 60 °C, excellent catalytic recyclability (at least up to 3 times), and wider pH activity (pH = 3 to 9). Cyt C@cSWCNT was found to promote intracellular ROS quenching and maintain mitochondrial membrane potential and cellular membrane integrity via Na+/K+ ion homeostasis during the H2O2 stress. Overall the present strategy provides an alternative approach for the exogenous delivery of Cyt C which can be used as nano catalytic medicine.",Cell membrane integrity; Cytochrome C; Exogenous delivery; Intracellular ROS; Nanoenzyme; Single-walled carbon nanotube.

In this paper, we present an embedded solution for real-time EMG-based hand gesture recognition. The work focuses on the multi-level design of the system, integrating the hardware and software components to develop a wearable device capable of acquiring and processing EMG signals for real-time gesture recognition. The system combines the accuracy of a custom analog front end with the flexibility of a low power and high performance microcontroller for on-board processing. Our system achieves the same accuracy of high-end and more expensive active EMG sensors used in applications with strict requirements on signal quality. At the same time, due to its flexible configuration, it can be compared to the few wearable platforms designed for EMG gesture recognition available on market. We demonstrate that we reach similar or better performance while embedding the gesture recognition on board, with the benefit of cost reduction. To validate this approach, we collected a dataset of 7 gestures from 4 users, which were used to evaluate the impact of the number of EMG channels, the number of recognized gestures and the data rate on the recognition accuracy and on the computational demand of the classifier. As a result, we implemented a SVM recognition algorithm capable of real-time performance on the proposed wearable platform, achieving a classification rate of 90%, which is aligned with the state-of-the-art off-line results and a 29.7 mW power consumption, guaranteeing 44 hours of continuous operation with a 400 mAh battery.",Electromyography (EMG); gesture recognition; wearable device
326,Deep 1D Landmark Representation Learning for Space Target Pose Estimation,"Liu, Shengli; Zhu, Xiaowen; Cao, Zewei; Wang, Gang","Monocular vision-based pose estimation for known uncooperative space targets plays an increasingly important role in on-orbit operations. The existing state-of-the-art methods of space target pose estimation build the 2D-3D correspondences to recover the space target pose, where space target landmark regression is a key component of the methods. The 2D heatmap representation is the dominant descriptor in landmark regression. However, its quantization error grows dramatically under low-resolution input conditions, and extra post-processing is usually needed to compute the accurate 2D pixel coordinates of landmarks from heatmaps. To overcome the aforementioned problems, we propose a novel 1D landmark representation that encodes the horizontal and vertical pixel coordinates of a landmark as two independent 1D vectors. Furthermore, we also propose a space target landmark regression network to regress the locations of landmarks in the image using 1D landmark representations. Comprehensive experiments conducted on the SPEED dataset show that the proposed 1D landmark representation helps the proposed space target landmark regression network outperform existing state-of-the-art methods at various input resolutions, especially at low resolutions. Based on the 2D landmarks predicted by the proposed space target landmark regression network, the error of space target pose estimation is also smaller than existing state-of-the-art methods under all input resolution conditions.",pose estimation; landmark regression; space target; 1D landmark representation; deep learning
327,Effects of PM2.5 on Third Grade Students' Proficiency in Math and English Language Arts,"Mullen, Casey; Grineski, Sara E.; Collins, Timothy W.; Mendoza, Daniel L.","Fine particulate air pollution is harmful to children in myriad ways. While evidence is mounting that chronic exposures are associated with reduced academic proficiency, no research has examined the frequency of peak exposures. It is also unknown if pollution exposures influence academic proficiency to the same degree in all schools or if the level of children's social disadvantage in schools modifies the effects, such that some schools' academic proficiency levels are more sensitive to exposures. We address these gaps by examining the percentage of third grade students who tested below the grade level in math and English language arts (ELA) in Salt Lake County, Utah primary schools (n = 156), where fine particulate pollution is a serious health threat. More frequent peak exposures were associated with reduced math and ELA proficiency, as was greater school disadvantage. High frequency peak exposures were more strongly linked to lower math proficiency in more advantaged schools. Findings highlight the need for policies to reduce the number of days with peak air pollution.",air pollution; PM2; 5; environmental justice; primary schools; academic proficiency; Salt Lake County; Utah

Efficient load forecasting for future demands can minimize the gap which will help in economic power generation, power operations, power construction planning and power distribution. Nowadays, neural networks are widely used for solving load forecasting problem due to its non-linear characteristics. Consequently, neural network is successfully combined with optimization techniques for finding optimal network parameters in order to reduce the forecasting error. In this paper, firstly a novel evolutionary algorithm based on follow the leader concept is developed and thereafter its performance is validated by COmparing Continuous Optimizers experimental framework on the set of 24 Black-Box Optimization Benchmarking functions with 12 state-of-art algorithms in 2-D, 3-D, 5-D, 10-D, and 20-D. The proposed algorithm outperformed all state-of-art algorithms in 20-D and ranked second in other dimensions. Further, the proposed algorithm is integrated with neural network for the proper tuning of network parameters to solve the real world problem of short term load forecasting.

Recent years have witnessed a rapid increase of EA approaches, yet the relative performance of them remains unclear, partly due to the incomplete empirical evaluations, as well as the fact that comparisons were carried out under different settings (i.e., datasets, information used as input, etc.). In this paper, we fill in the gap by conducting a comprehensive evaluation and detailed analysis of state-of-the-art EA approaches. We first propose a general EA framework that encompasses all the current methods, and then group existing methods into three major categories. Next, we judiciously evaluate these solutions on a wide range of use cases, based on their effectiveness, efficiency and robustness. Finally, we construct a new EA dataset to mirror the real-life challenges of alignment, which were largely overlooked by existing literature. This study strives to provide a clear picture of the strengths and weaknesses of current EA approaches, so as to inspire quality follow-up research.",Task analysis; Erbium; Robustness; Mirrors; Benchmark testing; Training; Natural languages
330,Chord Recognition by Fitting Rescaled Chroma Vectors to Chord Templates,"Oudre, Laurent; Grenier, Yves; Fevotte, Cedric","In this paper, we propose a simple and fast method for chord recognition in music signals. We extract a chromagram from the signal which transcribes the harmonic content of the piece over time. We introduce a set of chord templates taking into account one or more harmonics of the pitch notes of the chord and calculate a scale parameter to fit the chromagram frames to these chords templates. Several chord types (major, minor, dominant seventh, etc.) are considered. The detected chord over a frame is the one minimizing a measure of fit between the rescaled chroma vector and the chord templates. Several popular distances and divergences from the signal processing or probability fields are considered for our task. Our system is improved by some post-processing filtering that modifies the recognition criteria so as to favor time-persistence. The transcription tool is evaluated on three corpora: the Beatles corpus used for MIREX 08, a 20-audio-song corpus, and a resynthesized MIDI corpus. Our system is also compared to state-of-the-art chord recognition methods. Experimental results show that our method compares favorably to the state-of-the-art and is less computationally demanding than the other evaluated systems.

However, the critical intracellular molecules that orchestrate neuroprotective functions of microglia remain poorly understood. In our studies, we find that targeted deletion of SYK in microglia leads to exacerbated Aβ deposition, aggravated neuropathology, and cognitive defects in the 5xFAD mouse model of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Disruption of SYK signaling in this AD model was further shown to impede the development of disease-associated microglia (DAM), alter AKT/GSK3β-signaling, and restrict Aβ phagocytosis by microglia. Conversely, receptor-mediated activation of SYK limits Aβ load. We also found that SYK critically regulates microglial phagocytosis and DAM acquisition in demyelinating disease.

332,Minimum Mean-Square Error Estimation of Mel-Frequency Cepstral Features-A Theoretically Consistent Approach,"Jensen, Jesper; Tan, Zheng-Hua","In this work, we consider the problem of feature enhancement for noise-robust automatic speech recognition (ASR). We propose a method for minimum mean-square error (MMSE) estimation of mel-frequency cepstral features, which is based on a minimum number of well-established, theoretically consistent statistical assumptions. More specifically, the method belongs to the class of methods relying on the statistical framework proposed in Ephraim and Malah's original work (""Speech enhancement using a minimum mean-square error short-time spectral amplitude estimator,"" IEEE Trans. Acoust., Speech, Signal Process., vol. ASSP-32, no. 6, 1984). The method is general in that it allows MMSE estimation of mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC's), cepstral-mean subtracted (CMS-) MFCC's, autoregressive-moving-average (ARMA)-filtered CMS-MFCC's, velocity, and acceleration coefficients. In addition, the method is easily modified to take into account other compressive non-linearities than the logarithm traditionally used for MFCC computation. In terms of MFCC estimation performance, as measured by MFCC mean-square error, the proposed method shows performance which is identical to or better than other state-of-the-art methods. In terms of ASR performance, no statistical difference could be found between the proposed method and the state-of-the-art methods. We conclude that existing state-of-the-art MFCC feature enhancement algorithms within this class of algorithms, while theoretically suboptimal or based on theoretically inconsistent assumptions, perform close to optimally in the MMSE sense.",Robust automatic speech recognition (ASR); speech enhancement; mel-frequency cepstral coefficient (MFCC); minimum mean-square error (MMSE) estimation

This retrospective cohort study included neonates who underwent CH, SHC, and WBC between 2012 and 2020. Mean rectal temperature was maintained at 33.5 ± 0.5°C by cooling the head and the body in the CH group, at 34.5 ± 0.5°C by cooling the head in the SHC group, and at 33.5 ± 0.5°C by cooling the body in the WBC group. The groups were compared in terms of side effects, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scores, and status at discharge. The study included 60 neonates in the CH group, 112 in the WBC group, and 27 in the SHC group. There was no significant difference in side effects between the groups (p > 0.05). There was no significant difference in brain MRI scores between the groups (p > 0.05); however, gray matter, white matter, and total MRI scores in the CH group were lower than in the WBC group. Duration of hospitalization was shorter in the CH group than in the other two groups (p = 0.022). CH was not associated with more side effects than the two classical TH methods. In addition, some of these findings suggest that CH might result in better clinical outcome than the two classical TH methods.",hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy; newborns; selective head cooling; therapeutic hypothermia; whole-body cooling.

Cancer metastasis or recurrence mediated by cellular invasiveness occurs at advanced stages of cancer progression. Cancer Stem Cells (CSCs) enrichment in tumors leads to chemoresistance, which results in cancer mortality. Exposure to environmental pollutants such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons is associated with an increased the risk of CSC enrichment in gynecological cancers. One of the important pathways that mediates the metabolism and bioactivation of these environmental chemicals is the transcription factor, aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR). The present review explores the molecular mechanisms regulating the crosstalk and interaction of the AhR with cancer-related signaling pathways, such as apoptosis, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, immune checkpoints, and G-protein-coupled receptors in several gynecological malignancies such as ovarian, uterine, endometrial, and cervical cancers. The review also discusses the potential of targeting the AhR pathway as a novel chemotherapy for gynecological cancers.",Aryl hydrocarbon receptor; CYP1A1/ CYP1B1; Cancer stem cells; Chemoresistance; Gynecological cancers; Stemness markers.

339,An accelerated correlation filter tracker,"Xu, Tianyang; Feng, Zhen-Hua; Wu, Xiao-Jun; Kittler, Josef","Recent visual object tracking methods have witnessed a continuous improvement in the state-of-the-art with the development of efficient discriminative correlation filters (DCF) and robust deep neural network features. Despite the outstanding performance achieved by the above combination, existing advanced trackers suffer from the burden of high computational complexity of the deep feature extraction and online model learning. We propose an accelerated ADMM optimisation method obtained by adding a momentum to the optimisation sequence iterates, and by relaxing the impact of the error between DCF parameters and their norm. The proposed optimisation method is applied to an innovative formulation of the DCF design, which seeks the most discriminative spatially regularised feature channels. A further speed up is achieved by an adaptive initialisation of the filter optimisation process. The significantly increased convergence of the DCF filter is demonstrated by establishing the optimisation process equivalence with a continuous dynamical system for which the convergence properties can readily be derived. The experimental results obtained on several well-known benchmarking datasets demonstrate the efficiency and robustness of the proposed ACFT method, with a tracking accuracy comparable to the start-of-the-art trackers.

Further, to improve the sensitivity, surface side optimization has been done rather than epi-layer optimization. In this paper, a back-barrier (epi-layer) technique is proposed to improve the sensitivity of the GaN based sensor. To measure the sensitivity, voltage readout is used as it provides better sensitivity than that of a current readout. SILVACO ATLAS Technology Computer Aided Design (TCAD) is used to analyze the performance of the proposed technique. In order to perform a realistic simulation, the TCAD simulation is validated with measured data. The proposed back-barrier technique in the GaN HEMT is shown to improve the sensitivity by 14% as compared to the state of the art. Therefore, the use of the proposed back-barrier technique is considered promising for the GaN HEMT based sensors.",Sensors; Voltage measurement; Sensitivity; HEMTs; Logic gates; Electric potential; Optimization; Voltage readout; GaN HEMT; sensitivity; back barrier technique

While the choice of feature representation is often not central to the logic of a given algorithm, the quality of the feature representation can have critically important implications for performance. Here, we demonstrate a large-scale feature search approach to generating new, more powerful feature representations in which a multitude of complex, nonlinear, multilayer neuromorphic feature representations are randomly generated and screened to find those best suited for the task at hand. In particular, we show that a brute-force search can generate representations that, in combination with standard machine learning blending techniques, achieve state-of-the-art performance on the Labeled Faces in the Wild (LFW) [19] unconstrained face recognition challenge set. These representations outperform previous state-of-the-art approaches, in spite of requiring less training data and using a conceptually simpler machine learning backend.

345,Prolonged Therapy Is Not Associated with Delayed Identification of Recurrent Intra-Abdominal Infection,"Andrew Dulek,Jacob C O'Dell,Christopher A Guidry,Andrew Dulek,Jacob C O'Dell,Christopher A Guidry","Background: The Study to Optimize Peritoneal Infection Therapy (STOP-IT) Trial identified an association between prolonged antibiotic therapy and delayed identification of recurrent intra-abdominal infection (IAI). However, this association has not been observed in other studies. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the association between recurrent IAIs and the duration of antibiotic agents. Patients and Methods: Adult patients from 2016 to 2020 who underwent a source control procedure for a colon-related complicated IAI were identified. Patients not meeting the inclusion criteria were excluded. Demographics, comorbidities, post-operative antibiotic duration, and presence of secondary intra-abdominal infection were recorded. The primary outcome was the time to identification of secondary IAI. Delayed identification of recurrent infection was identified as 10 or more days following source control procedure. Statistical analysis using χ2, Fisher exact, and Wilcoxon rank sum were used where appropriate. Results: Seventy-six of the patients identified met inclusion criteria, and 17 (22.4%) of those patients had a recurrent IAI. Patients with recurrent infections were slightly younger (64 vs. 60 years; p = 0.01) and had lower rates of pre-operative anticoagulation (50.8% vs. 17.6%). There were no differences in the initial length of antibiotic therapy after source control between the recurrent infection and non-recurrent groups (p = 0.6). There was a difference in total days of antibiotic use between the two groups, with the recurrent infection group averaging 10 more days of antibiotic use than the non-recurrence group (p < 0.0001). In those patients with a recurrence, there were no differences in median days to identification (9 vs. 11.5 days; p = 0.29) or the rate of those with delayed identification of recurrent infection (44.4% vs. 75%; p = 0.33). Conclusions: Similar to the STOP-IT Trial we failed to identify an association between the duration of post-operative antibiotic agents and recurrent infection. However, we further failed to identify an association between the prolonged post-operative courses and the timing of identification of the recurrent infection. Further evaluation is needed to determine if prolonged therapy delays the identification of recurrent infection.",antibiotic duration; complicated intra-abdominal infection; recurrence.
346,Hyperdrive: A Multi-Chip Systolically Scalable Binary-Weight CNN Inference Engine,"Andri, Renzo; Cavigelli, Lukas; Rossi, Davide; Benini, Luca","Deep neural networks have achieved impressive results in computer vision and machine learning. Unfortunately, state-of-the-art networks are extremely compute and memory intensive, which makes them unsuitable for mW-devices such as loT end-nodes. Aggressive quantization of these networks dramatically reduces the computation and memory footprint. Binary-weight neural networks (BWNs) follow this trend, pushing weight quantization to the limit. Hardware accelerators for BWNs presented up to now have focused on core efficiency, disregarding I/O bandwidth, and system-level efficiency that are crucial for the deployment of accelerators in ultra-low power devices. We present Hyperdrive: a BWN accelerator dramatically reducing the I/O bandwidth exploiting a novel binary-weight streaming approach, which can he used for an arbitrarily sized convolutional neural network architecture and input resolution by exploiting the natural scalability of the compute units both at chip-level and system-level by arranging Hyperdrive chips systolically in a 2D mesh while processing the entire feature map together in parallel. Hyperdrive achieves 4.3 TOp/s/W system-level efficiency (i.e., including I/Os)-3.1 x higher than state-of-the-art BWN accelerators, even if its core uses resource-intensive FP16 arithmetic for increased robustness.",Hardware accelerator; neural network hardware; binary-weight neural networks; Internet of Things; systolic arrays; application specific integrated circuits
347,Learning to Deblur Images with Exemplars,"Pan, Jinshan; Ren, Wenqi; Hu, Zhe; Yang, Ming-Hsuan","Human faces are one interesting object class with numerous applications. While significant progress has been made in the generic deblurring problem, existing methods are less effective for blurry face images. The success of the state-of-the-art image deblurring algorithms stems mainly from implicit or explicit restoration of salient edges for kernel estimation. However, existing methods are less effective as only few edges can be restored from blurry face images for kernel estimation. In this paper, we address the problem of deblurring face images by exploiting facial structures. We propose a deblurring algorithm based on an exemplar dataset without using coarse-to-fine strategies or heuristic edge selections. In addition, we develop a convolutional neural network to restore sharp edges from blurry images for deblurring. Extensive experiments against the state-of-the-art methods demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm for deblurring face images. In addition, we show that the proposed algorithms can be applied to image deblurring for other object classes.",Image deblurring; face image; exemplar-based; edge prediction; deep edge

Consistency-Preserving Operators for Efficient Product Line Configuration,"Horcas, Jose-Miguel; Struber, Daniel; Burdusel, Alexandru; Martinez, Jabier; Zschaler, Steffen","When configuring a software product line, finding a good trade-off between multiple orthogonal quality concerns is a challenging multi-objective optimisation problem. State-of-the-art solutions based on search-based techniques create invalid configurations in intermediate steps, requiring additional repair actions that reduce the efficiency of the search. In this work, we introduce consistency-preserving configuration operators (CPCOs)-genetic operators that maintain valid configurations throughout the entire search. CPCOs bundle coherent sets of changes: the activation or deactivation of a particular feature together with other (de)activations that are needed to preserve validity. In our evaluation, our instantiation of the IBEA algorithm with CPCOs outperforms two state-of-the-art tools for optimal product line configuration in terms of both speed and solution quality. The improvements are especially pronounced in large product lines with thousands of features.",Maintenance engineering; Standards; Genetics; Encoding; Search problems; Costs; Computational modeling; Software product lines; feature model configuration; search-based software engineering

351,A Generic Interface Enabling Combinations of State-of-the-Art Path Planning and Tracking Algorithms,"Rumetshofer, Johannes; Stolz, Michael; Watzenig, Daniel","In the development of Level 4 automated driving functions, very specific, but diverse, requirements with respect to the operational design domain have to be considered. In order to accelerate this development, it is advantageous to combine dedicated state-of-the-art software components, as building blocks in modular automated driving function architectures, instead of developing special solutions from scratch. However, e.g., in local motion planning and control, the combination of components is still limited in practice, due to necessary interface alignments, which might yield sub-optimal solutions and additional development overhead. The application of generic interfaces, which manage the data transfer between the software components, has the potential to avoid these drawbacks and hence, to further boost this development approach. This publication contributes such a generic interface concept between the local path planning and path tracking systems. The crucial point is a generalization of the lateral tracking error computation, based on an introduced error classification. It substantiates the integration of an internal reference path representation into the interface, to resolve the component interdependencies. The resulting, proposed interface enables arbitrary combinations of components from a comprehensive set of state-of-the-art path planning and tracking algorithms. Two interface implementations are finally applied in an exemplary automated driving function assembly task.",ODD-based AD function design; path tracking; path planning; software architecture; interface design

These datasets usually capture simple daily life actions. Here, we introduce a new dataset, the Martial Arts, Dancing and Sports (MADS), which consists of challenging martial arts actions (Tai-chi and Karate), dancing actions (hip-hop and jazz), and sports actions (basketball, volleyball, football, rugby, tennis and badminton). Two martial art masters, two dancers and an athlete performed these actions while being recorded with either multiple cameras or a stereo depth camera. In the multi-view or single-view setting, we provide three color views for 2D image-based human pose estimation algorithms. For depth-based human pose estimation, we provide stereo-based depth images from a single view. All videos have corresponding synchronized and calibrated ground-truth poses, which were captured using a Motion Capture system. We provide initial baseline results on our dataset using a variety of tracking frameworks, including a generative tracker based on the annealing particle filter and robust likelihood function, a discriminative tracker using twin Gaussian processes [1], and hybrid trackers, such as Personalized Depth Tracker [2]. The results of our evaluation suggest that discriminative approaches perform better than generative approaches when there are enough representative training samples, and that the generative methods are more robust to diversity of poses, but can fail to track when the motion is too quick for the effective search range of the particle filter. The data and the accompanying code will be made available to the research community. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

353,Toward Multicenter Skin Lesion Classification Using Deep Neural Network With Adaptively Weighted Balance Loss,"Yue, Guanghui; Wei, Peishan; Zhou, Tianwei; Jiang, Qiuping; Yan, Weiqing; Wang, Tianfu","Recently, deep neural network-based methods have shown promising advantages in accurately recognizing skin lesions from dermoscopic images. However, most existing works focus more on improving the network framework for better feature representation but ignore the data imbalance issue, limiting their flexibility and accuracy across multiple scenarios in multi-center clinics. Generally, different clinical centers have different data distributions, which presents challenging requirements for the network's flexibility and accuracy. In this paper, we divert the attention from framework improvement to the data imbalance issue and propose a new solution for multi-center skin lesion classification by introducing a novel adaptively weighted balance (AWB) loss to the conventional classification network. Benefiting from AWB, the proposed solution has the following advantages: 1) it is easy to satisfy different practical requirements by only changing the backbone; 2) it is user-friendly with no tuning on hyperparameters; and 3) it adaptively enables small intraclass compactness and pays more attention to the minority class. Extensive experiments demonstrate that, compared with solutions equipped with state-of-the-art loss functions, the proposed solution is more flexible and more competent for tackling the multi-center imbalanced skin lesion classification task with considerable performance on two benchmark datasets. In addition, the proposed solution is proved to be effective in handling the imbalanced gastrointestinal disease classification task and the imbalanced DR grading task.

Still, there are some serious challenges on HGR methods such as sensitivity to rotation, scale, illumination, perturbation, and occlusion. In this paper, we study HGR from graph viewpoints. We introduce a set of meaningful shape features based on a graph constructed by Growing Neural Gas (GNG) algorithm. These features are constructed from topological properties of this graph. Graph properties in conserving topological features improve stability against different deformations, scale, and noise. We evaluate our method on NTU Hand Digits dataset with state-of-the-art methods. We also prepared a comprehensive dataset (SBU-1) for different hand gestures containing 2170 images. This dataset includes many possible deformations and variations and some articulations. Most of the existing datasets don't capture these variations.

The direction of greatest intraspecific phenotypic variance is thought to correspond to an 'evolutionary line of least resistance', i.e. a taxon's phenotype is expected to evolve along that general direction, if not constrained otherwise. In particular, heterochrony, whereby the timing or rate of developmental processes are modified, has often been invoked to describe evolutionary trajectories and it may be advantageous to organisms when rapid adaptation is critical. Yet, to date, little is known empirically as to which covariation patterns, whether static allometry, as measured in adult forms only, or ontogenetic allometry, the basis for heterochrony, may be prevalent in what circumstances. Here, we quantify the morphology of segminiplanate conodont elements during two distinct time intervals separated by more than 130 Myr: the Devonian-Carboniferous boundary and the Carnian-Norian boundary (Late Triassic). We evidence that the corresponding species share similar patterns of intraspecific static allometry. Yet, during both crises, conodont evolution was decoupled from this common evolutionary line of least resistance. Instead, it followed heterochrony-like trajectories that furthermore appear as driven by ocean temperature. This may have implications for our interpretation of conodonts' and past marine ecosystems' response to environmental perturbations.",conodonts; developmental bias; environment; evolution; geometric morphometrics; macroevolution.

In the present study, we evaluated the genetic diversity and genetic structure of four separated localities along the coast of the Yucatan peninsula (Champoton, CH; Isla Arena, IA; Rio Lagartos, RL; and Holbox Island, HI), using nine microsatellite-type molecular markers for this species. The aim of this study is to obtain a baseline of the current level of genetic diversity, which would allow the monitoring of important changes over time. Multilocus analyses revealed moderate levels of genetic diversity (He, 0.5230 to 0.6389) and genetic structure within the whole study area (FST 0.025). The population from RL showed limited gene flows, differing significantly from the other sampling sites.

Nutrition-sensitive agriculture programmes can help address rural undernutrition. However, questions remain on the costs of multisectoral programmes. This study estimates the economic costs of the Targeting and Re-aligning Agriculture to Improve Nutrition (TRAIN) programme, which integrated nutrition behaviour change and agricultural extension with a credit platform to support women's income generation. We used the Strengthening Economic Evaluation for Multisectoral Strategies for Nutrition (SEEMS-Nutrition) approach. The approach aligns costs with a multisectoral nutrition typology, identifying inputs and costs along programme impact pathways. We measure and allocate costs for activities and inputs, combining expenditures and micro-costing. Quantitative and qualitative data were collected retrospectively from implementers and beneficiaries. Expenditure data and economic costs were combined to calculate incremental economic costs. The intervention was designed around a randomised control trial. Incremental costs are presented by treatment arm. The total incremental cost was $795,040.34 for a 3.5-year period. The annual incremental costs per household were US$65.37 (Arm 2), USD$114.15 (Arm 3) and $157.11 (Arm 4). Total costs were led by nutrition counselling (37%), agriculture extension (12%), supervision (12%), training (12%), monitoring and evaluation (9%) and community events (5%). Total input costs were led by personnel (68%), travel (12%) and supplies (7%). This study presents the total incremental costs of an agriculture-nutrition intervention implemented through a microcredit platform. Costs per household compare favourably with similar interventions. Our results illustrate the value of a standardised costing approach for comparison with other multisectoral nutrition interventions.",costs; international child health nutrition; low income countries; maternal public health; nutritional interventions; programme evaluation.
359,Hace1 overexpression mitigates myocardial hypoxia/reoxygenation injury via the effects on Keap1/Nrf2 pathway,"Ting-Yan Chen,Shi-Kang Zheng,Ting-Yan Chen,Shi-Kang Zheng","HECT domain and ankyrin repeat containing E3 ubiquitin protein ligase 1 (Hace1) is a crucial mediator of multiple pathological disorders. However, there are few studies regarding the role of Hace1 in myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury. Here, we studied the functional role of Hace1 on myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury using hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R)-injured cardiac cells in vitro. Reduced levels of Hace1 were observed in H/R-exposed cardiac cells. Hace1-overexpressed cardiac cells were resistant to H/R injuries with reduced apoptosis, lowered oxidative stress, and a suppressed inflammatory response. Subsequent analysis revealed that Hace1 overexpression enhanced the activation of nuclear translocation of nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (Nrf2) and increased the transcriptional activity of Nrf2 in H/R-exposed cardiac cells. The knockout of kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1) diminished the regulatory role of Hace1 on Nrf2 activation. Additionally, inhibiting Nrf2 reversed Hace1-elicited cardioprotective effects in H/R-injured cardiac cells. In short, these data demonstrated that Hace1 overexpression mitigated myocardial H/R injury by enhancing the Nrf2 pathway via Keap1. This work underlines a possible role of Hace1 in myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury and suggests Hace1 as a candidate target for exploiting cardioprotective therapy.",Hace1; Keap1; Myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury; Nrf2; Oxidative stress.

This adder has the ability of switching between the approximate and exact operating modes making it suitable for both error-resilient and exact applications. The structure, which is more area and power efficient than state-of-the-art reconfigurable approximate adders, is achieved by some modifications to the conventional carry look ahead adder (CLA). The efficacy of the proposed RAP-CLA adder is evaluated by comparing its characteristics to those of two state-of-the-art reconfigurable approximate adders as well as the conventional (exact) CLA in a 15 nm FinFET technology. The results reveal that, in the approximate operating mode, the proposed 32-bit adder provides up to 55% and 28% delay and power reductions compared to those of the exact CLA, respectively, at the cost of up to 35.16% error rate. It also provides up to 49% and 19% lower delay and power consumption, respectively, compared to other approximate adders considered in this brief. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed adder on two image processing applications of smoothing and sharpening is demonstrated.",Approximate computing; carry look-ahead adder (CLA); quality of service; reconfigurable

We investigated medication use, including changes in and reasons for changes in use during pregnancy, with attention to medication use in pregnant women with chronic conditions. Materials and Methods: We conducted an online survey of pregnant women aged ≥18 years (n = 1,226). We calculated descriptive statistics for aspects of medication use and performed multivariable logistic regression to examine associations between change in use and chronic conditions. Results: Seventy-nine percent of women took at least one medication during pregnancy. Among those, 63.2% made at least one medication change: 42.0% started, 34.9% stopped, 30.0% missed dose(s), and 18.1% lowered dose(s) from that originally prescribed or recommended. More than a third (36.5%) of women who stopped, lowered, or missed medication did so independent of health care provider advice; 54.0% cited concern about birth or developmental defects as reasons for change.

The resulting feature detector is tightly coupled with the feature descriptor, in contrast to classical approaches (SIFT, etc.), where the detection phase precedes and differs from computing the descriptor. Our approach utilizes two CNN subnetworks, the first being a Siamese CNN and the second, consisting of dual non-weight-sharing CNNs. This allows simultaneous processing and fusion of the joint and disjoint cues in the multimodal image patches. The proposed approach is experimentally shown to outperform contemporary state-of-the-art schemes when applied to multiple datasets of multimodal images. It is also shown to provide repeatable feature points detections across multi-sensor images, outperforming state-of-the-art detectors. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first unified approach for the detection and matching of such images.",Feature extraction; Detectors; Computer architecture; Measurement; Image sensors; Image edge detection; Training; Deep learning; multisensor images; image matching; feature points detection
368,An Adaptive Multiobjective Approach to Evolving ART Architectures,"Kaylani, Assem; Georgiopoulos, Michael; Mollaghasemi, Mansooreh; Anagnostopoulos, Georgios C.; Sentelle, Christopher; Zhong, Mingyu","In this paper, we present the evolution of adaptive resonance theory (ART) neural network architectures (classifiers) using a multiobjective optimization approach. In particular, we propose the use of a multiobjective evolutionary approach to simultaneously evolve the weights and the topology of three well-known ART architectures; fuzzy ARTMAP (FAM), ellipsoidal ARTMAP (EAM), and Gaussian ARTMAP (GAM). We refer to the resulting architectures as MO-GFAM, MO-GEAM, and MO-GGAM, and collectively as MO-GART. The major advantage of MO-GART is that it produces a number of solutions for the classification problem at hand that have different levels of merit [accuracy on unseen data (generalization) and size (number of categories created)]. MO-GART is shown to be more elegant (does not require user intervention to define the network parameters), more effective (of better accuracy and smaller size), and more efficient (faster to produce the solution networks) than other ART neural network architectures that have appeared in the literature. Furthermore, MO-GART is shown to be competitive with other popular classifiers, such as classification and regression tree (CART) and support vector machines (SVMs).",ARTMAP; category proliferation; classification; genetic algorithms (GAs); genetic operators; machine learning
369,Classifying Maqams of Qur'anic Recitations Using Deep Learning,"Shahriar, Sakib; Tariq, Usman","The Holy Qur'an is among the most recited and memorized books in the world. For beautification of Qur'anic recitation, almost all reciters around the globe perform their recitations using a specific melody, known as maqam in Arabic. However, it is more difficult for students to learn this art compared to other techniques of Qur'anic recitation such as Tajwid due to limited resources. Technological advancement can be utilized for automatic classification of these melodies which can then be used by students for self-learning. Using state-of-the-art deep learning algorithms, this research focuses on the classification of the eight popular maqamat (plural of maqam). Various audio features including Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients, spectral, energy and chroma features are obtained for model training. Several deep learning architectures including CNN, LSTM, and deep ANN are trained to classify audio samples from one of the eight maqamat. An accuracy of 95.7% on the test set is obtained using a 5-layer deep ANN which was trained using 26 input features. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first ever work that addresses maqam classification of Holy Qur'an recitations. We also introduce the ""Maqam-478"" dataset that can be used for further improvements on this work.",Audio classification; Qur'anic maqamat; deep learning; CNN; LSTM; supervised learning
370,Working memory is updated by reallocation of resources from obsolete to new items,"Robert Taylor,Ivan Tomić,David Aagten-Murphy,Paul M Bays,Robert Taylor,Ivan Tomić,David Aagten-Murphy,Paul M Bays","Visual working memory (VWM) resources are limited, placing constraints on how much visual information can be simultaneously retained. During visually guided activity, stored information can quickly become outdated, so updating mechanisms are needed to ensure the contents of memory remain relevant to current task goals. In particular, successful deallocation of resources from items that become obsolete is likely to be critical for maintaining the precision of those representations still in memory. The experiments in this study involved presenting two memory arrays of coloured disks in sequence. The appearance of the second array was a cue to replace, rehearse, or add a new colour to the colours in memory. We predicted that successful resource reallocation should result in comparable recall precision when an item was replaced or rehearsed, owing to the removal of pre-replacement features. In contrast, a failure to update WM should lead to comparable precision with a condition in which a new colour was added to memory. We identified a very small proportion (∼5%) of trials in which participants incorrectly reported a feature from the first array in place of its replacement in the second, which we interpreted as a failure to incorporate the information from the second display into memory. Once these trials were discounted, precision estimates were consistent with complete redistribution of resources in the case of updating a single item. We conclude that working memory can be efficiently updated when previous information becomes obsolete, but that this is a demanding active process that occasionally fails.",Intrusion error; Memory updating; Resource reallocation; Short-term memory; Visual working memory.
371,Explicit Modeling of Human-Object Interactions in Realistic Videos,"Prest, Alessandro; Ferrari, Vittorio; Schmid, Cordelia","We introduce an approach for learning human actions as interactions between persons and objects in realistic videos. Previous work typically represents actions with low-level features such as image gradients or optical flow. In contrast, we explicitly localize in space and track over time both the object and the person, and represent an action as the trajectory of the object w.r.t. to the person position. Our approach relies on state-of-the-art techniques for human detection [32], object detection [10], and tracking [39]. We show that this results in human and object tracks of sufficient quality to model and localize human-object interactions in realistic videos. Our human-object interaction features capture the relative trajectory of the object w.r.t. the human. Experimental results on the Coffee and Cigarettes dataset [25], the video dataset of [19], and the Rochester Daily Activities dataset [29] show that 1) our explicit human-object model is an informative cue for action recognition; 2) it is complementary to traditional low-level descriptors such as 3D-HOG [23] extracted over human tracks. We show that combining our human-object interaction features with 3D-HOG improves compared to their individual performance as well as over the state of the art [23], [29].",Action recognition; human-object interaction; video analysis

The R-AFE efficiently reuses a reconfigurable preamplifier, a current generator (CG), and a mixed signal processing unit, having an area of 1.1 mm(2) per R-AFE while supporting five acquisition modes to record different forms of cardiovascular and respiratory signals. The R-AFE can interface with voltage-, current-, impedance-, and light-sensors and hence can measure electrocardiography (ECG), bio-impedance (BioZ), photoplethysmogram (PPG), galvanic skin response (GSR), and general-purpose analog signals. Thanks to the chopper preamplifier and the low-noise CG utilizing dynamic element matching, the R-AFE mitigates 1/f noise from both the preamplifier and the CG for improved measurement sensitivity.

A deeper understanding of the complex TME and cellular heterogeneity is urgently needed in ESCC. Here, we generated single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) of 25 796 immune and 8197 non-immune cells from three primary tumor and paired normal samples in ESCC patients. The results revealed intratumoral and intertumoral epithelium heterogeneity and tremendously differences in tumor and normal epithelium. The infiltration of myofibroblasts, one subtype of fibroblasts, might play important roles in the progression of ESCC. We also found that some differentially expressed genes and markers in epithelium and fibroblast subtypes showed prognostic values for ESCC. Diverse cell subtypes of T cells and myeloid cells were identified, including tumor-enriched HAVCR2+ CD4+ T cells with significantly exhausted signature. The epithelium and myeloid cells had more frequent cell-cell communication compared with epithelium and T cells.

To do so, graphical user interfaces (GUIs) are an important component. Existing Python packages for annotation and analysis of time-series data have been developed without addressing adaptability, usability, and user experience. Therefore, we developed a generic open-source Python package focusing on adaptability, usability, and user experience. The developed package, Machine Learning and Data Analytics (MaD) GUI, enables developers to rapidly create a GUI for their specific use case. Furthermore, MaD GUI enables domain experts without programming knowledge to annotate time-series data and apply algorithms to it. We conducted a small-scale study with participants from three international universities to test the adaptability of MaD GUI by developers and to test the user interface by clinicians as representatives of domain experts. MaD GUI saves up to 75% of time in contrast to using a state-of-the-art package. In line with this, subjective ratings regarding usability and user experience show that MaD GUI is preferred over a state-of-the-art package by developers and clinicians. MaD GUI reduces the effort of developers in creating GUIs for time-series analysis and offers similar usability and user experience for clinicians as a state-of-the-art package.",python; time series analysis; annotation; graphical user interface; gait analysis

The state-of-the-art accuracy is typically achieved by supervised learning methods, where gathering the requisite expert-labeled image annotations in a scalable manner remains a main obstacle. Therefore, annotation-efficient methods that permit to produce accurate anatomical structure segmentation are highly desirable. In this work, we present Contour Transformer Network (CTN), a one-shot anatomy segmentation method with a naturally built-in human-in-the-loop mechanism. We formulate anatomy segmentation as a contour evolution process and model the evolution behavior by graph convolutional networks (GCNs). Training the CTN model requires only one labeled image exemplar and leverages additional unlabeled data through newly introduced loss functions that measure the global shape and appearance consistency of contours. On segmentation tasks of four different anatomies, we demonstrate that our one-shot learning method significantly outperforms non-learning-based methods and performs competitively to the state-of-the-art fully supervised deep learning methods.

377,Robust optical flow estimation via edge preserving filtering,"Rao, Sana; Wang, Hanzi","It is known that optical flow estimation techniques suffer from the issues of ill-defined edges and boundaries of the moving objects. Traditional variational methods for optical flow estimation are not robust to handle these issues since the local filters in these methods do not hold the robustness near the edges. In this paper, we propose a non-local total variation NLTV-L-1 optical flow estimation method based on robust weighted guided filtering. Specifically, first, the robust weighted guided filtering objective function is proposed to preserve motion edges. The proposed objective function is based on the linear model which is computationally efficient and edge-preserving in complex natural scenarios. Second, the proposed weighted guided filtering objective function is incorporated into the non-local total variation NLTV-L-1 energy function. Finally, the novel NLTV-L-1 optical flow method is performed using the coarse-to-fine process. Additionally, we modify some state-of-the-art variational optical flow estimation methods by the robust weighted guided filtering objective function to verify the performance on Middlebury, MPI-Sintel, and Foggy Zurich sequences. Experimental results show that the proposed method can preserve edges and improve the accuracy of optical flow estimation compared with several state-of-the-art methods.",Robust optical flow estimation; Motion estimation; Edge-preserving; Weighted guided filtering; NLTV-L-1 model

The piezoelectric actuation is one of the most important driving methods to perform the motion output with miniature structures.

However, the underlying molecular mechanisms specifically in patients with colon cancer have not yet been explored. Our data showed that Lar significantly suppressed proliferation and migration of colon cancer cells. In addition, Lar suppressed the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process, as evidenced by elevation in E-cadherin (E-cad), and downregulation of vimentin and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) 2/9 expression. Furthermore, Lar was found to activate autophagic flux, in which Lar increased the ratio between LC3II/LC3I and decreased the expression of p62 in colon cancer cells. More importantly, Lar also increased AMPK phosphorylation and suppressed mTOR phosphorylation in colon cancer cells. However, when we silenced AMPK in colon cancer cells, Lar-induced accumulation of autolysomes as well as Lar-induced suppression of the EMT process were significantly diminished. An in vivo assay also confirmed that tumour volume and weight decreased in Lar-treated mice than in control mice. Taken together, this study suggests that Lar significantly suppresses colon cancer proliferation and migration by activating AMPK/mTOR-mediated autophagic cell death.",AMPK/mTOR signalling; Larotrectinib; autophagy flux; colon cancer; epithelial-mesenchymal transition.

C.; Spangler, Elaine; Rebbeck, Timothy; Tomaszewski, John E.; Madabhushi, Anant","In this work, we present a new methodology to facilitate prediction of recurrent prostate cancer (CaP) following radical prostatectomy (RP) via the integration of quantitative image features and protein expression in the excised prostate. Creating a fused predictor from high-dimensional data streams is challenging because the classifier must 1) account for the ""curse of dimensionality"" problem, which hinders classifier performance when the number of features exceeds the number of patient studies and 2) balance potential mismatches in the number of features across different channels to avoid classifier bias towards channels with more features. Our new data integration methodology, supervised Multi-view Canonical Correlation Analysis (sMVCCA), aims to integrate infinite views of highdimensional data to provide more amenable data representations for disease classification. Additionally, we demonstrate sMVCCA using Spearman's rank correlation which, unlike Pearson's correlation, can account for nonlinear correlations and outliers. Forty CaP patients with pathological Gleason scores 6-8 were considered for this study. 21 of these men revealed biochemical recurrence (BCR) following RP, while 19 did not. For each patient, 189 quantitative histomorphometric attributes and 650 protein expression levels were extracted from the primary tumor nodule. The fused histomorphometric/proteomic representation via sMVCCA combined with a random forest classifier predicted BCR with a mean AUC of 0.74 and a maximum AUC of 0.9286. We found sMVCCA to perform statistically significantly (p < 0.05) better than comparative state-of-the-art data fusion strategies for predicting BCR. Furthermore, Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated improved BCR-free survival prediction for the sMVCCA-fused classifier as compared to histology or proteomic features alone.",Data fusion; digital pathology; dimensionality reduction; mass spectrometry; prostate cancer; proteomics

390,Fruit classification based on weighted score-level feature fusion,"Kuang, Hulin; Chan, Leanne Lai Hang; Liu, Cairong; Yan, Hong","We describe an object classification method based on weighted score-level feature fusion using learned weights. Our method is able to recognize 20 object classes in a customized fruit dataset. Although the fusion of multiple features is commonly used to distinguish variable object classes, the optimal combination of features is not well defined. Moreover, in these methods, most parameters used for feature extraction are not optimized and the contribution of each feature to an individual class is not considered when determining the weight of the feature. Our algorithm relies on optimizing a single feature during feature selection and learning the weight of each feature for an individual class from the training data using a linear support vector machine before the features are linearly combined with the weights at the score level.

The objective of this paper is to present the simulation models developed for parallel multipump PVISs fed by a single PV generator. These models seek to maximize the instantaneous water flow rate according to the available PV power and were developed for the typical configurations of large-power irrigation facilities. The models present some advantages when compared with the current state of the art (in which a single motor pump connected to a 1/N fraction of the PV generator is simulated and the result is multiplied by N): in the case of negligible hydraulic friction losses, the use of the multipump model shows gains with respect to the state of the art; in the case of appreciable friction losses, the current state of the art overestimates the productivity of the systems. Then, the ability of these models to compare different multipump designs is shown: two groups of pumps working at variable frequencies show better performance than a group working at a variable frequency and a group at a nominal frequency-an 8% increase in the water pumped is seen.",photovoltaic; PV irrigation systems; multipumping; variable frequency; water pumping

The molecular appearance and operation of native TRPC channels, however, remained poorly understood. Here, we used high-resolution proteomics to show that TRPC channels in the rodent brain are macro-molecular complexes of more than 1 MDa in size that result from the co-assembly of the tetrameric channel core with an ensemble of interacting proteins (interactome). The core(s) of TRPC1-, C4-, and C5-containing channels are mostly heteromers with defined stoichiometries for each subtype, whereas TRPC3, C6, and C7 preferentially form homomers. In addition, TRPC1/C4/C5 channels may co-assemble with the metabotropic glutamate receptor mGluR1, thus guaranteeing both specificity and reliability of channel activation via the phospholipase-Ca2+ pathway. Our results unveil the subunit composition of native TRPC channels and resolve the molecular details underlying their activation.",Ca(2+) signaling; G-protein-coupled receptors; TRP; TRPC C; mass spectrometry; neurons; patch clamp; protein biochemistry; proteomics; transient receptor potential channels.

We build up our interpolation model by using some similar image patches selected according to the nonlocal geometric similarity. First, we use a two-stage search scheme to collect the matched patches inside the whole image. Second, a similarity scaling factor is used in the second search to refine the collected patches so as to help find a robust solution to the MMSE-directed interpolation. Third, our MMSE-directed interpolation is regularized by the involved reference patches to make the solved interpolation coefficients more reliable. Experimental results show that our proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art MMSE-directed linear interpolation schemes andworks competitively with the state-of-the-art learningbased ones.",Image interpolation; minimum mean square error (MMSE); nonlocal geometric similarity

BM is characterised by a complex structure comprising collagenous and non-collagenous proteoglycans and glycoproteins. In the breast, the thickness, density and composition of the BM around the ductal lobular system vary during differing development stages. In pathological conditions, the BM provides a physical barrier that separates proliferating intraductal epithelial cells from the surrounding stroma, and its absence or breach in malignant lesions is a hallmark of invasion and metastases. Currently, diagnostic services often use special stains and immunohistochemistry (IHC) to identify the BM in order to distinguish in situ from invasive lesions. However, distinguishing BM on stained sections, and differentiating the native BM from the reactive capsule or BM-like material surrounding some invasive malignant breast tumours is challenging. Although diagnostic use of the BM is being replaced by myoepithelial cell IHC markers, BM is considered by many to be a useful marker to distinguish in situ from invasive lesions in ambiguous cases. In this review, the structure, function and biological and clinical significance of the BM are discussed in relation to the various breast lesions with emphasis on how to distinguish the native BM from alternative pathological tissue mimicking its histology.",BREAST; Breast Neoplasms; CARCINOMA; COLLAGEN.

The results show the following: (1) The carbon emission intensity of each province in China shows a noticeable spatial spillover effect and a positive spatial correlation distribution of ""high-high"" and ""low-low"" agglomeration. (2) The development of green finance in China is interrelated but uneven in space, which presents a gradient strengthening trend from the west to the east. (3) Green finance development will curb the intensity of carbon emissions, and this effect has gradually been increasing over time and differs by region. Specifically, green finance will increase the carbon emission intensity of adjacent areas in the short term but will significantly reduce the local province's carbon emission intensity to a larger extent. Finally, it puts forward policy recommendations to promote the coordinated development of green finance and a low-carbon economy.",Carbon emission intensity; Green finance; Spatial spillover effect.

Mining data streams is more challenging than mining static data because of the nature of data streams, including high arrival rate, massive volume of incoming data, and concept drift. The existing algorithms for mining frequent closed itemsets over data streams suffer from scalability and efficiency bottlenecks. This paper proposes a novel algorithm for mining frequent closed itemsets over data streams both for the sliding window model and for the landmark model. An indexed prefix closed itemset tree is proposed for compressing all closed itemsets and for quick searching of closed itemsets, and novel search strategies are proposed to prune the search space in updating the set of closed itemsets. The proposed algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art intersection-based algorithms, CICLAD, ConPatSet, and CloStream, by several times to 2 orders of magnitude in efficiency, and also outperforms the state-of-the-art pattern enumeration algorithm, Moment, by up to 2 orders of magnitude over data streams with large windows and sparse data streams.

403,An efficient approach for sub-image separation from large-scale multi-panel images using dynamic programming,"Ali, Mushtaq; Asghar, Muhammad Zubair; Baloch, Amanullah","Multi-panel images are increasingly used in research and medical domains for describing complicated situations like results' comparison in paper; or case depiction of a patient by combining all his medical images into a consolidated image. However, the content based image retrieval (CBIR) systems face the issue of performance decline in terms of poor retrieval accuracy because the individual sub-images of the multi-panel images cannot be accessed during the searching process. Representing multi-panel images in the form of sub-images is a necessary step for improving the retrieval accuracy of CBIR systems. The state-of-the-art multi-panel image segmentation approaches use recursive approach for sub-image separation, which detects the location of the sub-lines of a line in the multi-panel image appearing in its sub-images repeatedly. This characteristic of the available approaches makes the CBIR incapable to provide the intended results to the end users in real time. In this work, a line detection-based method using dynamic programming is proposed for sub-image separation, which detects the position of every line in the multi-panel image only once, instead of several times as in the case of state-of-art approaches. We evaluated the proposed method on a subset of the imageCLEFmed 2013 dataset, containing 1050 images belonging to different groups. The experimental results depict the effectiveness of the proposed method in term of generating the results quickly without losing the accuracy as compare to the state-of-the-art approaches.",Dynamic programming; Multi-panel image; Image segmentation; Image classification; Figure mining; Image retrieval system

Very little is known about the reasons why gas diffusion electrodes suffer from unstable long-term operation. Often, this is associated with flooding of the gas diffusion electrode (GDE) within a few hours of operation. A better understanding of parameters influencing the phase behavior at the electrolyte/electrode/gas interface is necessary to increase the durability of GDEs. In this work, a microfluidic structure with multi-scale porosity featuring heterogeneous surface wettability to realistically represent the behavior of conventional GDEs is presented. A gas/liquid/solid phase boundary was established within a conductive, highly porous structure comprising a silver catalyst and Nafion binder. Inoperando visualization of wetting phenomena was performed using confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM). Non-reversible wetting, wetting of hierarchically porous structures and electrowetting were observed and analyzed. Fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) enabled the observation of reactions on the model electrode surface.

The BS in the decentralized algorithm consists of multiple processing units (PUs), and each PU separately estimates the channels of a group of users, by employing the proposed D-VBL algorithm. To reduce channel estimation error, the PUs exploit the structured sparsity inherent in multi-user mMIMO channels by exchanging information among themselves. We investigate the proposed C-VBL and low-complexity D-VBL algorithms and show that i) they substantially outperform the state-of-the-art centralized and decentralized algorithms in terms of the normalized mean squared error and the bit error rate. This is because they beneficially exploit the channel sparsity, while the existing state-of-the-art solutions fail to do so. The proposed D-VBL is also robust to PU failures, and provides a similar performance as its centralized counterpart (C-VBL), but with a much reduced complexity.",Channel estimation; Clustering algorithms; Computer architecture; Signal processing algorithms; Bayes methods; Antennas; Downlink; Decentralized architecture; frequency division duplex; variational Bayesian learning

Training robust and accurate diagnostic systems is challenging because only small databases of abnormal-condition data are available. However, the performance of the diagnostic systems depends on the quantity and quality of the data. The training database can be augmented utilizing data augmentation techniques that generate synthetic data to improve diagnostic performance. However, existing data augmentation techniques are generic methods that do not include additional information in the synthetic data. In this paper, we develop a model-based data augmentation technique integrating computer-implementable electromechanical models. Synthetic normal- and abnormal-condition data are generated with an electromechanical model and a stochastic parameter value sampling method. The model-based data augmentation is showcased to detect an abnormal condition of a distribution transformer. First, the synthetic data are compared with the measurements to verify the synthetic data. Then, ML-based diagnostic systems are created using model-based data augmentation and are compared with state-of-the-art diagnostic systems. It is shown that using the model-based data augmentation results in an improved accuracy compared to state-of-the-art diagnostic systems.

Genetic deletion of a chromatin-binding protein, retinoic acid induced 1 (RAI1), causes Smith-Magenis syndrome (SMS). SMS is a syndromic ASD associated with intellectual disability, autistic features, maladaptive behaviors, overt seizures, and abnormal electroencephalogram (EEG) patterns. The molecular and neural mechanisms underlying abnormal brain activity in SMS remain unclear. Here we show that panneural Rai1 deletions in mice result in increased seizure susceptibility and prolonged hippocampal seizure duration in vivo and increased dentate gyrus population spikes ex vivo. Brain-wide mapping of neuronal activity pinpointed selective cell types within the limbic system, including the hippocampal dentate gyrus granule cells (dGCs) that are hyperactivated by chemoconvulsant administration or sensory experience in Rai1-deficient brains. Deletion of Rai1 from glutamatergic neurons, but not from gamma-aminobutyric acidergic (GABAergic) neurons, was responsible for increased seizure susceptibility. Deleting Rai1 from the Emx1Cre-lineage glutamatergic neurons resulted in abnormal dGC properties, including increased excitatory synaptic transmission and increased intrinsic excitability. Our work uncovers the mechanism of neuronal hyperexcitability in SMS by identifying Rai1 as a negative regulator of dGC intrinsic and synaptic excitability.",Smith–Magenis syndrome; autism spectrum disorders; dentate gyrus; neuronal excitability; whole-brain clearing and imaging.

This challenging situation for neural amplifiers occurs, among other applications, in neural recordings of weakly electric fish or nerve activity recordings made with cuff electrodes. This paper reports an integrated neural amplifier architecture targeting in-vivo recording of local field potentials and unitary signals from the brain stem of a weakly electric fish Gymnotus omarorum. The proposed architecture offers low noise, high common-mode rejection ratio (CMRR), current-efficiency, and a high-pass frequency fixed without MOS pseudoresistors. The main contributions of this work are the overall architecture coupled with an efficient and simple single-stage circuit for the amplifier main transconductor, and the ability of the amplifier to acquire biopotential signals from high-amplitude common-mode interference in an unshielded environment. A fully-integrated neural preamplifier, which performs well in line with the state-of-the-art of the field while providing enhanced CMRR performance, was fabricated in a 0.5 mu m CMOS process. Results from measurements show that the gain is 49.5 dB, the bandwidth ranges from 13 Hz to 9.8 kHz, the equivalent input noise is 1.88 mu V-rms, the CMRR is 87 dB and the Noise Efficiency Factor is 2.1.

Variation in allied health care may affect patient outcomes. We aimed to explore adherence in providing early allied health assessments in accordance with local parameters. Associations between the number of assessments and hospital length of stay (LOS) were also explored. The Burns Registry of Australia and New Zealand was queried for adult (≥ 16 years) burn injured patients admitted to a specialist burn service for > 48 hours between July 2016 and June 2020. Quality indicator data relating to allied health assessment processes were examined; patients were grouped according to the number of assessments they received within 48 hours of admission. Of the 5789 patients included in the study, 5598 (97%) received at least one allied health assessment within 48 hours of admission and 3976 (69%) received all three assessments. A greater proportion of patients who received no assessments were admitted on a Saturday. Patients receiving three assessments had more severe injuries compared to their counterparts who received fewer assessments. Hospital LOS was not associated with the number of allied health assessments during an acute admission following burn injury after accounting for confounding factors, particularly TBSA. Multidisciplinary allied health teams provide routine burn care to Australian and New Zealand burns patients at a consistent level. Further, this study provides evidence that allied health input is prioritised towards patients with increasing severity of burn injury, playing an integral role in early rehabilitation.",Australia; New Zealand; allied health; burn.

Venkatesh; Parate, Priti; Acharya, Aniruddha K.","Visual tracking is an important task in various computer vision applications including visual surveillance, human computer interaction, event detection, video indexing and retrieval. Recent state of the art sparse representation (SR) based trackers show better robustness than many of the other existing trackers. One of the issues with these SR trackers is low execution speed. The particle filter framework is one of the major aspects responsible for slow execution, and is common to most of the existing SR trackers. In this paper,(1) we propose a robust interest point based tracker in l(1) minimization framework that runs at real-time with performance comparable to the state of the art trackers. In the proposed tracker, the target dictionary is obtained from the patches around target interest points. Next, the interest points from the candidate window of the current frame are obtained. The correspondence between target and candidate points is obtained via solving the proposed l(1) minimization problem. In order to prune the noisy matches, a robust matching criterion is proposed, where only the reliable candidate points that mutually match with target and candidate dictionary elements are considered for tracking. The object is localized by measuring the displacement of these interest points. The reliable candidate patches are used for updating the target dictionary. The performance and accuracy of the proposed tracker is benchmarked with several complex video sequences. The tracker is found to be considerably fast as compared to the reported state of the art trackers. The proposed tracker is further evaluated for various local patch sizes, number of interest points and regularization parameters. The performance of the tracker for various challenges including illumination change, occlusion, and background clutter has been quantified with a benchmark dataset containing 50 videos.

The other two color values of each pixel must be interpolated from the neighboring pixels in the so-called demosaicking process. State-of-the-art demosaicking algorithms take advantage of interchannel correlation locally selecting the best interpolation direction. These methods give impressive results except when local geometry cannot be inferred from neighboring pixels or channel correlation is low. In these cases, they create interpolation artifacts. We introduce a new algorithm involving nonlocal image self-similarity in order to reduce interpolation artifacts when local geometry is ambiguous. The proposed algorithm introduces a clear and intuitive manner of balancing how much channel-correlation must be taken advantage of.

In addition, 2'-FL increased the abundance of Blautia and Olsenella and improved the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 levels. The abundance of Blautia and Olsenella positively correlated with the IL-10 levels. 2'-FL also decreased the abundance of Enterorhabdus and Lachnospiraceae_UCG-006 and elevated SCFA levels, showing a negative correlation between these genera and SCFAs.

Children affected by CALFB may have undergone multiple abuses - such as ritual starvation, beatings, burns, stabbings and drowning - prompting concern in hospitals, schools and communities, including in emergency and primary care settings. Nurses have an important role in safeguarding children and young people, and their role in identifying and responding to CALFB is often challenging. This article uses a 'competemility' (cultural competence and cultural humility) approach to raise awareness of CALFB reporting and investigations in the UK. It examines medical evidence and psychosocial indicators of this form of abuse and explains the metaphorical language and thoughts associated with reported beliefs. The article aims to support nurses to be culturally sensitive to CALFB and to explore how they can contribute to preserve the safety of children in familial and community settings.",child abuse; clinical; cultural competence; culture; diversity; health promotion; professional; professional issues; religion; safeguarding; spirituality; transcultural care.
418,Contrastive and Selective Hidden Embeddings for Medical Image Segmentation,"Liu, Zihao; Li, Zhuowei; Hu, Zhiqiang; Xia, Qing; Xiong, Ruiqin; Zhang, Shaoting; Jiang, Tingting","Medical image segmentation is fundamental and essential for the analysis of medical images. Although prevalent success has been achieved by convolutional neural networks (CNN), challenges are encountered in the domain of medical image analysis by two aspects: 1) lack of discriminative features to handle similar textures of distinct structures and 2) lack of selective features for potential blurred boundaries in medical images. In this paper, we extend the concept of contrastive learning (CL) to the segmentation task to learn more discriminative representation. Specifically, we propose a novel patch-dragsaw contrastive regularization (PDCR) to perform patch-level tugging and repulsing. In addition, a new structure, namely uncertainty-aware feature re- weighting block (UAFR), is designed to address the potential high uncertainty regions in the feature maps and serves as a better feature re- weighting. Our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art results across 8 public datasets from 6 domains. Besides, the method also demonstrates robustness in the limited-data scenario.

419,Haze Removal Using Radial Basis Function Networks for Visibility Restoration Applications,"Chen, Bo-Hao; Huang, Shih-Chia; Li, Chian-Ying; Kuo, Sy-Yen","Restoration of visibility in hazy images is the first relevant step of information analysis in many outdoor computer vision applications. To this aim, the restored image must feature clear visibility with sufficient brightness and visible edges, while avoiding the production of noticeable artifacts. In this paper, we propose a haze removal approach based on the radial basis function (RBF) through artificial neural networks dedicated to effectively removing haze formation while retaining not only the visible edges but also the brightness of restored images. Unlike traditional haze-removal methods that consist of single atmospheric veils, the multiatmospheric veil is generated and then dynamically learned by the neurons of the proposed RBF networks according to the scene complexity. Through this process, more visible edges are retained in the restored images. Subsequently, the activation function during the testing process is employed to represent the brightness of the restored image. We compare the proposed method with the other state-of-the-art haze-removal methods and report experimental results in terms of qualitative and quantitative evaluations for benchmark color images captured in typical hazy weather conditions. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method is able to produce brighter and more vivid haze-free images with more visible edges than can the other state-of-the-art methods.",Dehazing; haze removal; visibility restoration

Fortunately, the emergence of edge computing has provided a promising way to reduce the video load on the network by caching contents closer to users.But caching replacement algorithm is essential for the cache efficiency considering the limited cache space under existing edge-assisted network architecture. To investigate the challenges and opportunities inside, we first measure the performance of five state-of-the-art caching algorithms based on three real-world datasets. Our observation shows that state-of-the-art caching replacement algorithms suffer from following weaknesses: 1) the rule-based replacement approachs (e.g., LFU,LRU) cannot adapt under different scenarios; 2) data-driven forecast approaches only work efficiently on specific scenarios or datasets, as the extracted features working on one dataset may not work on another one. Motivated by these observations and edge-assisted computation capacity, we then propose an edge-assisted intelligent caching replacement framework <italic>LSTM-C</italic> based on deep Long Short-Term Memory network, which contains two types of modules: 1) four basic modules manage the coordination among content requests, content replace, cache space, service management; 2) three learning-based modules enable the online deep learning to provide intelligent caching strategy. Supported by this design, LSTM-C learns the pattern of content popularity at long and short time scales as well as determines the cache replacement policy. Most important, LSTM-C represents the request pattern with built-in memory cells, thus requires no data pre-processing, pre-programmed model or additional information. Our experiment results show that LSTM-C outperforms state-of-the-art methods in cache hit rate on three real-traces of video requests. When the cache size is limited, LSTM-C outperforms baselines by on average respectively, which are fast enough for online operations.",Edge-assisted caching replacement; intelligent content caching; long short term memory

Due to increasing abundance of diverse video content in the era of big data, research on human action recognition has recently shifted towards more challenging and realistic settings. Frame rate is one of key issues in diverse and realistic video settings. While there have been several evaluation studies investigating different aspects of action recognition such as different visual descriptors, the frame rate issue has been seldom addressed in the literature. Therefore, in this paper, we investigate the impact of frame rate on human action recognition with several state-of-the-art approaches and three benchmark data sets. Our experimental results indicate that those state-of-the-art approaches are not robust to the variations of frame rate. As a result, more robust visual features and advanced learning algorithms are required to further improve human action recognition performance towards its more practical deployments. In addition, we investigate key frame selection techniques for choosing a set of suitable frames from an action sequence for action recognition. Promising results indicate that well designed key-frame selection methods can produce a set of representative frames and eventually reduce the impact of frame rate on the performance of human action recognition.

422,Madhubani Art Classification using transfer learning with deep feature fusion and decision fusion based,"Varshney, Seema; Lakshmi, C. Vasantha; Patvardhan, C.","Some traditional Indian art forms enjoy widespread popularity across the world. One of the most prominent among these is the Madhubani style. This art form's rich heritage and beauty enthrall the connoisseurs and continue to inspire new designs catering to the changing tastes of prevalent fashion. Preservation of these traditional art forms is the need of the hour. Modern technological advances can be utilized with great advantage for this purpose. Since a database of Madhubani art forms was hitherto unavailable, an attempt is made in this work to create one from scratch. Five different classes of Madhubani art, i.e., Bharni, Godna, Kachni, Kohbar, and Tantrik, are identified, and the collected images are annotated with these classes. Classification of the art images is attempted using the handcrafted Local Binary Pattern (LBP) texture descriptors and state-of-the-art Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The Transfer Learning approach with CNNs is employed to classify the designs. An attempt is made to obtain a better classification accuracy than the one provided by standard CNNs. Towards this end, the current work proposes a fusion of features extracted from several deep CNNs, decision fusion-based classification based on averaging prediction score (FAVG), and maximum vote score (FMAX). The proposed method's performance is tested on our Madhubani art dataset and compared against several standard pre-trained CNNs available in the literature. The proposed approaches provide significantly higher classification accuracy for Madhubani art patterns, with decision fusion based on averaging prediction score (FAVG) approach being the best. The maximum accuracy, specificity, and error rate scores are 98.82%, 99.72%, and 1.18%, respectively. This is the first such attempt, and the excellent results motivate further work to develop content-based image retrieval tools and evolutionary design-based tools for automating the development of new designs. These endeavors are expected to go a long way in preserving precious art heritage and fostering its rapid growth in the world market. The dataset will be made publically available for further experimentation.",Deep learning; Transfer learning; Convolutional Neural Network; Machine learning; Feature concatenation; Decision fusion

This problem has been established as a very active research field in computer vision during the last few decades. IR has been applied to a high number of real-world problems ranging from remote sensing to medical imaging, artificial vision, and computer-aided design. Recently, there is an increasing interest on the application of the evolutionary computation paradigm to this field in order to solve the ever recurrent drawbacks of traditional image registration methods as the iterated closest point algorithm. Specially, evolutionary image registration methods have demonstrated their ability as robust approaches to the problem. Unlike classical IR methods, they show the advantage of not requiring a good initial estimation of the image alignment to proceed. In this contribution, we aim to review the state-of-the-art image registration methods that lay their foundations on evolutionary computation.

427,Towards Accurate and Lightweight Masked Face Recognition: An Experimental Evaluation,"Martinez-Diaz, Yoanna; Mendez-Vazquez, Heydi; Luevano, Luis S.; Nicolas-Diaz, Miguel; Chang, Leonardo; Gonzalez-Mendoza, Miguel","Given the current COVID-19 pandemic, most people wear a mask to effectively prevent the spread of the contagious disease. This sanitary measure has caused a significant drop in the effectiveness of current face recognition methods when handling masked faces on practical applications such as face access control, face attendance, and face authentication-based mobile payment. Under this situation, recent efforts have been focused on boosting the performance of the existing face recognition technology on masked faces. Some solutions trying to tackle this issue fine-tune the existing deep learning face recognition models on synthetic masked images, while others use the periocular region as a naive manner to eliminate the adverse effect of COVID-19 masks. Although the accuracy of masked face recognition remains an important issue, in the last few years, the development of efficient and lightweight face recognition methods has received an increased attention in the research community. In this paper, we study the effectiveness of three state-of-the-art lightweight face recognition models for addressing accurate and efficient masked face recognition, considering both fine-tuning on masked faces and periocular images. For the experimental evaluation, we create both real and simulated masked face databases as well as periocular datasets. Extensive experiments are conducted to determine the most effective solution and state further steps for the research community. The obtained results disclose that fine-tuning existing state-of-the-art face models on masked images achieve better performance than using periocular-based models. Besides, we evaluate and analyze the effectiveness of the trained masked-based models on well-established unmasked benchmarks for face recognition and assess the efficiency of the used lightweight architectures in comparison with state-of-the-art face models.",Face recognition; Computational modeling; COVID-19; Databases; Pandemics; Analytical models; Benchmark testing; COVID-19 pandemic; lightweight deep models; masked face recognition; periocular recognition
428,Entity Disambiguation Leveraging Multi-Perspective Attention,"Wang, Chengzhi; Sun, Xian; Yu, Hongfeng; Zhang, Wenkai","Entity disambiguation aims to map mentions in text to the corresponding entities in a knowledge base, which is a basic task in natural language processing (NLP). The major challenge in entity disambiguation is how to extract key imformation in mention context and entity description that is discriminative for disambiguation. State-of-the-art entity disambiguation systems apply attention mechanism to identify the imformative components, but most of the methods only focus on mention context, and neglect entity side. Besides, attention mechanism is employed in a single aspect, which may not be effective in difficult circumstances. In this work, we propose a neural network with multi-perspective attention to enrich the representation of mentions and entities in different perspectives. Specifically, we utilize intra-attention to aggregate internal pivotal information in mention context and entity description separately, and utilize inter-attention to interact their latent semantics in multiple directions and highlight the interrelated information, so as to capture more informative features and improve the disambiguation performance. The experimental results show that our proposed model outperforms other state-of-the-art entity disambiguation models and attain more improvements on hard datasets, which validates the effectiveness and superiority of our model, especially in complex situations.",Entity disambiguation; neural network; attention mechanism; multi-perspective attention

430,A Bayesian Based Deep Unrolling Algorithm for Single-Photon Lidar Systems,"Koo, Jakeoung; Halimi, Abderrahim; McLaughlin, Stephen","Deploying 3D single-photon Lidar imaging in real world applications presents multiple challenges including imaging in high noise environments. Several algorithms have been proposed to address these issues based on statistical or learning-based frameworks. Statistical methods provide rich information about the inferred parameters but are limited by the assumed model correlation structures, while deep learning methods show state-of-the-art performance but limited inference guarantees, preventing their extended use in critical applications. This paper unrolls a statistical Bayesian algorithm into a new deep learning architecture for robust image reconstruction from single-photon Lidar data, i.e. the algorithm's iterative steps are converted into neural network layers. The resulting algorithm benefits from the advantages of both statistical and learning based frameworks, providing best estimates with improved network interpretability. Compared to existing learning-based solutions, the proposed architecture requires a reduced number of trainable parameters, is more robust to noise and mismodelling of the system impulse response function, and provides richer information about the estimates including uncertainty measures.

Such variations lead to the failure of the traditional intensity-based registration method. To address this problem, we propose a correlation-weighted sparse representation framework to separate the contrast agent from original liver DCE-MR images. This framework allows the robust registration of motion components over time without intensity variances. Existing sparse coding techniques recover a 3D image containing only contrast agents (named contrast enhancement component) from a manually labeled dictionary, whose column has the same size with the original 3D volume (3D-t mode). The high dimension of the recovery target (3D volume) and the indistinguishability between the unenhanced and enhanced images make accurate coding difficult. In this paper, we predefine an ideal time-intensity curve containing only contrast agents (named contrast agent curve) and recover it from the transpose dictionary (t-3D mode), whose column has been updated into the original time-intensity curves. The low dimension of the target (1D curve) and the significant intergroup difference between contrast agent curves and non-contrast agent curves can estimate a series of pure contrast agent curves. A ""correlation-weighted""constraint is introduced for the selection of a coding subset with more contrast agent curves, leading to an efficient and accurate sparse recovery process. Then, the contrast enhancement component can be estimated by the solved sparse coefficients' map and the ideal curve and subtracted from the original DCE-MRI. Finally, we register the de-enhanced images and apply the obtained deformation fields for the original DCE-MRI to achieve the goal of motion correction. We conduct the experiments on both simulated and real liver DCE-MRI data. Compared with other state-of-the-art DCE-MRI registration methods, the experimental results show that our method achieves a better registration performance with less computational efficiency.",Liver; Lesions; Strain; Dictionaries; Encoding; Image coding; Principal component analysis; DCE-MRI; registration; sparse representation
432,On maximization of the modularity index in network psychometrics,"Michael J Brusco,Douglas Steinley,Ashley L Watts,Michael J Brusco,Douglas Steinley,Ashley L Watts","The modularity index (Q) is an important criterion for many community detection heuristics used in network psychometrics and its subareas (e.g., exploratory graph analysis). Some heuristics seek to directly maximize Q, whereas others, such as the walktrap algorithm, only use the modularity index post hoc to determine the number of communities. Researchers in network psychometrics have typically not employed methods that are guaranteed to find a partition that maximizes Q, perhaps because of the complexity of the underlying mathematical programming problem. In this paper, for networks of the size commonly encountered in network psychometrics, we explore the utility of finding the partition that maximizes Q via formulation and solution of a clique partitioning problem (CPP). A key benefit of the CPP is that the number of communities is naturally determined by its solution and, therefore, need not be prespecified in advance. The results of two simulation studies comparing maximization of Q to two other methods that seek to maximize modularity (fast greedy and Louvain), as well as one popular method that does not (walktrap algorithm), provide interesting insights as to the relative performances of the methods with respect to identification of the correct number of communities and the recovery of underlying community structure.",Clique partitioning; Modularity index; Network psychometrics; Walktrap algorithm.

Subsequent therapeutic options assume the dominant form of the resistance mechanism; however, the more rare oncogenic driver, NTRK1 fusion, has also reportedly conferred osimertinib resistance. Nevertheless, clear-cut options when NSCLCs are driven by EGFR mutation and the subsequent NTRK fusion are lacking. This is a case of NSCLC wherein exon 19 deletion in EGFR (19del) and acquired LMNA-NTRK1 fusion were accompanied by the persistence of EGFR T790M. The patient underwent peritoneal metastasis after multiple targeted therapies: gefitinib, osimertinib, chemotherapy, and anlotinib plus docetaxel (in clinical trials). Osimertinib was subsequently re-administered with the NTRK fusion inhibitor entrectinib, resulting in remission of peritoneal metastases even after slow progression of pancreatic metastasis over the following 5 months. An extensive literature review to identify the efficacies of therapies for NTRK fusion as the means to acquired resistance to EGFR TKIs revealed that blocking both the EGFR mutation and the subsequent NTRK fusion can provide clinical benefits following EGFR TKIs resistance; however, the efficacy and safety of combination therapies must be further investigated.

436,On Load Balancing via Switch Migration in Software-Defined Networking,"Al-Tam, F.; Correia, N.","Switch-controller assignment is an essential task in multi-controller software-defined networking. Static assignments are not practical because network dynamics are complex and difficult to predetermine. Since network load varies both in space and time, the mapping of switches to controllers should be adaptive to sudden changes in the network. To that end, switch migration plays an important role in maintaining dynamic switch-controller mapping. Migrating switches from overloaded to underloaded controllers brings flexibility and adaptability to the network but, at the same time, deciding which switches should be migrated to which controllers, while maintaining a balanced load in the network, is a challenging task. This work presents a heuristic approach with solution shaking to solve the switch migration problem. Shift and swap moves are incorporated within a search scheme. Every move is evaluated by how much benefit it will give to both the immigration and outmigration controllers. The experimental results show that the proposed approach is able to outweigh the state-of-art approaches, and improve the load balancing results up to approximate to 14% in some scenarios when compared to the most recent approach. In addition, the results show that the proposed work is more robust to controller failure than the state-of-art methods.",Load balancing; software-defined networking; switch migration; heuristic

A non-gene drive self-limiting male-bias Ag(PMB)1 strain has been developed in a 47-year-old laboratory G3 strain of Anopheles gambiae s.l. When Ag(PMB)1 males are crossed to wild-type females, expression of the endonuclease I-PpoI during spermatogenesis causes the meiotic cleavage of the X chromosome in sperm cells, leading to fertile offspring with a 95% male bias. However, World Health Organization states that the functionality of the transgene could differ when inserted in different genetic backgrounds of Anopheles coluzzii which is currently a predominant species in several West-African countries and thus a likely recipient for a potential release of self-limiting GMMs. In this study, we introgressed the transgene from the donor Ag(PMB)1 by six serial backcrosses into two recipient colonies of An. coluzzii that had been isolated in Mali and Burkina Faso. Scans of informative Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) markers and whole-genome sequencing analysis revealed a nearly complete introgression of chromosomes 3 and X, but a remarkable genomic divergence in a large region of chromosome 2 between the later backcrossed (BC6) transgenic offspring and the recipient paternal strains. These findings suggested to extend the backcrossing breeding strategy beyond BC6 generation and increasing the introgression efficiency of critical regions that have ecological and epidemiological implications through the targeted selection of specific markers. Disregarding differential introgression efficiency, we concluded that the phenotype of the sex ratio distorter is stable in the BC6 introgressed An. coluzzii strains.",anopheles; genomic divergence; introgression; malaria vector; sex-ratio distorter.

However, the convolution process is typically performed by using a fixed sized kernel, which adversely affects the detection accuracy especially when the acoustic features of different event classes are characterized by high variations. To deal with this, this article proposes a sound event detection technique using a convolutional recurrent neural network framework with multiple convolutional kernels of different sizes. The top performing kernels are selected from a kernel pool based on the unsupervised clustering errors and the accuracies of the temporarily trained models. Afterwards, the selected kernels are fed to multiple convolution layers to deal with the acoustic feature variations. Experimental results on different subsets of AudioSet, namely the DCASE Challenge 2017 Task 4 and DCASE Challenge 2018 Task 4, demonstrate the performance of the proposed approach compared to state-of-the-art systems.",Kernel; Convolution; Acoustics; Event detection; Neural networks; Feature extraction; Training; Sound event detection; kernel optimization; clustering errors; multiple convolution layers
440,Pruning strategies for mining high utility itemsets,"Krishnamoorthy, Srikumar","High utility itemset mining problem involves the use of internal and external utilities of items (such as profits, margins) to discover interesting patterns from a given transactional database. It is an extension of the basic frequent itemset mining problem and is proven to be considerably hard and intractable. This is due to the lack of inherent structural properties of high utility itemsets that can be exploited. Several heuristic methods have been suggested in the literature to limit the large search space. This paper aims to improve the state-of-the-art and proposes a high utility mining method that employs novel pruning strategies. The utility of the proposed method is demonstrated through rigorous experimentation on several real and synthetic benchmark sparse and dense datasets. A comparative evaluation of the method against a state-of-the-art method is also presented. Our experimental results reveal that the proposed method is very effective in pruning unpromising candidates, especially for sparse transactional databases. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

441,A Unifying Approach to Moment-Based Shape Orientation and Symmetry Classification,"Tzimiropoulos, Georgios; Mitianoudis, Nikolaos; Stathaki, Tania","In this paper, the problem of moment-based shape orientation and symmetry classification is jointly considered. A generalization and modification of current state-of-the-art geometric moment-based functions is introduced. The properties of these functions are investigated thoroughly using Fourier series analysis and several observations and closed-form solutions are derived. We demonstrate the connection between the results presented in this work and symmetry detection principles suggested from previous complex moment-based formulations. The proposed analysis offers a unifying framework for shape orientation/symmetry detection. In the context of symmetry classification and matching, the second part of this work presents a frequency domain method, aiming at computing a robust moment-based feature set based on a true polar Fourier representation of image complex gradients and a novel periodicity detection scheme using subspace analysis. The proposed approach removes the requirement for accurate shape centroid estimation, which is the main limitation of moment-based methods, operating in the image spatial domain. The proposed framework demonstrated improved performance, compared to state-of-the-art methods.",Complex moments; geometric moments; polar Fourier transform; shape orientation; singular value decomposition (SVD); symmetry classification

Exo70 proteins are integral components of the exocyst, an octameric complex that mediates tethering of vesicles to membranes in eukaryotes. Although plant Exo70s are known to be targeted by pathogen effectors, the underpinning molecular mechanisms and the impact of this interaction on infection are poorly understood. Here, we show the molecular basis of the association between the effector AVR-Pii of the blast fungus Maganaporthe oryzae and rice Exo70 alleles OsExo70F2 and OsExo70F3, which is sensed by the immune receptor pair Pii via an integrated RIN4/NOI domain. The crystal structure of AVR-Pii in complex with OsExo70F2 reveals that the effector binds to a conserved hydrophobic pocket in Exo70, defining an effector/target binding interface. Structure-guided and random mutagenesis validates the importance of AVR-Pii residues at the Exo70 binding interface to sustain protein association and disease resistance in rice when challenged with fungal strains expressing effector mutants. Furthermore, the structure of AVR-Pii defines a zinc-finger effector fold (ZiF) distinct from the MAX (Magnaporthe Avrs and ToxB-like) fold previously described for a majority of characterized M. oryzae effectors. Our data suggest that blast fungus ZiF effectors bind a conserved Exo70 interface to manipulate plant exocytosis and that these effectors are also baited by plant immune receptors, pointing to new opportunities for engineering disease resistance.",Exocyst; NLR; effector; plant immunity.

Enzymes and ligands show flexibility in structural behavior as they come in contact with each other. When ligand binds with active site of the enzyme, in the presence of cofactor some structural changes are expected to occur in the active site. Motivation behind this study is to determine the nature of conformational changes as well as regions where such changes are more pronounced. To measure the structural changes due to cofactor and ligand complex, enzyme in apo, holo and ligand-bound forms is selected. Enzyme data set was retrieved from protein data bank. Fifteen triplet groups were selected for the analysis of structural changes based on selection criteria. Structural features for selected enzymes were compared at the global as well as local region. Accessible surface area for the enzymes in entire triplet set was calculated, which describes the change in accessible surface area upon binding of cofactor and ligand with the enzyme. It was observed that some structural changes take place during binding of ligand in the presence of cofactor. This study will helps in understanding the level of flexibility in protein-ligand interaction for computer-aided drug designing.",Active site; Cofactor; Enzymes; Flexibility; Structural changes.

Susceptibility and minimum inhibitory concentration were determined using broth microdilution for all antimicrobial agents by a central reference laboratory according to the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute guidelines and European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing guidelines. Of all the K. pneumoniae isolates (n = 10,906), 44.1% (4,814/10,906) were FQ-R. Of these, 71.3% (3,432/4,814) were extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL)-positive, and 10.4% (499/4,814) were CAZ-AVI-resistant. CAZ-AVI showed high susceptibility (>87%) against all the FQ-R K. pneumoniae isolates. However, metallo- β-lactamase-positive isolates showed low susceptibility (3.8%; 18/470) to CAZ-AVI. Among the different geographical regions, CAZ-AVI showed the highest activity against isolates collected from North America (98.2%, 216/220) and lowest against those collected from Asia Pacific (APAC) (81.7%; 882/1,079). Among comparator agents, carbapenems showed a relatively lower susceptibility (<71.5%), while only tigecycline and colistin were active (>85%) across all isolates. In conclusion, CAZ-AVI may be a potential treatment option for FQ-R K. pneumoniae isolates. However, increasing CAZ-AVI resistance among ESBL-positive and metallo-β-lactamase-positive isolates and in isolates from APAC warrants continuous surveillance.",ATLAS; K. pneumoniae; ceftazidime–avibactam; extended spectrum β-lactamase; fluoroquinolone resistance; metallo-β-lactamase.

447,Dating of rock art and the effect of human activity on vegetation: The complementary use of archaeological and scientific methods,"Hjelle, Kari Loe; Lodoen, Trond Klungseth","One of the main aims of Scandinavian rock art research in recent years has been to identify the culture or society responsible for the imagery. This is of mutual importance, as studies of material culture can shed light on the rock art, while the iconography can be used to understand the contemporary material remains. A major challenge however, has been to determine the exact age of the images, as there are no direct dating materials. In order to overcome this challenge archaeological excavations and palynological analyses have been carried out at Vingen in Western Norway, one of Scandinavia's largest rock art areas. The archaeological and palynological data achieved, as well as loss-on-ignition are independent means for the dating of human activity. Since these methods provided similar results, an indirect connection to the rock art production activity may be inferred. Dates from archaeological contexts indicate a peak of activity between 6900 and 6300 cal. BP, with a potential start 7350 cal. BP and a culmination 6100 cal. BR. Palynological data from three different types of basins have documented forest disturbance in the same time period. Local vegetation reconstructions using the Landscape Reconstruction Algorithm has proved useful to identify anthropogenic-induced land cover changes in the Mesolithic period and a marked reforestation at the transition to the Neolithic period. The applied methods have helped to considerably improve our understanding of past activity and the environment, and demonstrates the potential of archaeological excavations and palynological studies for dating of rock art.

Over the last two decades, studies have reported the potential of AGs in the treatment of genetic disorders caused by nonsense mutations, owing to their ability to induce the ribosomes to read through these mutations and produce a full-length protein. However, the principal limitation in the clinical application of AGs arises from their high toxicity, including nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity. In this study, five novel pseudo-trisaccharide analogs were synthesized by chemo-enzymatic synthesis by acid hydrolysis of commercially available AGs, followed by an enzymatic reaction using recombinant substrate-flexible KanM2 glycosyltransferase. The relationships between their structures and biological activities, including the antibacterial, nephrotoxic, and nonsense readthrough inducer (NRI) activities, were investigated. The absence of 1-N-acylation, 3',4'-dideoxygenation, and post-glycosyl transfer modifications on the third sugar moiety of AGs diminishes their antibacterial activities. The 3',4'-dihydroxy and 6'-hydroxy moieties regulate the in vitro nephrotoxicity of AGs in mammalian cell lines. The 3',4'-dihydroxy and 6'-methyl scaffolds are indispensable for the ex vivo NRI activity of AGs. Based on the alleviated in vitro antibacterial properties and nephrotoxicity, and the highest ex vivo NRI activity among the five compounds, a kanamycin analog (6'-methyl-3''-deamino-3''-hydroxykanamycin C) was selected as a novel AG hit for further studies on human genetic disorders caused by premature transcriptional termination.",6′-methyl-3′′-deamino-3′′-hydroxykanamycin C; KanM2; aminoglycosides; nonsense readthrough inducer activity.
449,8fJ/Step Bandpass ADC With Digitally Assisted NTF Re-Configuration,"Tannirkulam Chandrasekaran, Sanjeev; Kapoor, Gaurav; Sanyal, Arindam","In this work we propose a single channel bandpass (BP) SAR ADC with dynamic noise transfer function (NTF) re-configuration. The proposed ADC employs a low-power two-stage architecture. After the SAR finishes quantization, the residue is extracted by firing the comparator multiple times. An estimate of the residue is obtained by employing a maximum likelihood based estimator (MLE). The output of the ADC is obtained by subtracting a delayed version of the estimated residue from the SAR output thus generating a complex NTF with multiple notches in the spectrum. A 65nm ADC prototype achieves 74.1/78dB SNDR/DR over a 101.2kHz bandwidth while consuming 17 mu W from a 1V supply at 2.43MS/s. The ADC core occupies an area of 0.12mm2.

The convolutional neural network (CNN) approaches based on the U-shape structure have achieved remarkable performances in many different medical image segmentation tasks. However, the context information extraction capability of single stage is insufficient in this structure, due to the problems such as imbalanced class and blurred boundary. In this paper, we propose a novel Context Pyramid Fusion Network (named CPFNet) by combining two pyramidal modules to fuse global/multi-scale context information. Based on the U-shape structure, we first design multiple global pyramid guidance (GPG) modules between the encoder and the decoder, aiming at providing different levels of global context information for the decoder by reconstructing skip-connection. We further design a scale-aware pyramid fusion (SAPF) module to dynamically fuse multi-scale context information in high-level features. These two pyramidal modules can exploit and fuse rich context information progressively. Experimental results show that our proposed method is very competitive with other state-of-the-art methods on four different challenging tasks, including skin lesion segmentation, retinal linear lesion segmentation, multi-class segmentation of thoracic organs at risk and multi-class segmentation of retinal edema lesions.",Image segmentation; Decoding; Task analysis; Lesions; Feature extraction; Medical diagnostic imaging; Medical image segmentation; convolutional neural network; context pyramid fusion network; global pyramid guidance module; scale-aware pyramid fusion module

It is the optimal linear scheme for spatial multiplexing MIMO systems, assuming a fixed number of spatial streams p as well as a fixed modulation and coding across these spatial streams. However, state-of-the-art designs arbitrarily choose and fix the value of the number of spatial streams p, which may lead to an inefficient power allocation strategy and a poor BER performance. We have previously proposed to relax the constraint of fixed number of streams p and to optimize this value under the constraints of fixed average total transmit power and fixed spectral efficiency, which we referred to as spatial-mode selection. Our previous selection criterion was the minimization of the system sum MMSE. In the present contribution, we introduce a new and better spatial-mode selection criterion that targets the minimization of the system BER. We also provide a detailed performance analysis, over flat-fading channels, that confirms that our proposed spatial-mode selection significantly outperforms state-of-the-art joint Tx/Rx MMSE designs for both uncoded and coded systems, thanks to its better exploitation of the MIMO spatial diversity and more efficient power allocation.",MIMO systems; spatial multiplexing; joint transmit and receive optimization; selection

In the solar parabolic dish concentrator, the arrangement of reflectors over the surface area is the significant factor for effective concentration of solar radiation. Also, focal image is one of the most influencing parameters in the design of receiver. Among the various reflectors, the square-shaped reflectors (facets) are comparatively effective in converging the incoming radiations to attain better focal image. In this regard, an attempt has been made to predict the focal image diameter of a solar parabolic dish concentrator with a square facet of different influencing parameters using a novel mathematical model. The influencing parameters considered for the study are aperture diameter, rim angle, and facet length of the dish concentrator. Using the model, the focal image dimension and aperture area of a solar parabolic dish concentrator with square facets can be predicted accurately for efficient design of a solar parabolic dish collector system. Finally, the model is validated with the experimentally obtained focal image diameter. The current model is in good agreement with the experimental value, with a deviation of 8.84%. Hence, the proposed model can be used for the design of parabolic dish systems.",Confocal parameter; Focal image; Fringe size; Paraboloidal dish concentrator; Square facet.
454,Noise Conscious Training of Non Local Neural Network Powered by Self Attentive Spectral Normalized Markovian Patch GAN for Low Dose CT Denoising,"Bera, Sutanu; Biswas, Prabir Kumar","The explosive rise of the use of Computer tomography (CT) imaging in medical practice has heightened public concern over the patient's associated radiation dose. On the other hand, reducing the radiation dose leads to increased noise and artifacts, which adversely degrades the scan's interpretability. In recent times, the deep learning-based technique has emerged as a promising method for low dose CT(LDCT) denoising. However, some common bottleneck still exists, which hinders deep learning-based techniques from furnishing the best performance. In this study, we attempted to mitigate these problems with three novel accretions. First, we propose a novel convolutional module as the first attempt to utilize neighborhood similarity of CT images for denoising tasks. Our proposed module assisted in boosting the denoising by a significant margin. Next, we moved towards the problem of non-stationarity of CT noise and introduced a new noise aware mean square error loss for LDCT denoising. The loss mentioned above also assisted to alleviate the laborious effort required while training CT denoising network using image patches. Lastly, we propose a novel discriminator function for CT denoising tasks. The conventional vanilla discriminator tends to overlook the fine structural details and focus on the global agreement. Our proposed discriminator leverage self-attention and pixel-wise GANs for restoring the diagnostic quality of LDCT images. Our method validated on a publicly available dataset of the 2016 NIH-AAPM-Mayo Clinic Low Dose CT Grand Challenge performed remarkably better than the existing state of the art method.

Maternal hair allows for a retrospective measure of PAE for up to several months. This study examined the validity of hair EtG (hEtG) relative to self-reporting and five other biomarkers in 85 pregnant women. Patients were recruited from a UNM prenatal clinic, which provides care to women with substance abuse and addiction disorders. The composite index, which was based on self-reported measures of alcohol use and allowed us to classify subjects into PAE (n = 42) and control (n = 43) groups, was the criterion measure used to estimate the sensitivity and specificity of hEtG. Proximal segments of hair were collected at enrollment (average 22.0 gestational weeks) and analyzed by LC-MS/MS. At the same visit, maternal blood and urine specimens were collected for analysis of GGT, %dCDT, PEth, uEtG, and uEtS. The study population included mostly opioid-dependent (80%) patients, a large proportion of ethnic minorities (75.3% Hispanic/Latina, 8.2% American Indian, 4.7% African-American), and patients with low education (48.2% < high school). The mean maternal age at enrollment was 26.7 ± 4.8 years. Hair EtG demonstrated 19% sensitivity and 86% specificity. The sensitivities of other biomarkers were comparable (5-20%) to hEtG but specificities were higher (98-100%). Hair EtG sensitivity improved when combined with other biomarkers, especially with GGT (32.5%) and PEth (27.5%). In addition, validity of hEtG improved in patients with less frequent shampooing and those who did not use hair dyes/chemical treatments. These data suggest that hEtG alone is not a sufficiently sensitive or specific biomarker to be used separately for the identification of PAE, but might be useful in a battery along with other maternal biomarkers.",Alcohol; Biomarkers; Ethylglucuronide; Hair; Pregnancy; Prenatal alcohol exposure.

We found that 4 weeks of social isolation decreased ATP levels by 43% and succinate dehydrogenase capacity by 52% of the control, while daily DHM (2 mg/kg oral) administration restored succinate dehydrogenase capacity.

Then, they were treated with 0.30 (CN-0.3) and 0.15 (CN-0.15) μL/mL of CN. CN presented droplet size below 200 nm, monodisperse distribution, and negative surface charge. CN-0.3 reduced the L. monocytogenes counts more efficiently, with counts below the detection limit (1 log cfu/g) in both fruits after 48 h at 4 °C, and 72 h at 8 °C and 12 °C. At 16 °C, L. monocytogenes counts were below the detection limit for CN-0.3 after 120 h in papaya, but it survived the other treatments for 7 days. Both CN-0.3 and CN-0.15 decreased the indigenous microbiota. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) showed bubbles in L. monocytogenes membrane and cell disruption in fruits treated with CN-0.3. Finally, CN-0.3 treated melon and papaya showed greater brightness, herbal flavor and aroma, firmness, and juiciness, as well as lower sugar and organic acid profile changes than the control samples during storage.

The results showed that the research subjects had low patient satisfaction in all the factors assessed compared with the scale's general norms. Among the original seven satisfaction subscales in this study, the highest score was for the financial aspects, and the lowest was for the amount of time spent with doctors. This study also investigated satisfaction with medical lab exams and the pharmacy at the prison's clinic, and the satisfaction scores were higher than the original seven subscales. In multiple logistic regression analyses, the final model indicated that the inmates undergoing observed rehabilitation (OR = 13.837, 95% CI = 2.736-69.983) were more likely satisfied with prison detention clinic c than those serving prison sentences. Those inmates with custodial deposits (high vs. low; OR = 1.813, 95% CI = 1.038-3.168), and meet their physical health needs (met vs. unmet; OR = 4.872, 95% CI = 2.054-11.560) had significant correlated with detention clinic care satisfactory level. Although there is only one study setting cannot give a generalizability for people who are incarcerated in Taiwan, this study highlights that the prison authorities should scrutinize factors associated with detention clinic care satisfaction, such as the type of inmate, economic status in the prison, self-reported health status, and their physical health needs, to increase the level of patient satisfaction.",Detention clinic care; Drug inmate; PSQ-18; Patient satisfaction; Prison.
462,Noise Limits of CMOS Current Interfaces for Biosensors: A Review,"Crescentini, Marco; Bennati, Marco; Carminati, Marco; Tartagni, Marco","Current sensing readout is one of the most frequent techniques used in biosensing due to the charge-transfer phenomena occurring at solid-liquid interfaces. The development of novel nanodevices for biosensing determines new challenges for electronic interface design based on current sensing, especially when compact and efficient arrays need to be organized, such as in recent trends of rapid label-free electronic detection of DNA synthesis. This paper will review the basic noise limitations of current sensing interfaces with particular emphasis on integrated CMOS technology. Starting from the basic theory, the paper presents, investigates and compares charge-sensitive amplifier architectures used in both continuous-time and discrete-time approaches, along with their design trade-offs involving noise floor, sensitivity to stray capacitance and bandwidth. The ultimate goal of this review is providing analog designers with helpful design rules and analytical tools. Also, in order to present a comprehensive overview of the state-of-the-art, the most relevant papers recently appeared in the literature about this topic are discussed and compared.",Biosensors; current amplifiers; noise; sensor interfaces
463,Constant-Parameter Interfacing of Induction Machine Models Considering Main Flux Saturation in EMTP-Type Programs,"Therrien, Francis; Wang, Liwei; Chapariha, Mehrdad; Jatskevich, Juri","The state-of-the-art magnetically linear voltage-behind-reactance (VBR) and phase-domain induction machine models for nodal-analysis-based electromagnetic transients programs (EMTP-type) offer an excellent combination of numerical stability, accuracy, and efficiency. However, incorporation of magnetic saturation in these models renders their interfacing circuits dependent on the operating segment of the piecewise-linear saturation characteristics. Consequently, refactorization of the network's conductance matrix is required during simulations, which reduces the numerical efficiency of the overall solution and limits the models' range of application. This paper presents a new VBR squirrel-cage induction machine model that includes main flux saturation and possesses a saturation-independent constant-parameter interfacing circuit. Case studies in PSCAD/EMTDC demonstrate that the proposed model offers similar numerical stability and accuracy to the state-of-the-art models, while considerably increasing simulation speed for practical multimachine systems.",Constant-parameter interfacing circuit; electromagnetic transients program (EMTP); induction machine; main flux saturation; voltage-behind-reactance (VBR) model
464,Effects of Feed Species and HUFA Composition on Survival and Growth of the Longsnout Seahorse (Hippocampus reidi),"Schubert, Patrick; Vogt, Lena; Eder, Klaus; Hauffe, Torsten; Wilke, Thomas","Globally, wild seahorse populations are threatened due to, habitat destruction and unsustainable human exploitation among others. Furthermore, aquaculture-based mass-scale rearing is still uncommon due to the low survival rates of seahorse juveniles and exceptionally high feed costs. Previous studies have demonstrated the importance of both highly unsaturated fatty acid (HUFA) supplies and a copepod-based rearing for seahorse survival and growth. As the latter is expensive, the question arises as to how high survival rates of seahorse juveniles can be assured under low- to moderate-cost feed regimes. In particular, it remains unknown whether the diet species or their dietary HUFA profiles determine the successful development of seahorse fry. Therefore, the aims of this study were to assess the dependence of growth and survival rates of Hippocampus reidi brood on the animal feed and to infer the impact of feed species vs. dietary HUFA profiles on juvenile growth. A nutrition experiment was conducted where juveniles were treated either with enriched Artemia nauplii (low-cost diet Art) or with a mixed diet of Artemia and copepods (moderate-cost diet Art/Cop). Larval survival and growth were analyzed using Cox proportional-hazard and linear mixed-effect model analyses. We found that (i) both diets enabled good survival, (ii) diet Art/Cop resulted in superior weight and height growth, and (iii) the differential effects of diets Art/Cop and Art cannot be explained by their different HUFA compositions alone. From an economical point of view, our findings of high survival rates and relatively high growth rates with the medium-cost treatment Art/Cop may open new possibilities for the large-scale rearing of seahorses. Even the application of a low-cost Art diet might be appropriate for seahorse aquacultures as both survival and growth rates are only marginally lower compared to the former diet.",aquaculture; Artemia; copepods; diet; highly unsaturated fatty acid; DHA; Eurytemora

Digitalization, modernization, and automation of the manufacturing process are expected to facilitate ICT adoption, resulting in increased genuine environmental concerns. This research aims to examine the impact of ICTs on environmental quality and the relationship between ICTs, environmental quality, and economic growth. Dynamic panel threshold regression was employed, and the sample countries comprised 69 developing countries from 2010 to 2019. The threshold technique will identify the precise threshold value of ICTs and highlights the impacts of ICTs on the environmental quality nexus when above and below the threshold value in developing countries. Empirical evidence suggests that ICTs positively impact environmental quality (CO2) when above the ICTs threshold value. However, ICTs provide a positive but insignificant impact on environmental quality when below the ICTs threshold value of 4.699. Additionally, ICTs affect the economic growth and environmental quality nexus, with increasing economic growth resulting in a decrease in CO2 emissions in developing countries when ICTs are below the threshold value. Thus, the ICTs threshold value should be used to ensure that ICTs adoption promotes sustainable economic growth and resolves environmental degradation issues in developing nations.",CO2 emissions; Dynamic panel threshold regression; Economic growth; Energy consumption; Environmental quality; Financial development; Information and communication technologies.

The rapid initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART) is important to control the HIV epidemic and to optimize the health of people living with HIV; many guidelines now recommend ART initiation within 7 days of HIV diagnosis, with same-day initiation for people diagnosed with HIV who feel ready. Many countries in the Asia-Pacific region have already implemented or are moving towards implementation of rapid or same-day ART initiation. However, there are many obstacles and challenges to its implementation, which vary substantially across the region.

EGF receptor (EGFR) signaling plays an important role in the development of radioresistance. Herein, we have assessed the modulatory effects of silibinin on radiation-induced resistance via DNA repair pathways in EGFR-knockdown DU145 cells. shRNA-based silencing of EGFR was done in radioresistant human PCa DU145 cells and effects of ionizing radiation (IR) and silibinin were assessed using clonogenic and trypan blue assays. Furthermore, radiosensitizing effects of silibinin on PCa in context with EGFR were analyzed using flow cytometry, comet assay, and immunoblotting. Silibinin decreased the colony formation ability with an increased death of DU145 cells exposed to IR (5 Gray), with a concomitant decrease in Rad51 protein expression. Silibinin (25 μM) augmented the IR-induced cytotoxic effect in EGFR-knockdown PCa cells, along with induction of G2/M phase cell cycle arrest. Further, we studied homologous recombination (HR) and non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) pathways in silibinin-induced DNA double-strand breaks in EGFR-knockdown DU145 cells. Silibinin down-regulated the expression of Rad51 and DNA-dependent protein kinase proteins without any considerable effect on Ku70 and Ku80 in IR-exposed EGFR-knockdown PCa cells. The pro-survival signaling proteins, phospho-extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK)1/2, phospho-Akt and phospho-STAT3 were decreased by silibinin in EGFR-deficient PCa cells. These findings suggest a novel mechanism of silibinin-induced radiosensitization of PCa cells by targeting DNA repair pathways, HR and NHEJ, and suppressing the pro-survival signaling pathways, ERK1/2, Akt and STAT3, in EGFR-knockdown PCa cells.",DNA repair pathways; Epidermal growth factor receptor; Prostatic neoplasms; Radiosensitization; Silybin.

Exposure to SGARs has usually been investigated in wildlife species found dead, and despite growing evidence of the potential risk of secondary poisoning of predators and scavengers, the current worldwide exposure of free-living scavenging birds to SGARs remains scarcely investigated. We present the first active monitoring of blood SGAR concentrations and prevalence in the four European obligate (i.e., vultures) and facultative (red and black kites) avian scavengers in NE Spain. We analysed 261 free-living birds and detected SGARs in 39.1% (n = 102) of individuals. Both SGAR prevalence and concentrations (ΣSGARs) were related to the age and foraging behaviour of the species studied. Black kites showed the highest prevalence (100%), followed by red kites (66.7%), Egyptian (64.2%), bearded (20.9%), griffon (16.9%) and cinereous (6.3%) vultures. Overall, both the prevalence and average ΣSGARs were higher in non-nestlings than nestlings, and in species such as kites and Egyptian vultures foraging in anthropic landscapes (e.g., landfill sites and livestock farms) and exploiting small/medium-sized carrions. Brodifacoum was most prevalent (28.8%), followed by difenacoum (16.1%), flocoumafen (12.3%) and bromadiolone (7.3%). In SGAR-positive birds, the ΣSGAR (mean ± SE) was 7.52 ± 0.95 ng mL-1; the highest level detected being 53.50 ng mL-1. The most abundant diastereomer forms were trans-bromadiolone and flocoumafen, and cis-brodifacoum and difenacoum, showing that lower impact formulations could reduce secondary exposures of non-target species. Our findings suggest that SGARs can bioaccumulate in scavenging birds, showing the potential risk to avian scavenging guilds in Europe and elsewhere. We highlight the need for further studies on the potential adverse effects associated with concentrations of SGARSs in the blood to better interpret active monitoring studies of free-living birds.",Anticoagulant rodenticides; Bioaccumulation; Non-target species; Raptors; Scavengers; Vultures.

470,Sublime Experience for Sustainable Underground Space: Integration of the Artists' Works in Chichu Art Museum,"Park, Eun Joo; Kang, Eunki","This paper investigates a vision of the underground environment associated with an aesthetic discipline. Its fundamental notion is sublimity, which was a phenomenon that involved a number of artworks engaged with changing the perception of the underground experience. This paper seeks to clarify how the idea of the living environment underground has changed by examining the works of writers, painters, and architects who have drawn inspiration from the concept of imaginary underworlds. Through a case study of the Chichu Art Museum, a representative underground space in terms of a sustainable relationship between architectural spaces and nature that could be experienced as sublime, this paper considers how to integrate visitors to distribute their awareness of artists' work. It also stimulates visitors' perceptions of a more sustainable future through sublime experiences, offering a way to understand underground integration with artworks.

Methods: A secondary analysis was conducted using a nonprobability sample, the 2017 LGBTQ National Teen Survey, based on 10,027 youth who reported their marijuana use behaviors and state of residence. Random intercept multilevel models were estimated to account for between- and within-state variability. Results: State marijuana possession laws were not associated with lifetime use; however, the odds of current marijuana use were 50% greater among youth living in states with legalized marijuana possession for recreational use (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 1.50; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.21-1.86) compared with states that prohibit any possession. Lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer victimization was associated with greater odds of lifetime (aOR = 1.98; 95% CI: 1.78-2.20) and current (aOR = 1.99; 95% CI: 1.74-2.27) marijuana use.

Encouraged by the stunning success of deep learning techniques based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which have revolutionized the visual data processing community and obtained the state-of-the-art performance in a variety of classification and recognition tasks on benchmark datasets, we propose a network, called EOVNet (EO image-based vehicle detection network), to bridge the gap between the advanced deep learning research of object detection and the specific task of vehicle detection in EO images. Our network has integrated nearly all advanced techniques including very deep residual networks for feature extraction, feature pyramid to fuse multiscale features, network for proposal generation with feature sharing, and hard example mining. Moreover, our novel designs of probability-based localization and homography-based data augmentation have been investigated, resulting in further improvement of the detection performance. For performance evaluation, we have collected nearly all the representative EO datasets associated with vehicle detection. Extensive experiments on the representative datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art object detection approach Faster R-CNN++ (which is based on the Faster R-CNN framework, but with significant improvement) with 5% average precision improvement.

474,Management of perioperative pain after TKA,"Aymard de Ladoucette,Aymard de Ladoucette","Postoperative pain is the prime obstacle to recovery of motion and return to activity after total knee arthroplasty (TKA). Combating pain is a key point in enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) protocols. Outcome depends on the efficacy of pain relief, making it a major issue. The pain originates locally in the knee and also remotely via neural pathways. Regression can be slow, over several months. Pain may sometimes be definitive, to a varying degree. Pain should be managed at each step of ERAS, from the preoperative period to the last follow-up consultation, and most especially during the perioperative phase. Pain needs to be anticipated and limited for as long as necessary. The impact of analgesics should be enhanced by means of potentiators. Some are administered by general route, sometimes preoperatively; others are applied locally, directly in the surgical site by local injection, or close to the nerves, to reduce painful stimuli. The two main principles of pain management are preventive analgesia and multimodal analgesia associating various molecules and routes.",Enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS); Multimodal analgesia; Pain; Preventive analgesia; Total knee arthroplasty.

It has a transition period that allows products that were approved under the previous rules (the EU Medical Device Directives) to continue to be marketed until 26 May 2024 at the latest. As a result of a series of unforeseen factors, there is a possibility that the MDR may result in products becoming unavailable, with the consequent risk of a loss of some interventions that are reliant upon those devices. Devices that are used for orphan or pediatric indications are particularly vulnerable to this. There is an urgent need for policy to be developed to protect essential medical devices for orphan indications and for use in children, to ensure that necessary interventions can continue, and to ensure a more sustainable system in Europe over the longer term. Pediatric cardiologists in Europe need to be aware that particular medical devices may become unavailable over the next two years, and they should contribute to plans to mitigate this risk, so that they can continue to deliver the best possible care for their patients.

Throughout the pandemic, evidence on the effects of COVID-19 during pregnancy has been inadequate due to the limited number of studies published. Therefore, the objective of this systematic review was to evaluate current literature regarding the effects of COVID-19 during pregnancy and establish pregnancy outcomes and vertical and perinatal transmission during pregnancy. Multiple databases were searched, including Embase, Medline, Web of Science, Scopus, and Cochrane Central Register of Control Clinical Trials, using the following keywords: [Pregnancy] AND [COVID-19 OR SARS-CoV-2 OR nCoV-19] OR [Perinatal transmission, Vertical transmission (VT), Pregnancy complications], [Pregnancy] AND [Hyperinflammation OR Cytokine storm]. We excluded in vitro and experimental studies, but also ex-vivo and animal study methods. To exclude the risk of bias during data collection and interpretation, all included studies were peer-reviewed publications. This review is estimated to tabulate the study intervention characteristics and compare them against the planned groups for each synthesis. Our findings showed that pregnant women are commonly susceptible to respiratory viral infections and severe pneumonia due to physiological immune suppression and pregnancy-induced changes. VT of SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy is associated with a great deal of controversy and conflict. However, there is still no robust clinical evidence of VT.

482,FHENet: Lightweight Feature Hierarchical Exploration Network for Real-Time Rail Surface Defect Inspection in RGB-D Images,"Zhou, Wujie; Hong, Jiankang","In recent years, computer vision systems have been increasingly applied to rail defect inspection. Rail defects should be identified quickly and accurately to ensure safe, stable, and fast train operations and thereby reduce the incidence of accidents and economic losses. As most existing methods focus on accuracy, they cannot be deployed on mobile devices with limited computational resources. To solve this problem, we propose a lightweight feature hierarchical exploration network (FHENet) for real-time rail surface defect inspection. First, boundary textures of rail defects are acquired based on the maximum function and maximum pooling in a novel boundary extraction module (BEM), which improves boundary prediction while avoiding heavy computations. Second, a novel cross-modality exploration module (CEM) complements prominent regions through basic operations to avoid complex inference while providing high detection performance. Third, a novel multifeature integration module (MIM) optimizes representative feature regions by using simple operations to avoid complex computations. Results from extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of the proposed FHENet to 14 state-of-the-art methods.

483,Recovery of Damped Exponentials Using Structured Low Rank Matrix Completion,"Balachandrasekaran, Arvind; Magnotta, Vincent; Jacob, Mathews","We introduce a structured low rank matrix completion algorithm to recover a series of images from their under-sampled measurements, where the signal along the parameter dimension at every pixel is described by a linear combination of exponentials. We exploit the exponential behavior of the signal at every pixel, along with the spatial smoothness of the exponential parameters to derive an annihilation relation in the Fourier domain. This relation translates to a low-rank property on a structured matrix constructed from the Fourier samples. We enforce the low-rank property of the structured matrix as a regularization prior to recover the images. Since the direct use of current low rank matrix recovery schemes to this problem is associated with high computational complexity and memory demand, we adopt an iterative re-weighted least squares algorithm, which facilitates the exploitation of the convolutional structure of the matrix. Novel approximations involving 2-D fast Fourier transforms are introduced to drastically reduce the memory demand and computational complexity, which facilitates the extension of structured low-rank methods to large scale 3-D problems. We demonstrate our algorithm in the MR parameter mapping setting and show improvement over the state-of-the-art methods.",Hankel/Toeplitz matrix; regularized recovery; smoothness; parameter mapping

However, some inherent drawbacks including quick activator decomposition and poor anti-interference capacity limited the application of organic compound-activated PDS. It was interestingly found that 2,2'-azino-bis (3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonate) (ABTS) could act as both activator and electron shuttle for PDS activation to enhance diclofenac (DCF) degradation over a pH range of 2.0-11.0. Multiple reactive species of ABTS•+, •OH, and SO4•- were generated in the PDS/ABTS system, while only ABTS•+ and •OH directly contributed to DCF degradation. ABTS•+, generated via the reactions of ABTS with PDS, SO4•-, and •OH, was the dominant reactive species of DCF degradation. No significant decomposition of ABTS was observed in the PDS/ABTS system, and ABTS acted as both activator and electron shuttle. Four possible degradation pathways of DCF were proposed, and the toxicity of DCF decreased after treatment with the PDS/ABTS system. The PDS/ABTS system had good anti-interference capacity to common natural water constituents. Additionally, ABTS was encapsulated into cellulose to obtain ABTS@Ce beads, and the PDS/ABTS@Ce system possessed excellent performance on DCF degradation. This study proposes a new perspective to reconsider the mechanism of activating PDS with organic compounds and highlights the considerable contribution of organic radicals on contaminant removal.",ABTS; electron shuttle; hydroxyl radical; peroxydisulfate activation; sulfate radical.

Plant-mediated nanoparticle synthesis has been applied in recent years to overcome this problem. In this study, the biogenic synthesis of AuNPs was explored using Satureja rechingeri Jamzad aqueous leaf extract, and their anticancer effects were evaluated in cisplatin-resistant A2780CP ovarian cancer cells. The chemical composition of S. rechingeri Jamzad was analyzed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The characteristics of green-synthesized AuNPs were confirmed using XRD, FTIR, UV-visible spectroscopy, TEM, SEM, EDX, DLS, and zeta potential. The cytotoxic effects of AuNPs and S. rechingeri Jamzad aqueous extract on cisplatin-resistant A2780CP ovarian cancer cells were evaluated by MTT assay and flow cytometry. Real-time PCR analyzed gene expression. The chemical composition revealed that carvacrol (89%) was the main component of the S. rechingeri Jamzad extract. The average size of the spherical biosynthesized AuNPs was 15.1 ± 3.7 nm. The AuNPs and plant extract inhibited the growth of cisplatin-resistant ovarian cancer cells in a time- and dose-dependent manner. The apoptotic cell death was confirmed by flow cytometry and DAPI staining. The proapoptotic genes were upregulated, while anti-apoptotic and metastatic genes were downregulated. According to the cell cycle analysis, cancer cells were arrested in the G0/G1 phase. Considering the anticancer activity of the synthesized AuNPs using S. rechingeri Jamzad and the low side effects of AuNPs on normal cells, these AuNPs showed strong potential for use as biological agents in drug-resistant cancer cells treatment.",Apoptosis; Carvacrol; Cell cycle arrest; Cisplatin resistance; Green-synthesized AuNPs; Ovarian cancer cell; Satureja rechingeri Jamzad.
486,TCP-NeuRoc: Neural Adaptive TCP Congestion Control With Online Changepoint Detection,"Li, Wenzhong; Gao, Shaohua; Li, Xiang; Xu, Yeting; Lu, Sanglu","Congestion control is a fundamental mechanism for TCP protocol, which has been extensively studied in the past three decades. However, our experimental evaluations show that the state-of-art congestion control algorithms such as Cubic and BBR are far from optimal: they have unresolved issues such as insufficient usage of available bandwidth, inadaptable to dynamic bandwidth variants, and compromising on one or more performance dimensions. To address these challenges, we propose a novel congestion control mechanism called NeuRoc that coordinately uses online changepoint detection and deep reinforcement learning (DRL) technique to generate the optimal congestion control policy, which allows TCP operating at Kleinrock 's optimal operation point to achieve fully bandwidth usage and low latency. To address the practical issues of deploying the deep learning based congestion control mechanism, we propose a cold-started training and deployment framework to reduce the cost of bootstrap. We implement NeuRoc on an emulation platform which connects to the Linux network protocol stack through virtual network interfaces. Extensive experiments show that NeuRoc achieves the best throughput-latency tradeoff compared with the state-of-the-arts in a variety of scenarios.",Bandwidth; Heuristic algorithms; Throughput; Protocols; Reinforcement learning; Neural networks; Delays; Congestion control; deep reinforcement learning; online changepoint detection

This is well known for polygamous mammals, which are typically sexually dimorphic, and often express great variability in behavior and habitat selection between individuals as well between the sexes. Among monogamous mammals, however, variability in habitat selection should be explained by group characteristics and the presence of offspring rather than by sex. We evaluated this hypothesis in a socially monogamous rodent, the Eurasian beaver (Castor fiber), in a saturated Norwegian population. For the first time in this species we applied GPS tracking devices (N = 22 adult beavers, in 15 territories, 2009-2013), and used resource selection functions (i) to document population-wide habitat selection and the importance of 'territory' therein, and (ii) to evaluate which socio-ecological factors explained potential individual differences in habitat selection. We found that variation in habitat selection was stronger between territories than between years or individuals nested by territory. We identified that family size and the presence of kits, but not sex, explained individual variation in habitat selection. Adults with kits and/or larger families tended to exhibit low risk-taking behavior (avoiding human-related variables such as roads, buildings, and agricultural land), and stayed close to their main lodge (parental care). Our results show that habitat selection is a context-dependent mechanism even in a species which expresses very little behavioral and morphological dimorphism.",Behavioral contexts; Castor fiber; Eurasian beaver; Habitat selection; Monogamy.

Distributing samples across nodes usually yields the best performance, but poses scaling challenges due to global information dissemination and load imbalance across uneven sample lengths. State-of-the-art decentralized optimizers mitigate the problem, but require more iterations to achieve the same accuracy as their globally-communicating counterparts. We present Wait-Avoiding Group Model Averaging (WAGMA) SGD, a wait-avoiding stochastic optimizer that reduces global communication via subgroup weight exchange. The key insight is a combination of algorithmic changes to the averaging scheme and the use of a group allreduce operation. We prove the convergence of WAGMA-SGD, and empirically show that it retains convergence rates similar to Allreduce-SGD. For evaluation, we train ResNet-50 on ImageNet; Transformer for machine translation; and deep reinforcement learning for navigation at scale. Compared with state-of-the-art decentralized SGD variants, WAGMA-SGD significantly improves training throughput (e.g., 2.1x on 1,024 GPUs for reinforcement learning), and achieves the fastest time-to-solution (e.g., the highest score using the shortest training time for Transformer).",Computational modeling; Training; Convergence; Program processors; Stochastic processes; Deep learning; Task analysis; Stochastic gradient descent; distributed deep learning; decentralized optimization

First, a case is made that even banded systems can be greatly impacted by a modest amount of tuning. This is done by showing the results of a traditional fixed system in an unlicensed band upgraded with a programmable front-end filter. Next, a system built specifically for wideband tuning is shown that enables band selection across the 20-MHz-6-GHz-band. Cooperative operation of multiple colocated nodes is enabled by high-quality pre-LNA filtering across the bands of operation. Future capabilities of adaptable systems are shown by reviewing the state of the art of adaptable systems, heading toward a field-programmable filter array in which a sea of resonators are dynamically interconnected to create a transfer function on demand. Additionally, a novel synthesis approach is highlighted in which multiple filters can cooperate gracefully without crossover issues between the bands. This approach allows for a vast number of filter states by turning on and off pass-bands without affecting the adjacent bands. The advancements in adaptable hardware will enable new classes of RF systems which much more efficiently utilize the spectrum.",Cognitive radio; microstrip filters; radio spectrum management; resonator filters; software radio

492,Single-Cell Analysis of Histone Acetylation Dynamics at Replication Forks Using PLA and SIRF,"Seo Yun Lee,Jae Jin Kim,Kyle M Miller,Seo Yun Lee,Jae Jin Kim,Kyle M Miller","Genome integrity is constantly challenged by various processes including DNA damage, structured DNA, transcription, and DNA-protein crosslinks. During DNA replication, active replication forks that encounter these obstacles can result in their stalling and collapse. Accurate DNA replication requires the ability of forks to navigate these threats, which is aided by DNA repair proteins. Histone acetylation participates in this process through an ability to signal and recruit proteins to regions of replicating DNA. For example, the histone acetyltransferase PCAF promotes the recruitment of the DNA repair factors MRE11 and EXO1 to stalled forks by acetylating histone H4 at lysine 8 (H4K8ac). These highly dynamic processes can be detected and analyzed using a modified proximity ligation assay (PLA) method, known as SIRF (in situ protein interactions with nascent DNA replication forks). This single-cell assay combines PLA with EdU-coupled Click-iT chemistry reactions and fluorescence microscopy to detect these interactions at sites of replicating DNA. Here we provide a detailed protocol utilizing SIRF that detects the HAT PCAF and histone acetylation at replication forks. This technique provides a robust methodology to determine protein recruitment and modifications at the replication fork with single-cell resolution.",DNA replication; Genome integrity; Histone acetylation; PCAF; PLA; Replication stress; SIRF; Stalled replication forks.

All of 2274 children with ASD and 1086 healthy controls were recruited. Sociodemographic and prenatal, perinatal, and neonatal characteristics were compared between the two groups. Multivariable logistic regression analyses were applied to investigate association between miscarriage history and ASD. Stratified analyses based on sex and types of miscarriages were similarly performed. History of miscarriage was potential risk factors for ASD ([aOR] = 2.919; 95% [CI] = 2.327-3.517). Stratified analyses revealed that induced ([aOR] = 2.763, 95% [CI] = 2.259-3.379) and spontaneous miscarriage history ([aOR] = 3.341, 95% [CI] = 1.939-4.820) were associated with high risk of ASD, respectively. A sex-biased ratio in the risk of ASD was observed between females ([aOR] = 3.049, 95% [CI] = 2.153-4.137) and males ([aOR] = 2.538, 95% [CI] = 1.978-3.251). Stratified analysis of induced miscarriage history revealed that only iatrogenic miscarriage history was associated with an increased risk ASD ([aOR] = 2.843, 95% [CI] = 1.534-4.268). Also, multiple spontaneous miscarriage histories ([aOR] = 1.836, 95% [CI] = 1.252-2.693) were associated with higher autism risk than one spontaneous miscarriages history ([aOR] = 3.016, 95% [CI] = 1.894-4.174).

While high-fidelity small-molecule modulators of miRNAs can be identified via high-throughput screening using cellular reporter systems, their modes of action are elusive due to the lack of proper tools. Here, we report a small-molecule probe, 1 a, that is capable of elucidating its biological target along miRNA inhibition. Derived from norathyriol, a nature product, 1 a possessed a bioorthogonal alkyne moiety for subsequent labeling via copper-catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddition chemistry. We demonstrated that 1 a inhibited a panel of different miRNAs by blocking their loading onto argonaute 2 (AGO2), which is the key protein responsible for miRNA function. With the alkyne handle, we successfully identified AGO2 as an intracellular target of 1 a. Therefore, this work presents a novel small-molecule tool for suppressing and probing miRNA regulatory pathways.",AGO2 protein; bio-orthogonal Group; cancer therapy; microRNAs; small molecule Inhibitor.

These algorithms also enable effective computer vision tasks for future robotic surgery. In this article, we present a new unsupervised learning framework for high-quality pixel-wise smoke detection and removal. One of the well recognized grand challenges in using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for medical image processing is to obtain intra-operative medical imaging datasets for network training and validation, but availability and quality of these datasets are scarce. Our novel training framework does not require ground-truth image pairs. Instead, it learns purely from computer-generated simulation images. This approach opens up new avenues and bridges a substantial gap between conventional non-learning based methods and which requiring prior knowledge gained from extensive training datasets. Inspired by the Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), we have developed a novel generative-collaborative learning scheme that decomposes the de-smoke process into two separate tasks: smoke detection and smoke removal. The detection network is used as prior knowledge, and also as a loss function to maximize its support for training of the smoke removal network. Quantitative and qualitative studies show that the proposed training framework outperforms the state-of-the-art de-smoking approaches including the latest GAN framework (such as PIX2PIX). Although trained on synthetic images, experimental results on clinical images have proved the effectiveness of the proposed network for detecting and removing surgical smoke on both simulated and real-world laparoscopic images.",Endoscopy; image enhancement; machine learning; de-smoking

There are no specific longitudinal parameters known to help predict RV pacing-induced LV dysfunction. The aim of the study was to assess the acute effects of AV synchronous RV pacing on LV mechanics using echocardiographic speckle tracking. Nineteen children, aged 6-23 years, underwent echocardiographic evaluation prior to and following elective electrophysiology and ablation studies. The subjects were evaluated in sinus rhythm and later with AV synchronous RV pacing at a cycle length of 550 ms with a short AV delay of 80 ms. The echocardiographic clips were analyzed using speckle tracking methods to calculate LV circumferential and longitudinal strain, rotation and twist in all conditions. Acute RV apical pacing decreased LV longitudinal strain from 16.1 ± 3.7% in sinus rhythm to 14.4 ± 3.3% (p = 0.03) and LV base rotation from -8.4° ± 3.6° to -6.4° ± 4.0° (p = 0.04). The circumferential strain, apical rotation and LV twist were not affected. Separate analysis of subjects with no prior preexcitation showed that acute RV pacing caused significant twist reduction, from 15.9° ± 7.6° to 12.1° ± 7.0° (p = 0.02), and decreased longitudinal strain and base rotation. Patients with preexcitation had abnormalities that persisted acutely after ablation. Acute RV apical pacing causes reductions in LV base rotation, longitudinal strain and twist.

With the specific aim of a better molecular understanding of this effect caused by the presence of TSC, theoretical calculations were also performed in this study. Based on these findings, it is concluded that the presence of TSC moieties contributes to significant changes in the hydrogen atom charge of PMB structure, which trend more positives for the PMB/TSC system studied. This could lead to the formation of stronger hydrogen bonds in the Enterobacterales active site and, thus contribute to a molecular understanding of the PMB rescue of activity promoted by the presence of TSC moiety.

Earlier diagnoses melanoma can expand treatment options, improve the quality of patients' lives, and reduce their treatment costs. Although several prior works have reached the state-of-the-art lesion segmentation achievement with convolutional neural network (CNN), developing an automatic segmentation solution is still challenging because pixel-level annotation of medical images is expensive and time-consuming. In this article, we solve the aforementioned problems by a jigsaw-invariant self-supervised learning of autoencoder-based reconstruction (JIANet) with the unlabeled melanoma images. Specifically, JIANet incorporates a jigsaw-invariant instance discrimination task to explore image-level features and an autoencoding reconstruct task to discover pixel-level features, which capture discriminative representations and explore the pixel details from unlabeled melanoma images.

506,Temporal aspects of two types of backward crosstalk in dual-tasks: An analysis of continuous mouse-tracking data,"Carolin Schonard,Rolf Ulrich,Markus Janczyk,Carolin Schonard,Rolf Ulrich,Markus Janczyk","A common explanation for processing limitations in dual-tasking is the existence of a bottleneck during response selection, meaning that the selection of responses can only occur serially for different tasks. However, a large body of data shows that features of a (secondary) Task 2 can already influence the processing of a (primary) Task 1. Such effects are referred to as backward crosstalk effects (BCEs). In the present study, two types of such BCEs were investigated: the compatibility-based BCE, which depends on the dimensional (often spatial) overlap between task features, and a BCE based on a go/no-go task in Task 2 (no-go BCE). Joining a line of research that suggests different mechanisms for these two types of BCEs, we investigated them using a mouse-tracking setup. Time continuous analyses revealed that the compatibility-based BCE triggered a spatial activation of the Task 2 response early during Task 1 processing, whereas the no-go BCE triggered an inhibitory effect in the case of a no-go Task 2, which spills over to Task 1 execution. This occurred, however, earlier in the time course than expected. The results are discussed with regard to recent models of dual-task processing.",Dual-task; backward crosstalk; mouse tracking; multitasking; no-go task.
507,Approaches to investigating metabolism in human neurodevelopment using organoids: insights from intestinal and cancer studies,"Alexandria Morales,Madeline G Andrews,Alexandria Morales,Madeline G Andrews","Interrogating the impact of metabolism during development is important for understanding cellular and tissue formation, organ and systemic homeostasis, and dysregulation in disease states. To evaluate the vital functions metabolism coordinates during human brain development and disease, pluripotent stem cell-derived models, such as organoids, provide tractable access to neurodevelopmental processes. Despite many strengths of neural organoid models, the extent of their replication of endogenous metabolic programs is currently unclear and requires direct investigation. Studies in intestinal and cancer organoids that functionally evaluate dynamic bioenergetic changes provide a framework that can be adapted for the study of neural metabolism. Validation of in vitro models remains a significant challenge; investigation using in vivo models and primary tissue samples is required to improve our in vitro model systems and, concomitantly, improve our understanding of human development.",In vitro models; Metabolism; Neural development; Organoids.
508,Desalination by using alternative energy: Review and state-of-the-art,"Mathioulakis, E.; Belessiotis, V.; Delyannis, E.","Energy is a critical parameter for economic and of vital importance in social and industrial development, as it is also quality water. Numerous low-density population areas lack not only fresh water availability, but in most of the cases electrical grid connection or any other energy source as well, except for renewable energy sources, mostly referring to solar radiation. For these regions desalination is a moderate solution for their needs. In using RE desalination there are two separate and different technologies involved: energy conversion and desalination systems. The real problem in these technologies is the optimum economic design and evaluation of the combined plants in order to be economically viable for remote or and regions. Conversion of renewable energies, including solar, requires high investment cost and though the intensive R&D effort technology is not yet enough mature to be exploited through large-scale applications. This paper presents a review of the highlights that have been achieved during the recent years and the state-of-the-art for most important efforts in the field of desalination by renewable energies, with emphasis on solar energy applications.",desalination; alternative energy; review
509,"What happened at 1500-1000 cal. BP in Central Australia? Timing, impact and archaeological signatures","Smith, M. A.; Ross, J.","This paper reviews the late Holocene archaeology of Central Australia. The last 1500 years saw significant changes in the archaeological record in this part of the Australian and zone, with shifts in settlement pattern, site histories, resource use, tool inventories and rock art. Much of the evidence points to regional population growth, beginning 1500-1000 cal. BP and coinciding with expansion of summer-rainfall grassland and more frequent palaeoflood events. Hunter-gatherer groups appear to have increased their use of marginal or outlying areas as these became seasonally accessible. Responses to the demographic changes, especially in the better-watered ranges, include more extended occupation of existing sites, more processing of acacia and grass seeds, and an increase in territoriality reflected in the greater differentiation of rock art complexes after 1500 cal. BP. The archaeological changes are not scaled commensurately with the modest environmental shifts at this time, indicating that human-environment interactions were not linear. A human-environment threshold may have been breached 1500-1000 years ago, with existing socio-economic or historical factors acting to amplify the effects of small environmental changes. However, it remains difficult to fully characterize the nature of these human-environment interactions, despite the fine-grained archaeological record now available. An unresolved problem for this emerging picture of climatic amelioration and population growth is that Aboriginal settlement in Central Australia was expanding at a time when ENSO-driven variability appears to have been at its highest.",Australian archaeology; arid zone; hunter-gatherer demography; ENSO; late-Holocene climates; rock art; human-environment interactions; Central Australia
510,Stratified pooling based deep convolutional neural networks for human action recognition,"Yu, Sheng; Cheng, Yun; Su, Songzhi; Cai, Guorong; Li, Shaozi","Video based human action recognition is an active and challenging topic in computer vision. Over the last few years, deep convolutional neural networks (CNN) has become the most popular method and achieved the state-of-the-art performance on several datasets, such as HMDB-51 and UCF-101. Since each video has a various number of frame-level features, how to combine these features to acquire good video-level feature becomes a challenging task. Therefore, this paper proposed a novel action recognition method named stratified pooling, which is based on deep convolutional neural networks (SP-CNN). The process is mainly composed of five parts: (i) fine-tuning a pre-trained CNN on the target dataset, (ii) frame-level features extraction; (iii) the principal component analysis (PCA) method for feature dimensionality reduction; (iv) stratified pooling frame-level features to get video-level feature; and (v) SVM for multiclass classification. Finally, the experimental results conducted on HMDB-51 and UCF-101 datasets show that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art.",Human action recognition; Convolutional neural networks (CNN); Stratified pooling (SP); Support vector machines (SVM)

Unlike several state-of-the-art approaches, the voltages at the output of the receiving sensors are directly used to determine the DoAs of the signals thus avoiding the computation of the correlation matrix. Towards this end, the estimation problem is properly formulated to enforce the sparsity of the solution in the linear relationships between output voltages (i.e., the problem data) and the unknown DoAs. Customized implementations exploiting the measurements collected at a unique time instant (single-snapshot) and multiple time instants (multiple-snapshots) are presented and discussed. The effectiveness of the proposed approaches is assessed through an extensive numerical analysis addressing different scenarios, signal configurations, and noise conditions.

Tetraspanins constitute a family of proteins with four transmembrane domains present in every cell type. Prominent examples are tetraspanin4 and CD9, which are required for the fundamental cellular processes of migrasome formation and fertilization, respectively. These proteins are enriched in curved membrane structures, such as cellular retraction fibers and oocyte microvilli. The factors driving this enrichment are, however, unknown. Here, we revealed that tetraspanin4 and CD9 are curvature sensors with a preference for positive membrane curvature. To this end, we used a biomimetic system emulating membranes of cell retraction fibers and oocyte microvilli by membrane tubes pulled out of giant plasma membrane vesicles with controllable membrane tension and curvature. We developed a simple thermodynamic model for the partitioning of curvature sensors between flat and tubular membranes, which allowed us to estimate the individual intrinsic curvatures of the two proteins. Overall, our findings illuminate the process of migrasome formation and oocyte microvilli shaping and provide insight into the role of tetraspanin proteins in membrane remodeling processes.",membrane curvature; migrasomes; optical tweezers; tetraspanin.

Chemical weathering dynamics in the Ladakh region is poorly understood, due to unavailability of in situ dataset. The aim of the present study is to investigate how the two distinct catchments (Lato and Stok) drive the meltwater chemistry of the Indus River and its tributary, in the Western Himalayas. Water samples were collected from two glaciated catchments (Lato and Stok), Chabe Nama (tributary) and the Indus River in Ladakh. The mildly alkaline pH (range 7.3-8.5) and fluctuating ionic trend of the meltwater samples reflected the distinct geology and weathering patterns of the Upper Indus Basin (UIB). Gibbs plot and mixing diagram revealed rock weathering outweighed evaporation and precipitation. The strong associations between Ca2+-HCO3-, Mg2+-HCO3-, Ca2+-Mg2+, Na+-HCO3-, and Mg2+-Na+ demonstrated carbonate rock weathering contributed to the major ion influx. Principal component analysis (PCA) marked carbonate and silicates as the most abundant minerals respectively. Chemical weathering patterns were predominantly controlled by percentage of glacierized area and basin runoff. Thus, Lato with the larger glacierized area (~ 25%) and higher runoff contributed low TDS, HCO3-, Ca2+, and Na+ and exhibited higher chemical weathering, whereas lower chemical weathering was evinced at Stok with the smaller glacierized area (~ 5%). In contrast, the carbonate weathering rate (CWR) of larger glacierized catchments (Lato) exhibits higher average value of 15.7 t/km2/year as compared to smaller glacierized catchment (Stok) with lower average value 6.69 t/km2/year. However, CWR is high in both the catchments compared to silicate weathering rate (SWR). For the first time, in situ datasets for stream water chemical characteristics have been generated for Lato and Stok glaciated catchments in Ladakh, to facilitate healthy ecosystems and livelihoods in the UIB.",C-ratio; Chemical weathering; Hydrochemistry; Major ions; Upper Indus Basin.

Therefore, having sufficient information about the normal measurements of the adrenal gland and their relationship with indicators such as weight, sex and the diameter of the internal abdominal aorta will be of great help in diagnosing diseases of the adrenal gland. In the present study, 21 healthy adult intact rabbits were selected. The abdominal cavity of the animals was examined using ultrasound; adrenal gland parameters such as length, width, height, circumference and area on the right and left sides were measured in both sagittal and transverse planes. Additionally, the diameter of the abdominal aorta in the sagittal plane was imaged. After statistical analysis, the parameters of the adrenal glands on the right and left showed a positive significant correlation with the weight and the diameter of the abdominal aorta, although no significant correlation was found between these parameters and sex. The ratio of adrenal gland parameters to abdominal aortic diameter was calculated and the statistical analysis of the values showed that, except for the ratio of left adrenal area to aortic diameter, the other ratio of adrenal gland parameters to abdominal aortic diameter was not significantly related to weight. Therefore, these ratios can be used as suitable indicators for assessing the change in size of the adrenal gland of rabbits of different sizes. Knowing the relationship between normal adrenal measurements and the indices such as weight, sex and diameter of the abdominal aorta can help clinicians and researchers evaluate the changes in the size of the adrenal gland.",adrenal gland; aorta; rabbit; ultrasonography.
519,TArgeted Motion Estimation and Reduction (TAMER): Data Consistency Based Motion Mitigation for MRI Using a Reduced Model Joint Optimization,"Haskell, Melissa W.; Cauley, Stephen F.; Wald, Lawrence L.","We introduce a data consistency based retrospective motion correction method, TArgeted Motion Estimation and Reduction (TAMER), to correct for patient motion in Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). Specifically, a motion free image and motion trajectory are jointly estimated by minimizing the data consistency error of a SENSE forward model including rigid-body subject motion. In order to efficiently solve this large non-linear optimization problem, we employ reduced modeling in the parallel imaging formulation by assessing only a subset of target voxels at each step of the motion search. With this strategy we are able to effectively capture the tight coupling between the image voxel values and motion parameters. We demonstrate in simulations TAMER's ability to find similar search directions compared to a full model, with an average error of 22%, vs. 73% error when using previously proposed alternating methods. The reduced model decreased the computation time 17x fold compared to a full image volume evaluation. In phantom experiments, our method successfully mitigates both translation and rotation artifacts, reducing image RMSE compared to a motion-free gold standard from 21% to 14% in a translating phantom, and from 17% to 10% in a rotating phantom. Qualitative image improvements are seen in human imaging of moving subjects compared to conventional reconstruction. Finally, we compare in vivo image results of our method to the state-of-the-art.",Motion correction; model reduction; joint optimization; magnetic resonance imaging (MRI); image reconstruction; forward modeling
520,Estimating CT Image From MRI Data Using Structured Random Forest and Auto-Context Model,"Tri Huynh; Gao, Yaozong; Kang, Jiayin; Wang, Li; Zhang, Pei; Lian, Jun; Shen, Dinggang","Computed tomography (CT) imaging is an essential tool in various clinical diagnoses and radiotherapy treatment planning. Since CT image intensities are directly related to positron emission tomography (PET) attenuation coefficients, they are indispensable for attenuation correction (AC) of the PET images. However, due to the relatively high dose of radiation exposure in CT scan, it is advised to limit the acquisition of CT images. In addition, in the new PET and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging scanner, only MR images are available, which are unfortunately not directly applicable to AC. These issues greatly motivate the development of methods for reliable estimate of CT image from its corresponding MR image of the same subject. In this paper, we propose a learning-based method to tackle this challenging problem. Specifically, we first partition a given MR image into a set of patches. Then, for each patch, we use the structured random forest to directly predict a CT patch as a structured output, where a new ensemble model is also used to ensure the robust prediction. Image features are innovatively crafted to achieve multi-level sensitivity, with spatial information integrated through only rigid-body alignment to help avoiding the error-prone inter-subject deformable registration. Moreover, we use an auto-context model to iteratively refine the prediction. Finally, we combine all of the predicted CT patches to obtain the final prediction for the given MR image. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method on two datasets: human brain and prostate images. Experimental results show that our method can accurately predict CT images in various scenarios, even for the images undergoing large shape variation, and also outperforms two state-of-the-art methods.",Auto-context; CT prediction; dose planning; PET attenuation correction; random forest

524,A Novel Machine Learning Approach for Android Malware Detection Based on the Co-Existence of Features,"Odat, Esraa; Yaseen, Qussai M.","This paper proposes a machine learning model based on the co-existence of static features for Android malware detection. The proposed model assumes that Android malware requests an abnormal set of co-existed permissions and APIs in comparing to those requested by benign applications. To prove this assumption, the paper created a new dataset of co-existed permissions and API calls at different levels of combinations, which are the second level, the third level, the fourth level and the fifth level. The extracted datasets of co-existed features at different levels were applied on permissions only, APIs only, permissions and APIs, and APIs and APIs frequencies. To extract the most relevant co-existed features, the frequent pattern growth (FP-growth) algorithm, which is an association rule mining technique, was used. The new datasets were extracted using Android APK samples from the Drebin, Malgenome and MalDroid2020 datasets. To evaluate the proposed model, several conventional machine learning algorithms were used. The results show that the model can successfully classify Android malware with a high accuracy using machine learning algorithms and the co-existence of features. Moreover, the results show that the achieved classification accuracy depends on the classifier and the type of co-existed features. The maximum accuracy, which is 98%, was achieved using the Random Forest algorithm and the co-existence of permissions features at the second combination level. Furthermore, the results show that the proposed approach outperforms the state-of-the-art model. Using Malgenome dataset, the proposed approach achieved an accuracy of about 98%, while the state-of-the-art achieved an accuracy of about 87%. In addition, the experiments show that using the Drebin dataset, the proposed approach achieved an accuracy of about 95%, while the state-of-the-art achieved an accuracy of about 93%.",Malware; Feature extraction; Machine learning algorithms; Smart phones; Machine learning; Heuristic algorithms; Computational modeling; Android; co-existence; FP-growth; machine learning; malware

They all feature similar performance in terms of insulating capabilities, but otherwise present significant differences. These are discussed in detail in the following paper. Despite the fact that the thermal properties of the materials has not improved significantly of the last decade, a series of other features, like reaction to fire and moisture or mechanical properties have improved, sometimes even at the cost of insulation abilities. Furthermore, environmental and public health aspects play an increasing role, both in the search for 'optimum' materials for given applications, and in the aims set by the industry for future developments.

To alleviate this problem, researchers proposed various domain adaptation methods to improve object detection results in the cross-domain setting, e.g. by translating images with ground-truth labels from the source domain to the target domain using Cycle-GAN. On top of combining Cycle-GAN transformations and self-paced learning in a smart and efficient way, in this paper, we propose a novel self-paced algorithm that learns from easy to hard. Our method is simple and effective, without any overhead during inference. It uses only pseudo-labels for samples taken from the target domain, i.e. the domain adaptation is unsupervised. We conduct experiments on four cross-domain benchmarks, showing better results than the state of the art. We also perform an ablation study demonstrating the utility of each component in our framework. Additionally, we study the applicability of our framework to other object detectors. Furthermore, we compare our difficulty measure with other measures from the related literature, proving that it yields superior results and that it correlates well with the performance metric.",Object detection; Cross-domain; Unsupervised domain adaptation; Curriculum learning; Self-paced learning

It has shown its effectiveness in both prediction and classification problems. However, in some fields there is still some reticence towards their use mainly the fact that they do not justify their answers. The lack of transparency on how ANN makes decisions motivated us to develop our rule extraction algorithm that extracts comprehensible rules with high accuracy and high fidelity. The aim is to generate a set of rules that mimic the decision of ANN and cover a larger set of patterns. The obtained rule sets should satisfy a well-balanced trade-off between the fidelity, the accuracy and the comprehensibility. The proposed algorithm consists of a three steps: ANN learning phase, rule extraction phase and rule simplification phase. The rule extraction phase is based on the extraction of the association rules while the rules simplification procedure is based on the laws of Boolean algebra. To evaluate the performance of our algorithm, the system has been studied using four datasets, and then compared with other rule extraction methods. The results show that our proposal offers a small set of rules having the highest accuracy and fidelity values.",Neural networks; genetic algorithm; multiobjective optimization; rule extraction.

Between these two extremes a range of scenarios is possible. During the early waves of SARS-CoV-2, the underlying paradigm was for long-lasting immunity, but more recent data and in particular the 2022 Omicron waves have shown that reinfection can be relatively common. Here we investigate reported SARS-CoV-2 cases in England, partitioning the data into four main waves, and consider the temporal distribution of first and second reports of infection. We show that a simple low-dimensional statistical model of random (but scaled) reinfection captures much of the observed dynamics, with the value of this scaling, k, providing information of underlying epidemiological patterns. We conclude that there is considerable heterogeneity in risk of reporting reinfection by wave, age-group and location. The high levels of reinfection in the Omicron wave (we estimate that 18% of all Omicron cases had been previously infected, although not necessarily previously reported infection) point to reinfection events dominating future COVID-19 dynamics.

In addition, the operation parameters of PEC and the reaction conditions of PEC-CP were optimized based on iron plate as electrode and total hardness, turbidity and sludge yield as assessment indicators. Due to the formation of multi-hydroxyl iron by several minutes of pulse current, and the addition of pH regulator and coagulant aid, the efficient removal of various ions, hardness and turbidity was significantly reduced via various mechanism such as redox, precipitation, adsorption and coagulation reaction. The result indicated that under the optimal operation conditions, the total hardness, turbidity, and Fen+ of PEC-CP effluents were 275.0 mg/L, 3.0 NTU and 5.6 mg/L, respectively and sludge amount was 0.88 kg/m3. The removal rates of Si, B, Mn, Ba, COD, NPOC and NH4+-N by PEC-CP reached 80.0%, 75.4%, 97.0%, 99.8%, 35.0%, 33.6% and 23.8%, respectively. The present results suggested that the CGGW pretreatment effluents could be not only reused directly, but also greatly alleviate the scaling problem of water pipeline and coal gasification production facilities.",Chemical precipitation; Coal gasification gray water; Pulse electrocoagulation; Sludge analysis.
533,Efficient methods for mining weighted clickstream patterns,"Huynh, Huy M.; Nguyen, Loan T. T.; Vo, Bay; Anh Nguyen; Tseng, Vincent S.","Pattern mining has been an attractive topic for many researchers since its first introduction. Clickstream mining, a specific version of sequential pattern mining, has been shown to be important in the age of the Internet. However, most previous works have simply exploited and applied existing sequential pattern algorithms to the mining of clickstream patterns, and few have studied clickstreams with weights, which also have a wide range of application. In this paper, we address this problem by proposing an approach based on the average weight measure for clickstream pattern mining and adapting a previous state-of-the-art algorithm to deal with the problem of weighted clickstream pattern mining. Following this, we propose an improved method named Compact-SPADE to enhance both the efficiency and memory consumption. Through various tests on both real-life and synthetic databases, we show that our proposed algorithms outperform state-of-the-art alternatives in terms of efficiency, memory requirements and scalability.

A study was conducted on 41 patients with brain glioma located in the language area that had awake surgery under conscious sedation. Surgery was ended early in 6 patients. The causes were: tonic-clonic seizure (1), lack of cooperation due to fatigue/sleep (4), whether or not word articulation was involved, a decreased level of consciousness for ammonia encephalopathy that required endotracheal intubation (1). There are causes that could be expected and in some cases avoided. Tumour size, preoperative aphasia, valproate treatment, and type of anaesthesia used are variables to consider to avoid failure in awake surgery for language mapping. With these results, the following measures are proposed: l) If the tumour is large, perform surgery in two times to avoid fatigue, 2) if patient has a preoperative aphasia, do not use sedation during surgery to ensure that sleepiness does not cause worse word articulation, 3) if the patient is on valproate treatment, it is necessary to rule out the pre-operative symptoms that are not due to ammonia encephalopathy.",Afasia; Aphasia; Awake surgery; Brain glioma; Conscious sedation; Craneotomía con paciente despierto; Eloquence area; Glioma cerebral; Language mapping; Mapeo lenguaje; Sedación consciente; Área elocuente.

Considering the lack of extensive studies on cogwheel data by means of ART in combination with machine learning (ML), we utilize time-frequency domain feature analysis and apply ML algorithms to the obtained feature sets in order to detect damaged samples in two ways: one-class and binary classification. In each case, despite small data, our approach delivers robust performance: All damaged test samples reflecting real-world scenarios are recognized in two one-class classifiers (also called detectors), and one intact test sample is misclassified in binary ones. This shows the usefulness of ML and time-frequency domain feature analysis in ART on a sintered cogwheel dataset.",acoustic resonance testing (ART); deep learning; machine learning; small data; non-destructive testing (NDT)

Even though the number of online platforms and programs has grown during the COVID-19 pandemic, there is still a high rate of dropout and non-completion. In this work, the expectation-confirmation model is combined with MOOC features such as perceived openness, perceived reputation, and other factors i.e., perceived enjoyment, and perceived computer self-efficacy to investigate the learner's continued intention to use MOOC. A survey was undertaken and the data was collected from 383 students pursuing their degrees (undergraduate and post-graduate) in Karnataka state, India. The collected data were analyzed with structural equation modelling in Smart PLS 3. The study confirms a significant influence of confirmation and perceived usefulness on satisfaction, and direct significant influence of perceived computer self-efficacy, satisfaction, and perceived usefulness on continuance intention. Also, the results demonstrated the significant influence of confirmation on perceived enjoyment and usefulness and the effect of computer self-efficacy on usefulness.

However, challenges arise when trying to quantify the health effects of complex exposure mixtures. Analytical challenges include dealing with high dimensionality, studying the combined effects of these exposures and their interactions, integrating causal pathways, and integrating high-throughput omits layers. To tackle these challenges, the Barcelona Institute for Global Health (ISGlobal) held a data challenge event open to researchers from all over the world and from all expertises. Analysts had a chance to compete and apply state-of-the-art methods on a common partially simulated exposome dataset (based on real case data from the HELIX project) with multiple correlated exposure variables (P > 100 exposure variables) arising from general and personal environments at different time points, biological molecular data (multi-omics: DNA methylation, gene expression, proteins, metabolomics) and multiple clinical phenotypes in 1301 mother-child pairs. Most of the methods presented included feature selection or feature reduction to deal with the high dimensionality of the exposome dataset. Several approaches explicitly searched for combined effects of exposures and/or their interactions using linear index models or response surface methods, including Bayesian methods. Other methods dealt with the multi-omits dataset in mediation analyses using multiple-step approaches. Here we discuss features of the statistical models used and provide the data and codes used, so that analysts have examples of implementation and can learn how to use these methods. Overall, the exposome data challenge presented a unique opportunity for researchers from different disciplines to create and share state-of-the-art analytical methods, setting a new standard for open science in the exposome and environmental health field.",Exposome; Statistical models; Multi-omics; Multiple exposures; Environmental exposures

This problem has been proved NP-complete problem, where a set of target points are given, the objective is to find optimal number of suitable positions to organize sensor nodes such that it must satisfy both k-coverage and m-connectivity requirements. In this paper, a biogeography-based optimization (BBO) scheme is used to solve this problem. The proposed BBO-based scheme provides an efficient encoding scheme for the habitat representation and formulates an objective function along with the BBO's migration and mutation operators. Simulation results show the performance of the proposed scheme to find approximate optimal number of suitable positions under different combinations of k and m. In addition, a comparative study with state-of-art schemes has also been done and its analysis confirms the superiority of the proposed BBO-based scheme over state-of-art schemes.",Coverage and connectivity problem; Wireless sensor network; Biogeography-based optimization

It was characterised by a magnificent and original artistic production that took its inspiration from aspects of the natural environment inserted into mythological contexts of various origins. In Etruscan art, birds occupied a significant place, and were often represented in wall paintings and craft objects. Species still occurring on the Italian mainland, such as swans, ducks, grouse, and partridges, as well as possibly exotic taxa, domestic forms (chickens and pigeons) and other unidentifiable birds were the subject of artistic inspiration.

The microstructure of random polycrystalline In2Oy with a bixbyite structure was converted to the amorphous phase of In2(1-x)Ga2xOy film under thermal annealing at 400 °C when the fraction of Ga is ≥29 at. %. In contrast, the enhancement in the orientation of the (222) face and subsequent grain size was observed for the In1.60Ga0.40Oy film with the intermediate Ga fraction of 20 at. %.

This evidence is complicated by the uncertain impact of overexpressing mutant APP, rather than Aβ alone, and for potential interactions between tau and overexpressed APP. Cortical iron elevation is also implicated in AD, and tau promotes iron export by trafficking APP to the neuronal surface. Here, we utilized an alternative model of Aβ toxicity by directly injecting Aβ oligomers into the hippocampus of young and old wild-type and tau knockout mice. We found that ablation of tau protected against Aβ-induced cognitive impairment, hippocampal neuron loss, and iron accumulation. Despite injected human Aβ being eliminated after 5 weeks, enduring changes, including increased APP levels, tau reduction, tau phosphorylation, and iron accumulation, were observed. While the results from our study support the amyloid cascade hypothesis, they also suggest that downstream effectors of Aβ, which propagate toxicity after Aβ has been cleared, may be tractable therapeutic targets.",Aging; Alzheimer’s disease; Iron; Neuroprotection; Tau; β-Amyloid.

546,Plug-and-Play Regularization Using Linear Solvers,"Nair, Pravin; Chaudhury, Kunal N.","There has been tremendous research on the design of image regularizers over the years, from simple Tikhonov and Laplacian to sophisticated sparsity and CNN-based regularizers. Coupled with a model-based loss function, these are typically used for image reconstruction within an optimization framework. The technical challenge is to develop a regularizer that can accurately model realistic images and be optimized efficiently along with the loss function. Motivated by the recent plug-and-play paradigm for image regularization, we construct a quadratic regularizer whose reconstruction capability is competitive with state-of-the-art regularizers. The novelty of the regularizer is that, unlike classical regularizers, the quadratic objective function is derived from the observed data. Since the regularizer is quadratic, we can reduce the optimization to solving a linear system for applications such as superresolution, deblurring, inpainting, etc. In particular, we show that using iterative Krylov solvers, we can converge to the solution in few iterations, where each iteration requires an application of the forward operator and a linear denoiser. The surprising finding is that we can get close to deep learning methods in terms of reconstruction quality. To the best of our knowledge, the possibility of achieving near state-of-the-art performance using a linear solver is novel.",Kernel; Image reconstruction; Convergence; Superresolution; Signal processing algorithms; Optimization; Linear systems; Image reconstruction; regularization; Gaussian denoiser; plug-and-play method; Krylov solver

We first compose a large number of pairs of images, extract their features, and compute their preference labels as training labels. We then obtain a pairwise preference model by training a binary classifier using the features and labels. Because image quality is affected by the masking effect, we propose extracting frequency-aware quality features by adapting state-of-the-art IQA metrics. The learned pairwise preference model is then used to predict the preference between pairs of images in the testing dataset. The quality of each image is computed as the number of preferences.

Migration constitutes one of the most effective processes for surviving and thriving, although the speed at which tree species migrate as a function of climate change is unknown. One way to predict latitudinal movement of trees under the climate of the twenty-first century is to examine past migration since the Last Glacial Maximum. In this study, radiocarbon-dated macrofossils were used to calculate the velocity of past migration of jack pine (Pinus banksiana) and black spruce (Picea mariana), two important fire-adapted conifers of the North American boreal forest. Jack pine migrated at a mean rate of 19 km per century (km-cent) from unglaciated sites in the central and southeastern United States to the northern limit of the species in subarctic Canada. However, the velocity increased between unglaciated and early deglaciated sites in southern Quebec and slowed from early to mid-Holocene in central and eastern Quebec. Migration was at its lowest speed in late-Holocene times, when it stopped about 3,000 y ago. Compared with jack pine, black spruce migrated at a faster mean rate of 25 km-cent from the ice border at the last interstadial (Bølling/Allerød) to the species tree limit. The modern range of both species was nearly occupied about 6,000 y ago. The factors modulating the changing velocity of jack pine migration were closely associated with the warm-dry climate of the late Pleistocene-Holocene transition and the more humid climate of the mid- and late-Holocene.",climate change; deglaciation; fire regime; macrofossil; tree migration.

Deep neural networks excel at this task, as they can be trained end-to-end to accurately classify multiple object categories in an image at pixel level. However, a good tradeoff between high quality and computational resources is yet not present in the state-of-the-art semantic segmentation approaches, limiting their application in real vehicles. In this paper, we propose a deep architecture that is able to run in real time while providing accurate semantic segmentation. The core of our architecture is a novel layer that uses residual connections and factorized convolutions in order to remain efficient while retaining remarkable accuracy. Our approach is able to run at over 83 FPS in a single Titan X, and 7 FPS in a Jetson TX1 (embedded device). A comprehensive set of experiments on the publicly available Cityscapes data set demonstrates that our system achieves an accuracy that is similar to the state of the art, while being orders of magnitude faster to compute than other architectures that achieve top precision. The resulting tradeoff makes our model an ideal approach for scene understanding in IV applications.

556,3-D Active Contour Segmentation Based on Sparse Linear Combination of Training Shapes (SCoTS),"Farhangi, M. Mehdi; Frigui, Hichem; Seow, Albert; Amini, Amir A.","SCoTS captures a sparse representation of shapes in an input image through a linear span of previously delineated shapes in a training repository. The model updates shape prior over level set iterations and captures variabilities in shapes by a sparse combination of the training data. The level set evolution is therefore driven by a data term as well as a term capturing valid prior shapes. During evolution, the shape prior influence is adjusted based on shape reconstruction, with the assigned weight determined from the degree of sparsity of the representation. For the problem of lung nodule segmentation in X-ray CT, SCoTS offers a unified framework, capable of segmenting nodules of all types. Experimental validations are demonstrated on 542 3-D lung nodule images from the LIDC-IDRI database. Despite its generality, SCoTS is competitive with domain specific state of the art methods for lung nodule segmentation.",Adaptive shape prior; dictionary learning; level set segmentation; lung nodules; sparse representation; X-ray CT
557,A new joint CTC-attention-based speech recognition model with multi-level multi-head attention,"Qin, Chu-Xiong; Zhang, Wen-Lin; Qu, Dan","A method called joint connectionist temporal classification (CTC)-attention-based speech recognition has recently received increasing focus and has achieved impressive performance. A hybrid end-to-end architecture that adds an extra CTC loss to the attention-based model could force extra restrictions on alignments. To explore better the end-to-end models, we propose improvements to the feature extraction and attention mechanism. First, we introduce a joint model trained with nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF)-based high-level features. Then, we put forward a hybrid attention mechanism by incorporating multi-head attentions and calculating attention scores over multi-level outputs. Experiments on TIMIT indicate that the new method achieves state-of-the-art performance with our best model. Experiments on WSJ show that our method exhibits a word error rate (WER) that is only 0.2% worse in absolute value than the best referenced method, which is trained on a much larger dataset, and it beats all present end-to-end methods. Further experiments on LibriSpeech show that our method is also comparable to the state-of-the-art end-to-end system in WER.",Speech recognition; End-to-end; Attention mechanism
558,Electrical Load Prediction Using Interval Type-2 Atanassov Intuitionist Fuzzy System: Gravitational Search Algorithm Tuning Approach,"Khanesar, Mojtaba Ahmadieh; Lu, Jingyi; Smith, Thomas; Branson, David","Establishing accurate electrical load prediction is vital for pricing and power system management. However, the unpredictable behavior of private and industrial users results in uncertainty in these power systems. Furthermore, the utilization of renewable energy sources, which are often variable in their production rates, also increases the complexity making predictions even more difficult. In this paper an interval type-2 intuitionist fuzzy logic system whose parameters are trained in a hybrid fashion using gravitational search algorithms with the ridge least square algorithm is presented for short-term prediction of electrical loading. Simulation results are provided to compare the performance of the proposed approach with that of state-of-the-art electrical load prediction algorithms for Poland, and five regions of Australia. The simulation results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed approach over seven different current state-of-the-art prediction algorithms in the literature, namely: SVR, ANN, ELM, EEMD-ELM-GOA, EEMD-ELM-DA, EEMD-ELM-PSO and EEMD-ELM-GWO.",electrical load prediction; interval type-2 Atanassov intuitionist fuzzy logic system; ridge least square algorithm; gravitational search algorithm

Exhaust toxicity of unblended biodiesels changes depending on feedstock type, however the effect of feedstock on blended fuels is less well known. The aim of this study was to assess the impact of biodiesel feedstock on exhaust toxicity of 20% blended biodiesel fuels (B20). Primary human airway epithelial cells were exposed to exhaust diluted 1/15 with air from an engine running on conventional ultra-low sulfur diesel (ULSD) or 20% blends of soy, canola, waste cooking oil (WCO), tallow, palm or cottonseed biodiesel in diesel. Physico-chemical exhaust properties were compared between fuels and the post-exposure effect of exhaust on cellular viability and media release was assessed 24 h later. Exhaust properties changed significantly between all fuels with cottonseed B20 being the most different to both ULSD and its respective unblended biodiesel. Exposure to palm B20 resulted in significantly decreased cellular viability (96.3 ± 1.7%; p < 0.01) whereas exposure to soy B20 generated the greatest number of changes in mediator release (including IL-6, IL-8 and TNF-α, p < 0.05) when compared to air exposed controls, with palm B20 and tallow B20 closely following. In contrast, canola B20 and WCO B20 were the least toxic with only mediators G-CSF and TNF-α being significantly increased. Therefore, exposure to palm B20, soy B20 and tallow B20 were found to be the most toxic and exposure to canola B20 and WCO B20 the least. The top three most toxic and the bottom three least toxic B20 fuels are consistent with their unblended counterparts, suggesting that feedstock type greatly impacts exhaust toxicity, even when biodiesel only comprises 20% of the fuel.",Exhaust exposure; Health; In vitro exposure model; Toxicology of exhaust emissions; Vehicle emissions.

The functional half-life for this transition at physiologic temperature and pH is ∼1 to 2 h. To better understand the molecular mechanisms underlying this transition, we now report on the analysis of a comprehensive PAI-1 variant library expressed on filamentous phage and selected for functional stability after 48 h at 37 °C. Of the 7201 possible single amino acid substitutions in PAI-1, we identified 439 that increased the functional stability of PAI-1 beyond that of the WT protein. We also found 1549 single amino acid substitutions that retained inhibitory activity toward the canonical target protease of PAI-1 (urokinase-like plasminogen activator), whereas exhibiting functional stability less than or equal to that of WT PAI-1. Missense mutations that increase PAI-1 functional stability are concentrated in highly flexible regions within the PAI-1 structure. Finally, we developed a method for simultaneously measuring the functional half-lives of hundreds of PAI-1 variants in a multiplexed, massively parallel manner, quantifying the functional half-lives for 697 single missense variants of PAI-1 by this approach. Overall, these findings provide novel insight into the mechanisms underlying the latency transition of PAI-1 and provide a database for interpreting human PAI-1 genetic variants.",enzyme inhibitor; fibrinolysis; high-throughput sequencing; kinetics; phage display; protease inhibitor; serpin.
561,The Changing Role of ENGOs in Water Governance: Institutional Entrepreneurs?,"Seanna L Davidson,Rob C de Loë,Seanna L Davidson,Rob C de Loë","The changing role of the state in the last quarter century has been an important contemporary concern for policy makers, scholars, and the public. Equally, there is increasing recognition among governance scholars that nongovernment actors are exerting new kinds of influence over governance systems and contributing in novel ways to governance processes. The role of environmental nongovernmental organizations (ENGOs) is particularly pertinent given the continued involvement of ENGOs within collaborative, adaptive, and co-management governance, across several contexts and regions. This paper uses an analytical framework derived from recent studies on institutional entrepreneurs, to examine the skills ENGOs are applying in order to orchestrate change. An empirical case of governance for water in Canada's Lake Simcoe region provides the foundation for the research. Drawing on a mixed methods approach, the research finds that ENGOs in Lake Simcoe have taken on a role as an institutional entrepreneur, and thereby have altered the relationship between governance actors in this setting. A key outcome of their actions is a more dominant, engaged, and influential role for ENGOs in a critical, regional governance system.",Canada; Environmental nongovernment organizations; Institutional entrepreneurs; Lake Simcoe; Ontario; Water governance.
562,Inter-domain routing for communication networks using Hierarchical Hopfield Neural Networks,"Silva, Hitalo O.; Bastos-Filho, Carmelo J. A.","This paper presents the Hierarchical Hopfield Neural Networks (HHNN). HHNN is a novel Hopfield Neural Network (HNN) approach. HHNN is composed of a hierarchy of self-sufficient HNNs, aiming to reduce the neural network structure and mitigate convergence problems. The HNNN composition depends on the applied problem. In this paper, the problem approached is the inter-domain routing for communication networks. Thus, the hierarchy of HNNs mimics the structure of communication networks (domains, nodes, and links). The proof of concept and the comparison between HNNN with the state-of-art HNN occurs using an implementation of them in the Java programming language. Besides, the performance analysis of the HHNN runs on a parallel hardware platform, using VHDL to develop it. The results have demonstrated a reduction of 93.75% and 99.98% in the number of neurons and connections to build the neural network, respectively. Furthermore, the mean time to achieve convergence of HHNN is rough 1.52% of the total time needed by the current state-of-art HNN approach. It is also less susceptible to early convergence problems when used in communications networks with a large number of nodes. Last, but not least, the VHDL implementation shows that convergence time of HHNN is comparable to routing algorithms used in practical applications.",Hopfield Neural Networks; Routing algorithms; Communication networks; Artificial neural networks

For the purposes of surgical planning, we design the first automatic approach to detect and segment the intrauterine cavity from axial, sagittal and coronal MRI stacks. Our methodology relies on the ability of capsule networks to successfully capture the part-whole interdependency of objects in the scene, particularly for unique class instances (i.e., intrauterine cavity). The presented deep Q-CapsNet reinforcement learning framework is built upon a context-adaptive detection policy to generate a bounding box of the womb. A capsule architecture is subsequently designed to segment (or refine) the whole intrauterine cavity. This network is coupled with a strided nnU-Net feature extractor, which encodes discriminative feature maps to construct strong primary capsules. The method is robustly evaluated with and without the localization stage using 13 performance measures, and directly compared with 15 state-of-the-art deep neural networks trained on 71 singleton and monochorionic twin pregnancies. An average Dice score above 0.91 is achieved for all ablations, revealing the potential of our approach to be used in clinical practice.",Cavity resonators; Magnetic resonance imaging; Feature extraction; Image segmentation; Motion segmentation; Forestry; Lung; Fetal surgery; twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome; MRI; intrauterine cavity segmentation; capsules; q-learning

The objective of this study is primarily to assess the polar pesticide contamination (mainly herbicides) of the Niger River and its tributary, the Mekrou River, in Niger, using both grab sampling and POCIS (Polar Organic Chemical Integrative Samplers), and then to evaluate the risk to the aquatic environment. Two water sampling campaigns were carried out during the wet and dry seasons. The polar pesticides were analyzed by liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry, which allowed the identification of compounds with concentrations in the grab samples above the WHO guide values and the EU directive: diuron with 2221 ng/L (EU quality guideline: 200 ng/L), atrazine with 742 ng/L (EU quality guideline: 600 ng/L) and acetochlor with 238 ng/L (EU quality guideline: 100 ng/L). The risk assessment study indicated that diuron and atrazine present a high risk for the aquatic environment during the wet season. The main source of water contamination is the intensive use of pesticides in urban agriculture near the city of Niamey, and the intensive cotton farming in the Benin. Moreover, the surveys (30 producers interviewed) showed that 70% of the pesticides used are not approved by the Interstate Committee for Drought Control in the Sahel (CILSS) and some are prohibited in Niger. The inventory of pesticides sold in the zone showed that active ingredients used by producers are 48% insecticides, 45% herbicides, and 7% fungicides.",Agriculture; Mekrou River; Niger River Valley; POCIS; Pesticides; Risk assessment.

In an aqueous environment, light-induced acoustic waves form cavitation bubbles by altering the localized pressure to trigger the phase transition of liquid water into vapor. In this study, we report photoacoustic dissociation of beta-amyloid (Aβ) aggregates, a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease, by metal-organic framework-derived carbon (MOFC). MOFC exhibits a near-infrared (NIR) light-responsive photoacoustic characteristic that possesses defect-rich and entangled graphitic layers that generate intense cavitation bubbles by absorbing tissue-penetrable NIR light. According to our video analysis, the photoacoustic cavitation by MOFC occurs within milliseconds in the water, which was controllable by NIR light dose. The photoacoustic cavitation successfully transforms robust, β-sheet-dominant neurotoxic Aβ aggregates into nontoxic debris by changing the asymmetric distribution of water molecules around the Aβ's amino acid residues. This work unveils the therapeutic potential of NIR-triggered photoacoustic cavitation as a modulator of the Aβ aggregate structure.",amyloid; carbon nanoparticles; metal−organic framework; near-infrared light; photoacoustic.

The proposed methodology improves the state-of-the-art by accounting for splitter delays and creating a fully balanced clock tree structure in which the number of clock splitters from the clock source to all the sink nodes is identical. Additionally, a mixed integer linear programming based algorithm is presented that removes the overlaps among the clock splitters and placed cells (i.e., placement blockages) and minimizes the clock skew, simultaneously. Using the proposed method, the average clock skew for 17 benchmark circuits is 4.6 ps, improving the state-of-the-art algorithm by 70%. Finally, a clock tree synthesis algorithm for imbalanced topologies is presented that reduces the clock skew and the number of clock splitters in the clock network by 56% and 37%, respectively, compared with a fully balanced clock tree solution.",Clock tree synthesis; legalization; physical design; placement; single flux quantum (SFQ); superconducting electronics

To determine whether expression of proposed Biocathode-MCL extracellular electron transfer proteins are changed by modulating electrode potential without disrupting the relative distribution of microbial constituents, metaproteomic and 16S rRNA gene expression analyses were performed after switching from an optimal to suboptimal potential based on an expected decrease in electrode respiration. Five hundred and seventy-nine unique proteins were identified across both potentials, the majority of which were assigned to three previously defined Biocathode-MCL metagenomic clusters: a Marinobacter sp., a member of the family Chromatiaceae, and a Labrenzia sp (abbreviated as MCL). Statistical analysis of spectral counts using the Fisher's exact test identified 16 proteins associated with the optimal potential, five of which are predicted electron transfer proteins. The majority of proteins associated with the suboptimal potential were involved in protein turnover/synthesis, motility, and membrane transport. Unipept and 16S rRNA gene expression analyses indicated that the taxonomic profile of the microbiome did not change after 52 h at the suboptimal potential. These findings show that protein expression is sensitive to the electrode potential without inducing shifts in community composition, a feature that may be exploited for engineering Biocathode-MCL.

569,Global-Local Transformer for Brain Age Estimation,"He, Sheng; Grant, P. Ellen; Ou, Yangming","Deep learning can provide rapid brain age estimation based on brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). However, most studies use one neural network to extract the global information from the whole input image, ignoring the local fine-grained details. In this paper, we propose a global-local transformer, which consists of a global-pathway to extract the global-context information from the whole input image and a local-pathway to extract the local fine-grained details from local patches. The fine-grained information from the local patches are fused with the global-context information by the attention mechanism, inspired by the transformer, to estimate the brain age. We evaluate the proposed method on 8 public datasets with 8,379 healthy brain MRIs with the age range of 0-97 years. 6 datasets are used for cross-validation and 2 datasets are used for evaluating the generality. Comparing with other state-of-the-art methods, the proposed global-local transformer reduces the mean absolute error of the estimated ages to 2.70 years and increases the correlation coefficient of the estimated age and the chronological age to 0.9853. In addition, our proposed method provides regional information of which local patches are most informative for brain age estimation.

571,Deblurring Low-Light Images with Light Streaks,"Hu, Zhe; Cho, Sunghyun; Wang, Jue; Yang, Ming-Hsuan","Images acquired in low-light conditions with handheld cameras are often blurry, so steady poses and long exposure time are required to alleviate this problem. Although significant advances have been made in image deblurring, state-of-the-art approaches often fail on low-light images, as a sufficient number of salient features cannot be extracted for blur kernel estimation. On the other hand, light streaks are common phenomena in low-light images that have not been extensively explored in existing approaches. In this work, we propose an algorithm that utilizes light streaks to facilitate deblurring low-light images. The light streaks, which commonly exist in the low-light blurry images, contain rich information regarding camera motion and blur kernels. A method is developed in this work to detect light streaks for kernel estimation. We introduce a non-linear blur model that explicitly takes light streaks and corresponding light sources into account, and pose them as constraints for estimating the blur kernel in an optimization framework. For practical applications, the proposed algorithm is extended to handle images undergoing non-uniform blur. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm performs favorably against the state-of-the-art methods on deblurring real-world low-light images.",Image deblurring; light streak; non-uniform blur

PROMIS measures were completed by parents of autistic children and adolescents ages 5-17 years as part of two studies (n = 939 parents in the first study and n = 406 parents in the second study). Data from the first study were used to develop autism-specific percentiles for PROMIS parent-proxy sleep disturbance, sleep-related impairment, fatigue, and anxiety. Previously established United States general population percentiles were applied to interpret PROMIS scores in both studies. Results of logistic regression models showed that parent-reported material hardship was associated with scoring in the moderate-severe range (defined as ≥75th percentile in the general population) on all four PROMIS measures (odds ratios 1.7-2.2). In the second study, the percentage of children with severe scores (defined as ≥95th percentile in the general population) was 30% for anxiety, 25% for sleep disturbance, and 17% for sleep-related impairment, indicating a high burden of these problems among autistic children. Few children had scores at or above the autism-specific 95th percentile on these measures (3%-4%), indicating that their scores were similar to other autistic children.

Both strains had two copies of the 16S rRNA genes rrn1 and rrn2, showing 2.6 and 3.9% divergence, respectively. The rrn1 gene of PSR5T showed 98.4 and 95.3% similarity to the rrn1 and rrn2 genes of strain PSR8T; the rrn2 gene of PSR5T displayed 97.4 and 96.7% similarity to those of strain PSR8T, respectively. Phylogenetic analyses based on the 16S rRNA and rpoB' genes revealed that strains PSR5T and PSR8T formed a single cluster, and then tightly clustered with the current four Haladaptatus species (93.5-97.1% similarities for the 16S rRNA gene and 89.3-90.9% similarities for the rpoB' gene, respectively). Several phenotypic characteristics differentiate strains PSR5T and PSR8T from current Haladaptatus members. The polar lipids of the two strains are phosphatidic acid, phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol phosphate methyl ester phosphatidylglycerol sulphate and three glycolipids. One of the glycolipids is sulphated mannosyl glucosyl diether, and the remaining two glycolipids are unidentified.

On the other hand, galanin is highly expressed in the hypothalamus and has been reported to be involved in feeding regulation. In this study, we investigated the involvement of the VMH-PACAP to the dorsomedial hypothalamus (DMH)-galanin signaling in the regulation of feeding. Galanin expression in the hypothalamus was significantly increased with fasting, but this increment was canceled in PACAP-knockout (KO) mice. Furthermore, overexpression of PACAP in the VMH increased the expression of galanin, while knockdown (KD) of PACAP in the VMH decreased the expression of galanin, indicating that the expression of galanin in the hypothalamus might be regulated by PACAP in the VMH. Therefore, we expressed the synaptophysin-EGFP fusion protein (SypEGFP) in PACAP neurons in the VMH and visualized the neural projection to the hypothalamic region where galanin was highly expressed. A strong synaptophysin-EGFP signal was observed in the DMH, indicating that PACAP-expressing cells of the VMH projected to the DMH. Furthermore, galanin immunostaining in the DMH showed that galanin expression was weak in PACAP-KO mice. When galanin in the DMH was knocked down, food intake during the dark cycle and after fasting was decreased, and food intake during the light cycle was increased, as in PACAP-KO mice. These results indicated that galanin in the DMH may regulate the feeding downstream of PACAP in the VMH.",Appetite; DMH; Galanin; Hypothalamus; PACAP; VMH.

578,Edge-Preserving PET Image Reconstruction Using Trust Optimization Transfer,"Wang, Guobao; Qi, Jinyi","Iterative image reconstruction for positron emission tomography can improve image quality by using spatial regularization. The most commonly used quadratic penalty often oversmoothes sharp edges and fine features in reconstructed images, while nonquadratic penalties can preserve edges and achieve higher contrast recovery. Existing optimization algorithms such as the expectation maximization (EM) and preconditioned conjugate gradient (PCG) algorithms work well for the quadratic penalty, but are less efficient for high-curvature or nonsmooth edge-preserving regularizations. This paper proposes a new algorithm to accelerate edge-preserving image reconstruction by using two strategies: trust surrogate and optimization transfer descent. Trust surrogate approximates the original penalty by a smoother function at each iteration, but guarantees the algorithm to descend monotonically; Optimization transfer descent accelerates a conventional optimization transfer algorithm by using conjugate gradient and line search. Results of computer simulations and real 3-D data show that the proposed algorithm converges much faster than the conventional EM and PCG for smooth edge-preserving regularization and can also be more efficient than the current state-of-art algorithms for the nonsmooth l(1) regularization.",Edge-preserving regularization; image reconstruction; optimization algorithm; optimization transfer; positron emission tomography (PET)

Arts and cultural programs were reported to enhance their quality of life. The Le Louvre a l'hopital study presents a new approach in which the museum moves to the hospital by displaying and discussing artworks with patients interactively. Over one year, four large statues were disposed in the hospital gardens, 30 reprints of large painting were exhibited in the hospital hall, dining rooms, and circulations areas. A total of 83 small-group guided art discussions (90 min) were organized, which 451 patients attended. The 200 small-size reproductions of paintings placed in the patients' rooms were chosen based on their individual preferences. Decreased anxiety after the art sessions was reported by 160 of 201 patients (79.6%). Out of 451 patients, 406 (90%) said the art program had met their expectations, and 372 (82.4%) wished to continue the experience with caregivers (162 paramedics trained for art activity during 66 workshops). In conclusion, moving the museum to the hospital constitutes a valuable way to provide art activities for inpatients in large numbers, which may reduce hospital-related anxiety in many instances.",art therapy; museum; hospital-related stress
580,"Investigating Generalized Performance of Data-Constrained Supervised Machine Learning Models on Novel, Related Samples in Intrusion Detection","D'hooge, Laurens; Verkerken, Miel; Wauters, Tim; De Turck, Filip; Volckaert, Bruno","Recently proposed methods in intrusion detection are iterating on machine learning methods as a potential solution. These novel methods are validated on one or more datasets from a sparse collection of academic intrusion detection datasets. Their recognition as improvements to the state-of-the-art is largely dependent on whether they can demonstrate a reliable increase in classification metrics compared to similar works validated on the same datasets. Whether these increases are meaningful outside of the training/testing datasets is rarely asked and never investigated. This work aims to demonstrate that strong general performance does not typically follow from strong classification on the current intrusion detection datasets. Binary classification models from a range of algorithmic families are trained on the attack classes of CSE-CIC-IDS2018, a state-of-the-art intrusion detection dataset. After establishing baselines for each class at various points of data access, the same trained models are tasked with classifying samples from the corresponding attack classes in CIC-IDS2017, CIC-DoS2017 and CIC-DDoS2019. Contrary to what the baseline results would suggest, the models have rarely learned a generally applicable representation of their attack class. Stability and predictability of generalized model performance are central issues for all methods on all attack classes. Focusing only on the three best-in-class models in terms of interdataset generalization, reveals that for network-centric attack classes (brute force, denial of service and distributed denial of service), general representations can be learned with flat losses in classification performance (precision and recall) below 5%. Other attack classes vary in generalized performance from stark losses in recall (-35%) with intact precision (98+%) for botnets to total degradation of precision and moderate recall loss for Web attack and infiltration models. The core conclusion of this article is a warning to researchers in the field. Expecting results of proposed methods on the test sets of state-of-the-art intrusion detection datasets to translate to generalized performance is likely a serious overestimation. Four proposals to reduce this overestimation are set out as future work directions.",CIC-IDS2017; CSE-CIC-IDS2018; CIC-DoS2017; CIC-DDoS2019; cybersecurity; generalization; intrusion detection; network security; network traffic classification; supervised machine learning

582,Cross-Modality Contrastive Learning for Hyperspectral Image Classification,"Hang, Renlong; Qian, Xuwei; Liu, Qingshan","Deep learning has attracted much attention in the field of hyperspectral image classification recently, due to its powerful representation and generalization abilities. Most of the current deep learning models are trained in a supervised manner, which requires large amounts of labeled samples to achieve the state-of-the-art performance. Unfortunately, pixel-level labeling in hyperspectral imageries is difficult, time-consuming, and human-dependent. To address this issue, we propose an unsupervised feature learning model using multimodal data, hyperspectral, and light detection and ranging (LiDAR) in particular. It takes advantage of the relationship between hyperspectral and LiDAR data to extract features, without using any label information. After that, we design a dual fine-tuning strategy to transfer the extracted features for hyperspectral image classification with small numbers of training samples. Such a strategy is able to explore not only the semantic information but also the intrinsic structure information of training samples. In order to test the performance of our proposed model, we conduct comprehensive experiments on three hyperspectral and LiDAR datasets. Experimental results show that our proposed model can achieve better performance than several state-of-the-art deep learning models.",Hyperspectral imaging; Feature extraction; Training; Laser radar; Representation learning; Principal component analysis; Data models; Fine-tuning strategy; hyperspectral image classification; multimodal data; unsupervised deep learning
583,Mechanism of piR-1245/PIWI-like protein-2 regulating Janus kinase-2/signal transducer and activator of transcription-3/vascular endothelial growth factor signaling pathway in retinal neovascularization,"Yong Yu,Li-Kun Xia,Yu Di,Qing-Zhu Nie,Xiao-Long Chen,Yong Yu,Li-Kun Xia,Yu Di,Qing-Zhu Nie,Xiao-Long Chen","Inhibiting retinal neovascularization is the optimal strategy for the treatment of retina-related diseases, but there is currently no effective treatment for retinal neovascularization. P-element-induced wimpy testis (PIWI)-interacting RNA (piRNA) is a type of small non-coding RNA implicated in a variety of diseases. In this study, we found that the expression of piR-1245 and the interacting protein PIWIL2 were remarkably increased in human retinal endothelial cells cultured in a hypoxic environment, and cell apoptosis, migration, tube formation and proliferation were remarkably enhanced in these cells. Knocking down piR-1245 inhibited the above phenomena. After intervention by a p-JAK2 activator, piR-1245 decreased the expression of hypoxia inducible factor-1α and vascular endothelial growth factor through the JAK2/STAT3 pathway. For in vivo analysis, 7-day-old newborn mice were raised in 75 ± 2% hyperoxia for 5 days and then piR-1245 in the retina was knocked down. In these mice, the number of newly formed vessels in the retina was decreased, the expressions of inflammation-related proteins were reduced, the number of apoptotic cells in the retina was decreased, the JAK2/STAT3 pathway was inhibited, and the expressions of hypoxia inducible factor-1α and vascular endothelial growth factor were decreased. Injection of the JAK2 inhibitor JAK2/TYK2-IN-1 into the vitreous cavity inhibited retinal neovascularization in mice and reduced expression of hypoxia inducible factor-1α and vascular endothelial growth factor. These findings suggest that piR-1245 activates the JAK2/STAT3 pathway, regulates the expression of hypoxia inducible factor-1α and vascular endothelial growth factor, and promotes retinal neovascularization. Therefore, piR-1245 may be a new therapeutic target for retinal neovascularization.",PIWI-interacting RNA; angiogenesis; human retinal endothelial cells; hypoxia; hypoxia inducible factor-1α; interleukin-1β; migration; non-coding RNA; oxygen-induced injury; retinopathy.

Such an approach to the system description enables simulation investigations of the DADR system as an element of dynamic stability improvement of an electrical energy distribution network.

585,Dynamic Orthogonal Projection Constrained Discriminative Tracking,"Yu, Bin; Tang, Ming; Zhu, Guibo; Wang, Jinqiao; Lu, Hanqing","Due to the end-to-end feature learning with convolutional neural networks (CNNs), modern discriminative trackers improve the state of the art significantly. To achieve a strong discrimination, the learned features are usually high-dimensional, resulting in a massive number of parameters contained in the discriminative model and the increase of risk of over-fitting in the online tracking. In this letter, we try to alleviate the risk of over-fitting by means of the adaptive dimensionality reduction (DR) through CNNs. Specifically, an orthogonality constrained ridge regression model is proposed to reduce the dimensionality of features, and a dynamic sub-network (DOPNet) is designed to learn to perform DR. After trained with an orthogonality loss and a regression one, DOPNet generates a set of orthogonal bases (i. e., weights in FC layers) dynamically to reduce the feature dimensionality for a discriminative model in the online tracking. Based on the novel discriminative model and DOPNet, an effective and efficient tracker, DOPTracker, is developed. DOPTracker achieves the state-of-the-art results on four benchmarks, OTB-2015, VOT-2018, NfS, and GOT-10 k while running at 30 FPS.",Biological system modeling; Training; Feature extraction; Dimensionality reduction; Optimization; Adaptation models; Visualization; Visual tracking; dimensionality reduction; discriminative model

The involvement of specific lipids in LC3/GABARAP function is poorly understood. Exploring the interaction of LC3/GABARAP proteins with phosphatidylcholine- or sphingomyelin-based bilayers has revealed that cardiolipin is essential for the protein-bilayer interaction, and that ceramide markedly increases binding. Giant unilamellar vesicles examined under confocal fluorescence microscopy reveal that ceramide segregates laterally into very rigid domains, while GABARAP binds only the more fluid regions, suggesting that the enhancing role of ceramide is exerted by the minority of ceramide molecules dispersed in the fluid phase.Abbreviations: Atg8: autophagy-related 8; Cer: ceramide; CL: cardiolipin; eCer: egg ceramide; GABARAP: gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor associated protein; GUV: giant unilamellar vesicle; MAP1LC3/LC3: microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3; Rho-PE: lissamine rhodamine phosphatidylethanolamine; SM: sphingomyelin.",Autophagy proteins; LC3/GABARAP; cardiolipin; ceramide; mitochondria.

However, recent research suggests that trauma subtypes, rather than cumulative trauma, may better predict psychological outcomes. This study investigated the predictive utility of trauma subtypes in the assessment of refugee mental health. Multiple regression was used to determine whether cumulative trauma or trauma subtypes explained more variance in depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptom scores in 70 Syrian and Iraqi refugees. Subtype models performed better than cumulative trauma models for PTSD (cumulative R2 = 0.138; subtype R2 = 0.32), anxiety (cumulative R2 = 0.061; subtype R2 = 0.246), and depression (cumulative R2 = 0.041; subtype R2 = 0.184). Victimization was the only subtype significantly associated with PTSD (p < 0.001; r2 = 0.210), anxiety (p < 0.001; r2 = 0.162), and depression (p = 0.002; r2 = 0.140).

588,Comparing State-of-the-Art and Emerging Augmented Reality Interfaces for Autonomous Vehicle-to-Pedestrian Communication,"Prattico, F. Gabriele; Lamberti, Fabrizio; Cannavo, Alberto; Morra, Lia; Montuschi, Paolo","Providing pedestrians and other vulnerable road users with a clear indication about a fully autonomous vehicle status and intentions is crucial to make them coexist. In the last few years, a variety of external interfaces have been proposed, leveraging different paradigms and technologies including vehicle-mounted devices (like LED panels), short-range on-road projections, and road infrastructure interfaces (e.g., special asphalts with embedded displays). These designs were experimented in different settings, using mockups, specially prepared vehicles, or virtual environments, with heterogeneous evaluation metrics. Promising interfaces based on Augmented Reality (AR) have been proposed too, but their usability and effectiveness have not been tested yet. This paper aims to complement such body of literature by presenting a comparison of state-of-the-art interfaces and new designs under common conditions. To this aim, an immersive Virtual Reality-based simulation was developed, recreating a well-known scenario represented by pedestrians crossing in urban environments under non-regulated conditions. A user study was then performed to investigate the various dimensions of vehicle-to-pedestrian interaction leveraging objective and subjective metrics. Even though no interface clearly stood out over all the considered dimensions, one of the AR designs achieved state-of-the-art results in terms of safety and trust, at the cost of higher cognitive effort and lower intuitiveness compared to LED panels showing anthropomorphic features. Together with rankings on the various dimensions, indications about advantages and drawbacks of the various alternatives that emerged from this study could provide important information for next developments in the field.",Roads; Light emitting diodes; Strips; Color; Visualization; Autonomous vehicles; Augmented reality; Fully autonomous vehicles; human-machine interaction; virtual reality; augmented reality; vehicle-to-pedestrian communication; pedestrian crossing

Smith) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) (fall armyworm) is an extremely destructive insect pest that causes crop losses, especially cereal production across the world. Its management is challenged by its high migratory ability, polyphagous nature, high fecundity level, and short life cycle. It has become a serious threat across the globe that requires proactive and coordinated regional and global interventions. Although synthetic insecticides have been widely utilized to control the pest, there are numerous inherent challenges associated with the overreliance and overuse of these chemicals, e.g., toxicity to humans, destruction of natural pest enemies and pollinators, environmental and food contamination, pest resurgence, secondary pest outbreaks, and resistance development. Plant-derived pesticides such as Azadirachta indica, Eucalyptus globulus, Jatropha curcas, Lantana camara, Phytolacca dodecandra, and Piper guineense have been evaluated under laboratory, greenhouse, and field conditions to control S. frugiperda. We are certain that the substantial potential of these plants under field conditions could be enhanced and promoted together with existing plant-based products (registered) for use against S. frugiperda as an alternative in integrated pest management schemes. Therefore, this review highlights challenges and prospects that will help refocus and increase research attention on the development and application of botanical pesticides under field conditions rather than only under laboratory and control conditions to increase the commercialization and adoption rate of this technology across the globe.",Spodoptera frugiperda; adoption; botanical pesticide; challenge and prospect; commercialization.

Nasopharyngeal microbial community structure within SARS-CoV-2 infected patients could reveal interesting microbiome dynamics that may influence the disease outcomes. Here, in this research study, we analyzed distinct nasopharyngeal microbiome profile in the deceased (n = 48) and recovered (n = 29) COVID-19 patients and compared it with control SARS-CoV-2 negative individuals (control) (n = 33). The nasal microbiome composition of the three groups varies significantly (PERMANOVA, p-value <0.001), where deceased patients showed higher species richness compared to the recovered and control groups. Pathogenic genera, including Corynebacterium (LDA score 5.51), Staphylococcus, Serratia, Klebsiella and their corresponding species were determined as biomarkers (p-value <0.05, LDA cutoff 4.0) in the deceased COVID-19 patients. Ochrobactrum (LDA score 5.79), and Burkholderia (LDA 5.29), were found in the recovered group which harbors ordinal bacteria (p-value <0.05, LDA-4.0) as biomarkers. Similarly, Pseudomonas (LDA score 6.19), and several healthy nasal cavity commensals including Veillonella, and Porphyromonas, were biomarkers for the control individuals. Healthy commensal bacteria may trigger the immune response and alter the viral infection susceptibility and thus, may play important role and possible recovery that needs to be further explored.

There is a growing recognition that education needs to change in order to address climate change, yet the question remains ""how?"" How does one engage young people with a topic that is perceived as abstract, distant, and complex, and which at the same time is contributing to growing feelings of sadness, hopelessness, and anxiety among them? In this paper, I argue that although the important contributions that the arts and humanities can make to this challenge are widely discussed, they remain an untapped or underutilized potential. I then present a novel framework and demonstrate its use in schools. Findings from a high school in Portugal point to the central place that art can play in climate change education and engagement more general, with avenues for greater depth of learning and transformative potential. The paper provides guidance for involvementin,with, andthroughart and makes suggestions to create links between disciplines to support meaning-making, create new images, and metaphors and bring in a wider solution space for climate change. Going beyond the stereotypes of art as communication and mainstream climate change education, it offers teachers, facilitators, and researchers a wider portfolio for climate change engagement that makes use of the multiple potentials of the arts.",Sustainability education; Transformation; Arts-based methods; Youth

593,Discovering Hidden Topical Hubs and Authorities Across Multiple Online Social Networks,"Lee, Roy Ka-Wei; Tuan-Anh Hoang; Lim, Ee-Peng","Finding influential users in online social networks (OSNs) is an important problem with many possible useful applications. Many methods have been proposed to identify influential users in OSNs. PageRank and HITs are two well known examples that determine influential users through link analysis. In recent years, new models that consider both content and social network links have been developed. The Hub and Authority Topic (HAT) model is one that extends HITS to identify topic-specific hubs and authorities by jointly learning hubs, authorities, and topical interests from users' relationship and textual content. However, many of the previous works are confined to identifying influential users within a single OSN. These models, when applied to multiple OSNs, could not learn influential users under a common set of topics nor address platform preferences. In this paper, we therefore propose the MPHAT model, an extension of HAT, to jointly model the topic-specific hub users, authority users, their topical interests and platform preferences. We evaluate MPHAT against several existing state-of-the-art methods in three tasks: (i) modeling of topics, (ii) platform choice prediction, and (iii) link recommendation. Based on our extensive experiments in multiple OSNs settings using synthetic datasets and real-world datasets from Twitter and Instagram, we show that MPHAT is comparable to state-of-the-art topic models in learning topics but outperforms the state-of-the-art models in platform prediction and link recommendation tasks. We also empirically demonstrate the ability of MPHAT to determine influential users within and across multiple OSNs.",Hub; authority; topic model; online social networks
594,Cells of the Central Nervous System: An Overview of Their Structure and Function,"John W Bigbee,John W Bigbee","The central nervous system is the last major organ system in the vertebrate body to yield its cellular structure, due to the complexity of its cells and their interactions. The fundamental unit of the nervous system is the neuron, which forms complex circuits that receive and integrate information and generate adaptive responses. Each neuron is composed of an input domain consisting of multiple dendrites along with the cell body, which is also responsible for the majority of macromolecule synthesis for the cell. The output domain is the axon which is a singular extension from the cell body that propagates the action potential to the synapse, where signals pass from one neuron to another. Facilitating these functions are cohorts of supporting cells consisting of astrocytes, oligodendrocytes and microglia along with NG2 cells and ependymal cells. Astrocytes have a dazzling array of functions including physical support, maintenance of homeostasis, development and integration of synaptic activity. Oligodendrocytes form the myelin sheath which surrounds axons and enables rapid conduction of the nerve impulse. Microglia are the resident immune cells, providing immune surveillance and remodeling of neuronal circuits during development and trauma. All these cells function in concert with each other, producing the remarkably diverse functions of the nervous system.",Astrocyte; Microglia; Myelin; Neuron; Oligodendrocyte.

This interaction is a keystone for the successful deployment of robots in areas requiring a customized assistance like education and healthcare, or assisting humans in everyday tasks. These unconstrained environments present additional difficulties for face recognition, extreme head pose variability being one of the most challenging. In this paper, we address this issue and make a fourfold contribution. First, it has been designed a tool for gathering an uniform distribution of head pose images from a person, which has been used to collect a new dataset of faces, both presented in this work. Then, the dataset has served as a testbed for analyzing the detrimental effects this problem has on a number of state-of-the-art methods, showing their decreased effectiveness outside a limited range of poses. Finally, we propose an optimization method to mitigate said negative effects by considering key pose samples in the recognition system's set of known faces. The conducted experiments demonstrate that this optimized set of poses significantly improves the performance of a state-of-the-art, cutting-edge system based on Multitask Cascaded Convolutional Neural Networks (MTCNNs) and ArcFace.",face recognition; assistant mobile robots; cross-pose face recognition; MAPIR Faces; human-robot interaction

Nerve injury causes sustained α2δ-1 upregulation in the dorsal root ganglion (DRG), which promotes NMDA receptor synaptic trafficking and activation in the spinal dorsal horn, a hallmark of chronic neuropathic pain. However, little is known about how nerve injury initiates and maintains the high expression level of α2δ-1 to sustain chronic pain. Here, we show that nerve injury caused histone hyperacetylation and diminished enrichment of histone deacetylase-2 (HDAC2), but not HDAC3, at the Cacna2d1 promoter in the DRG. Strikingly, Hdac2 knockdown or conditional knockout in DRG neurons in male and female mice consistently induced long-lasting mechanical pain hypersensitivity, which was readily reversed by blocking NMDA receptors, inhibiting α2δ-1 with gabapentin or disrupting the α2δ-1-NMDA receptor interaction at the spinal cord level. Hdac2 deletion in DRG neurons increased histone acetylation levels at the Cacna2d1 promoter, upregulated α2δ-1 in the DRG, and potentiated α2δ-1-dependent NMDA receptor activity at primary afferent central terminals in the spinal dorsal horn. Correspondingly, Hdac2 knockdown-induced pain hypersensitivity was blunted in Cacna2d1 knockout mice. Thus, our findings reveal that HDAC2 functions as a pivotal transcriptional repressor of neuropathic pain via constitutively suppressing α2δ-1 expression and ensuing presynaptic NMDA receptor activity in the spinal cord. HDAC2 enrichment levels at the Cacna2d1 promoter in DRG neurons constitute a unique epigenetic mechanism that governs acute-to-chronic pain transition.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Excess α2δ-1 proteins produced after nerve injury directly interact with glutamate NMDA receptors to potentiate synaptic NMDA receptor activity in the spinal cord, a prominent mechanism of nerve pain. Because α2δ-1 upregulation after nerve injury is long lasting, gabapentinoids relieve pain symptoms only temporarily. Our study demonstrates for the first time the unexpected role of intrinsic HDAC2 activity at the α2δ-1 gene promoter in limiting α2δ-1 gene transcription, NMDA receptor-dependent synaptic plasticity, and chronic pain development after nerve injury. These findings challenge the prevailing view about the role of general HDAC activity in promoting chronic pain. Restoring the repressive HDAC2 function and/or reducing histone acetylation at the α2δ-1 gene promoter in primary sensory neurons could lead to long-lasting relief of nerve pain.",chromatin; dorsal root ganglion; epigenetics; histone modification; synaptic plasticity; transcriptomics.
598,Art painting detection and identification based on deep learning and image local features,"Hong, Yiyu; Kim, Jongweon","Many art paintings are placed in film scenes or TV programs as decoration. To prevent using unauthorized copyrighted art paintings, we propose a method that combines a deep learning based object detector and hand-crafted image local features to identify copyrighted art paintings from images that contain them. The object detector is trained with our collected data to be able to detect art paintings. If a query image is input, the object detector will detect the art painting regions, then, the copyrighted art paintings can be identified by matching image local features between the art painting regions and the original copyrighted art paintings that have already been stored in advance. To test the ability of the proposed method from different aspects, we prepared four different kinds of test images: Famous, Monitor Easy, Monitor Hard, and Print. Finally, we provide a practicability analysis of our method based on the experimental results on these test images. Additionally, compared with Scale Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT), our approach outperformed by more than 20%.",Art painting detection; Art painting identification; Art painting dataset; Image local feature; Deep learning; Machine learning; Feature extraction

Training an accurate and comprehensive GCNN surrogate for molecular design requires large-scale graph datasets and is usually a time-consuming process. Recent advances in GPUs and distributed computing open a path to reduce the computational cost for GCNN training effectively. However, efficient utilization of high performance computing (HPC) resources for training requires simultaneously optimizing large-scale data management and scalable stochastic batched optimization techniques. In this work, we focus on building GCNN models on HPC systems to predict material properties of millions of molecules. We use HydraGNN, our in-house library for large-scale GCNN training, leveraging distributed data parallelism in PyTorch. We use ADIOS, a high-performance data management framework for efficient storage and reading of large molecular graph data. We perform parallel training on two open-source large-scale graph datasets to build a GCNN predictor for an important quantum property known as the HOMO-LUMO gap.

600,A texture-based method for modeling the background and detecting moving objects,"Heikkila, M; Pietikainen, M",This paper presents a novel and efficient texture-based method for modeling the background and detecting moving objects from a video sequence. Each pixel is modeled as a group of adaptive local binary pattern histograms that are calculated over a circular region around the pixel. The approach provides us with many advantages compared to the state-of-the-art. Experimental results clearly justify our model.,motion; texture; background subtraction; local binary pattern
601,Ontogenetic scaling of the baroreflex function in the green iguana ( Iguana iguana),"Renato Filogonio,Gerson J Rodrigues,Cléo A C Leite,Renato Filogonio,Gerson J Rodrigues,Cléo A C Leite","Large body mass (Mb) in vertebrates is associated with longer pulse intervals between heartbeats (PI) and thicker arterial walls. Longer PI increases the time for diastolic pressure decay, possibly resulting in loss of cardiac energy as ""oscillatory power,"" whereas thicker arterial walls may affect the transmission of impulses and sensing of pressure fluctuations thus impairing baroreflex function. We aimed to investigate the effect of growth on the relative cardiac energy loss and baroreflex function. We predicted that 1) the relative use of cardiac energy should be preserved with increased time constant for pressure decay (τ = vascular resistance × compliance) and 2) if arterial circumferential distensibility does not change, baroreflex function should be unaltered with Mb. To test these hypotheses, we used green iguanas (Iguana iguana) weighing from 0.03 to 1.34 kg (43-fold increment in Mb). PI (P = 0.037) and τ (P = 0.035) increased with Mb, whereas the oscillatory power fraction (P = 0.245) was unrelated to it. Thus, the concomitant alterations of τ and PI allowed the conservation of cardiac energy in larger lizards. Larger animals had thicker arterial walls (P = 0.0007) and greater relative collagen content (P = 0.022). Area compliance scaled positively to Mb (P = 0.045), though circumferential distensibility (P = 0.155) and elastic modulus (P = 0.762) were unaltered. In addition, baroreflex sensitivity, measured by both the pharmacological (P = 0.152) and sequence methods (P = 0.088), and the baroreflex effectiveness index (P = 0.306) were also unrelated to Mb. Therefore, changes in arterial morphology did not affect circumferential distensibility and presumably sensing of pressure fluctuation, and the cardiovagal baroreflex is preserved across different Mb.",body mass; law of Laplace; pharmacological method; sequence method; vascular mechanics.

Infections by the cestode Taenia pisiformis in rabbits is generally not associated with increased mortality of offspring or with loss of maternal body condition but can result in reduced fecundity, and increased circulating progesterone levels have been reported in infected does compared to uninfected ones. In the present study, the possibility that T. pisiformis infection affects fecundity by reducing embryonic implantation was examined. Seven anesthetized New Zealand does were orally infected with 1000 eggs of T. pisiformis, and seven were administered saline. Seven weeks after infection, does were mated, and 7 days after, humanely sacrificed. A decrease in the number of implanted embryos and a decrease in the size of the embryo vesicles in infected does were observed (P ≤ 0.02, Student's t-test). There was a negative correlation between the number of hepatic granulomas and embryo implantation (ρ = - 0.8, P = 0.04, Spearman's test).",Cysticerci; Granulomas; Infection; Reproduction.
603,ASSESSMENT OF THE RISK FOR DEVELOPING A SECOND MALIGNANCY FROM SCATTERED AND SECONDARY RADIATION IN RADIATION THERAPY,"Paganetti, Harald","With the average age of radiation therapy patients decreasing and the advent of more complex treatment options comes the concern that the incidences of radiation-induced cancer might increase in the future. The carcinogenic effects of radiation are not well understood for the entire dose range experienced in radiation therapy. Longer epidemiologic studies are needed to improve current risk models and reduce uncertainties of current risk model parameters. On the other hand, risk estimations are needed today to judge the risks versus benefits of modern radiation therapy techniques. This paper describes the current state-of-the-art in risk modeling for radiation-induced malignancies in radiation therapy, distinguishing between two volumes: first, the organs within the main radiation field receiving low or intermediate doses (typically between 0.1 and 50 Gy); and second, the organs far away from the treatment volume receiving low doses mainly due to scattered and secondary radiation (typically below 0.1 Gy). The dosimetry as well as the risk model formalisms are outlined. Furthermore, example calculations and results are presented for intensity-modulated photon therapy versus proton therapy.

First, to optimize and mine the capability of CNN for village mapping and to ensure compatibility with our classification targets, a few state-of-the-art models were carefully optimized and enhanced based on a series of rigorous analyses and evaluations. Second, rather than directly implementing building identification by using these models, we exploited most of their advantages by ensembling their feature extractor parts into a stronger model called ECNN based on the multiscale feature learning method. Finally, the generated ECNN was applied to a pixel-level classification frame to implement object identification. The proposed method can serve as a viable tool for village building identification with high accuracy and efficiency. The experimental results obtained from the test area in Savannakhet province, Laos, prove that the proposed ECNN model significantly outperforms existing methods, improving overall accuracy from 96.64% to 99.26%, and kappa from 0.57 to 0.86.",Ensemble Convolutional Neural Networks; remote sensing; building detection; village mapping; multiscale feature learning

However, ED is highly ill-posed and gets complicated with increase in number and type of devices, similarity between devices, measurement errors, etc. To design, test, and benchmark ED algorithms, the availability of open-access energy consumption datasets is crucial. Most datasets in the literature suit data-intensive pattern-based ED algorithms. Recently, optimization-based ED algorithms that only require information regarding the operational states of the devices are being developed. However, the lack of standard datasets and appropriate evaluation metrics is hindering the development of reproducible state-of-the-art optimization-based ED algorithms. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a dataset with multiple instances that are representative of the different challenges posed by ED in practice. Performance indicators to empirically evaluate different optimization-based ED algorithms are summarized. In addition, baseline simulation results of the state-of-the-art optimization-based ED algorithms are presented. The developed dataset, summarization of different metrics, and baseline results are expected to provide a platform for researchers to develop novel optimization-based frameworks, in general, and evolutionary computation-based frameworks in particular to solve ED.",non-intrusive load monitoring; optimization-based energy disaggregation; benchmarking; evaluation metrics

A good understanding of the patterns of association between these injuries would aid in efficient multidisciplinary treatment. The aim of this study therefore was to understand the associations between head injury and facial trauma by retrospectively analysing the records of patients seen at a tertiary care trauma centre. Demographic data were also described. Records of 4350 facial trauma patients over a five-year period were reviewed. A total of 3564 (81.9%) patients were victims of motor vehicle accidents (MVA). Male patients predominated, comprising 3711 (85.3%), and 36.6% were in the third decade of life. Facial fractures were seen in 2120 (48.7%), the most common being zygomatic fractures (60%). At the time of trauma, 2383 (57.3%) patients were under the influence of alcohol, and 2821 (87.8%) victims of two-wheeler MVAs were not using their helmet. Of all patients, 29.75% sustained a traumatic brain injury (TBI). Midface fractures were strongly associated with TBI. Maxillofacial injury may be considered a risk factor for TBI, and as such should immediately be suspected and investigated in all patients.

The scope of the application focuses on the problem of motion tracking in video sequences. The framework presented is twofold. First, it is assumed that the samples are time ordered, providing valuable information that is not presented in the current methodologies. Second, the manifold topology comprises multiple charts, which contrasts to the most current methods that assume one single chart, being overly restrictive. The proposed algorithm, Gaussian process multiple local models (GP-MLM), can deal with arbitrary manifold topology by decomposing the manifold into multiple local models that are probabilistic combined using Gaussian process regression. In addition, the paper presents a multiple filter architecture where standard filtering techniques are integrated within the GP-MLM. The proposed approach exhibits comparable performance of state-of-the-art trackers, namely multiple model data association and deep belief networks, and compares favorably with Gaussian process latent variable models. Extensive experiments are presented using real video data, including a publicly available database of lip sequences and left ventricle ultrasound images, in which the GP-MLM achieves state of the art results.",Manifold learning; multiple dynamics; tangent bundle; tracking

Luxenburger introduced four major methodological advances: the use of representative sampling, proband-wise concordance, rigorous zygosity diagnoses, and age correction. He used a narrow Kraepelinian diagnostic approach diagnosis and ascertained twins hospitalized, on a specific day, in all large Bavarian asylums. We include a brief biography of Luxenburger, summarize the findings of his paper and provide a full English translation in the appendix. Luxenburger presents evidence that the frequency of twinning in those with severe mental illness were as expected and reports proband-wise concordance for probable and definite dementia praecox (MZ-76%, DZ-0%) and manic-depressive insanity (MZ-75%, DZ-0%). He also examined eccentricity and hyperthymic or hypothymic personality in the dementia praecox and manic-depressive pairs, respectively.

SCN level was positively associated with overweight/obesity in both children and adolescents, while CIO level was negatively associated with overweight/obesity only in children; however, no significant association was found for NO level. Similar associations were found between SCN level and central obesity. Thus, our results suggest that SCN exposure was associated with overweight/obesity and central obesity in both children and adolescents, while a negative association was observed for CIO in children.

In this study, students' demographic variables, psychological capital (which includes four sub-constructs), and self-concept (which includes five sub-constructs) were used as predicting variables to estimate their influences on dance class students' stress level. A structured questionnaire was distributed to 450 elementary art talent class students with 412 valid responses. Structural equation modeling was used to test the relationships proposed by the study. As for demographic variables, the results show that the grade, gender, and the dance class hours per week had no significant influences on stress, while the seniority level had a negative influence, which indicated that junior dance students had more stress than senior students. As for psychological capital, self-efficacy and optimism had negative influences on stress, while the other two sub-constructs, hope and resilience, did not have a significant influence on stress.

613,Privileged Modality Distillation for Vessel Border Detection in Intracoronary Imaging,"Gao, Zhifan; Chung, Jonathan; Abdelrazek, Mohamed; Leung, Stephanie; Hau, William Kongto; Xian, Zhanchao; Zhang, Heye; Li, Shuo","Intracoronary imaging is a crucial imaging technology in coronary disease diagnosis as it visualizes the internal tissue morphologies of coronary arteries. Vessel border detection in intracoronary images (VBDI) is desired because it can help the succeeding procedures of computer-aided disease diagnosis. However, existing VDBI methods suffer from the challenge of vessel-environment variability (i.e. high intra- and inter-subject diversity of vessels and their surrounding tissues appeared in images). This challenge leads to the ineffectiveness in the vessel region representation for hand-crafted features, in the receptive field extraction for deeply-represented features, as well as performance suppression derived from clinical data limitation. To solve this challenge, we propose a novel privileged modality distillation (PMD) framework for VBDI. PMD transforms the single-input-single-task (SIST) learning problem in the single-mode VBDI to a multiple-input-multiple-task (MIMT) problem by using the privileged image modality to help the learning model in the target modality. This learns the enriched high-level knowledge with similar semantics and generalizes PMD on diversity-increased low-level image features for improving the model adaptation to diverse vessel environments. Moreover, PMD refines MIMT to SIST by distilling the learned knowledge from multiple to one modality. This eliminates the reliance on privileged modality in the test phase, and thus enables the applicability to each of different intracoronary modalities. A structure-deformable neural network is proposed as an elaborately-designed implementation of PMD. It expands a conventional SIST network structure to the MIMT structure, and then recovers it to the final SIST structure. The PMD is validated on intravascular ultrasound imaging and optical coherence tomography imaging. One modality is the target, and the other one can be considered as the privileged modality owing to their semantic relatedness. The experiments show that our PMD is effective in VBDI (e.g. the Dice index is larger than 0.95), as well as superior to six state-of-the-art VBDI methods.",Vessel border detection; privileged information; knowledge distillation; intravascular ultrasound; optical coherence tomography

Computer aided diagnosis (CAD) is a useful tool to help doctors make better decisions in cancer diagnosis and treatment. Accurate cell detection is often an essential prerequisite for subsequent cellular analysis. The major challenge of robust brain tumor nuclei/cell detection is to handle significant variations in cell appearance and to split touching cells. In this paper, we present an automatic cell detection framework using sparse reconstruction and adaptive dictionary learning. The main contributions of our method are: 1) A sparse reconstruction based approach to split touching cells; 2) An adaptive dictionary learning method used to handle cell appearance variations. The proposed method has been extensively tested on a data set with more than 2000 cells extracted from 32 whole slide scanned images. The automatic cell detection results are compared with the manually annotated ground truth and other state-of-the-art cell detection algorithms.

In this paper, we propose a deep Renyi entropy graph kernel for this purpose. We gauge the deep information through a family of h-layer expansion subgraphs rooted at a vertex, and define a h-layer depth-based second-order Renyi entropy representation for each vertex. The second-order Renyi entropy representation is used together with Euclidean distance to build a deep second-order Renyi entropy graph kernel (SREGK). For graphs with n vertices, the time complexity for our kernel is O(n(3)). This low-order polynomial complexity enables our subgraph kernels to easily scale up to graphs of reasonably large sizes and thus overcome the size limits arising in state-of-the-art graph kernels. Experimental results on fourteen real world graph datasets are shown to demonstrate the overall superior performance of our approach over a number of state-of-the-art methods. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Although much progress has been made in the field of visual target tracking, there are still challenging scenarios in which even state-of-the-art trackers do not operate reliably. For instance, most trackers are prone to drift if a target moves abruptly in unexpected directions, or reappears after being fully occluded by the clutters or disappeared from the field of view of a camera. To cope with these scenarios effectively, the proposed tracking system subdivides the task of visual target tracking into two subtasks, i.e., tracking and detection. 1) For target-visible frames, the tracker builds a collaborative framework with the proposed appearance, observation, and motion models thereby achieving robust performance against unexpected motions and appearance changes of a target and 2) for target-invisible frames, the detector verifies continuously whether a target candidate is the lost target or clutter thereby reducing false target alarms effectively. In extensive experiments, the proposed tracking system shows very promising performance in comparison with state-of-the-art tracking methods.",Occlusion detection; online linear discriminator (OLD); target-specific feature descriptor; visual target tracking

The key feature is the use of an easily wearable garment printed with colour-coded pattern and a generic multicamera setup with standard video cameras. The coded pattern allows a high-density distribution of markers per unit of surface (about 40 markers per 100 cm), avoiding markers-swap errors. The high density of markers reconstructed makes possible a simultaneous reconstruction of shape and motion, which gives several concurrent advantages with respect to the state of the art and providing performances comparable with previous marker-based systems. In particular, we provide effective solutions to counter the soft-tissue artefact which is a common problem for garment-based techniques. This effect is reduced using Point Cluster Technique to filter out the points strongly affected by non-rigid motion. Uncertainty of motion estimation has been experimentally quantified by comparing with a state-of-the-art commercial system and numerically predicted by means of a Monte Carlo Method procedure. The experimental evaluation was performed on three different articulated motions: shoulder, knee and hip flexion-extension. The results shows that for the three motion angles estimated with GaMoCap, the system provides comparable accuracies against a commercial VICON system.",3D reconstruction; Motion capture; Structure-from-motion; Multi-camera systems; Soft-tissue artefacts

626,Multiple influences of working memory capacity on number comprehension: The interplay with metacognition and number-specific prerequisites,"Elisa Bisagno,Alessia Cadamuro,Sergio Morra,Elisa Bisagno,Alessia Cadamuro,Sergio Morra","A wide literature has studied the predictors of number comprehension and early math learning by considering both domain-general and number-specific prerequisites. However, a consensus has not been reached regarding the specific contribution of these prerequisites. This study aimed to analyze the contribution and interplay of two domain-general functions, working memory (WM) and metacognitive abilities, and number-specific prerequisites in determining number comprehension. The participants, 126 Italian first-graders, were tested on two WM capacity tasks, an early metacognition questionnaire, five number-specific prerequisites tasks (e.g., quantity and/or size comparison; placement of Arabic numeral), and the Number Knowledge Test for whole-number comprehension. We hypothesized that WM capacity would predict number comprehension both directly and indirectly via metacognition and domain-specific prerequisites. This is because both metacognition and domain-specific prerequisites might place an information load on WM to establish schemes for declarative metamemory and metacognitive monitoring and for emerging counting skills, respectively. The results confirmed these hypotheses. WM capacity was positively associated with number comprehension both directly and via increased metacognition and domain-specific prerequisites. These findings offer a model for interpreting the interplay between domain-general and number-specific predictors of whole-number comprehension, but they also underline the multiple ways in which WM capacity affects it.",Math cognition; Metacognition; Number comprehension; Number-specific prerequisites; Primary school; Working memory capacity.

M.; Rossi, Davide; Coussy, Philippe; Benini, Luca","In this paper, we give a fresh look to coarse grained reconfigurable arrays (CGRAs) as ultralow power accelerators for near-sensor processing. We present a general-purpose integrated programmable-array accelerator (IPA) exploiting a novel architecture, execution model, and compilation flow for application mapping that can handle kernels containing complex control flow, without the significant energy overhead incurred by state of the art predication approaches. To optimize the performance and energy efficiency, we explore the IPA architecture with special focus on shared memory access, with the help of the flexible compilation flow presented in this paper. We achieve a maximum energy gain of 2x, and performance gain of 1.33x and 1.8x compared with state of the art partial and full predication techniques, respectively. The proposed accelerator achieves an average energy efficiency of 1617 MOPS/mW operating at 100 MHz, 0.6 V in 28 nm UTBB FD-SOI technology, over a wide range of near-sensor processing kernels, leading to an improvement up to 18x, with an average of 9.23x (as well as a speed-up up to 20.3x, with an average of 9.7x) compared to a core specialized for ultralow power near-sensor processing.",Coarse grain reconfigurable array (CGRA); compilation; computer architecture; control and data flow graph (CDFG); control flow; ultralow power accelerator
628,Remove Cosine Window From Correlation Filter-Based Visual Trackers: When and How,"Li, Feng; Wu, Xiaohe; Zuo, Wangmeng; Zhang, David; Zhang, Lei","Correlation filters (CFs) have been continuously advancing the state-of-the-art tracking performance and have been extensively studied in the recent few years. Nonetheless, the existing CF trackers adopt a cosine window to spatially reweight base image to alleviate boundary discontinuity. However, cosine window emphasizes more on the central regions of base image and has the risk of contaminating negative training samples during model learning. On the other hand, spatial regularization deployed in many recent CF trackers plays a similar role as cosine window by enforcing spatial penalty on CF coefficients. Therefore, we in this paper investigate the feasibility to remove cosine window from CF trackers with spatial regularization. When simply removing cosine window, CF with spatial regularization still suffers from small degree of boundary discontinuity. To tackle this issue, binary and Gaussian shaped mask functions are further introduced for eliminating boundary discontinuity while reweighting the estimation error of each training sample, and can be incorporated with multiple CF trackers with spatial regularization. In comparison to the baseline methods with cosine window, our methods are effective in handling boundary discontinuity and sample contamination, thereby benefiting tracking performance. Extensive experiments on four benchmarks show that our methods perform favorably against the state-of-the-art trackers using either handcrafted or deep CNN features.",Contamination; Microsoft Windows; Training; Computational efficiency; Adaptation models; Correlation; Convolution; Visual tracking; correlation filters; cosine window; spatial regularization
629,Automatic portrait oil painter: joint domain stylization for portrait images,"Yang, Saboya; Yang, Shuai; Yang, Wenhan; Liu, Jiaying","Everyone has the dream of being in the center of famous art paintings, admired by numerous future generations. However, the dream came true at a huge cost of the painter's commission in old days. In our paper, another practical choice is provided for everyone to achieve that dream - an automatic portrait oil painter transferring some artistic styles from one single reference painting. To address this issue, we propose a joint-domain image stylization approach, particularly for portrait oil paintings. From the view of artistic appreciation, we analyze an amount of oil painting art works and summarize three critical factors to depict the figure, i.e. color, structure and texture. Based on this point, we separate and represent an artistic work into these three domains. Then, considering their intrinsic properties and following an art creation route, we propose the corresponding approaches to jointly model and transfer the features in these domains. First, a swatch-based color adjustment is proposed to recolor the tone of the input image based on semantic regions corresponding to the references. Second, the main structures of the input image is maintained by sparse reconstruction. Third, a coarse-to-fine texture synthesis is used to enhance the detail oil painting patterns. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves desirable results compared with state-of-the-art methods in not only transferring the styles from references but also keeping consistent contents with the given portrait.",Image stylization; Saliency aware; Dictionary learning; Texture synthesis

Research into potential vaccine design and production is focused on the spike (S) protein of the virus, which is critical for virus entry into host cells. Yet, whether the degree of glycosylation in the S protein is associated with vaccine efficacy remains unclear. Here, we first optimized the expression of the S protein in mammalian cells. While we found no significant discrepancy in purity, homogeneity, or receptor binding ability among S proteins derived from 293F cells (referred to as 293F S-2P), 293S GnTI- cells (defective in N-acetylglucosaminyl transferase I enzyme; 293S S-2P), or TN-5B1-4 insect cells (Bac S-2P), there was significant variation in the glycosylation patterns and thermal stability of the proteins. Compared with the partially glycosylated 293S S-2P or Bac S-2P, the fully glycosylated 293F S-2P exhibited higher binding reactivity to convalescent sera. In addition, 293F S-2P induced higher IgG and neutralizing antibody titres than 293S or Bac S-2P in mice. Furthermore, a prime-boost-boost regimen, using a combined immunization of S-2P proteins with various degrees of glycosylation, elicited a more robust neutralizing antibody response than a single S-2P alone. Collectively, this study provides insight into ways to design a more effective SARS-CoV-2 immunogen.",293 cells; Glycosylation; Immunogenicity; SARS-CoV-2; Spike.
632,A Krasnoselskii-Mann Algorithm With an Improved EM Preconditioner for PET Image Reconstruction,"Lin, Yizun; Schmidtlein, C. Ross; Li, Qia; Li, Si; Xu, Yuesheng","This paper presents a preconditioned Krasnoselskii-Mann (KM) algorithm with an improved EM preconditioner (IEM-PKMA) for higher-order total variation (HOTV) regularized positron emission tomography (PET) image reconstruction. The PET reconstruction problem can be formulated as a three-term convex optimization model consisting of the Kullback-Leibler (KL) fidelity term, a nonsmooth penalty term, and a nonnegative constraint term which is also nonsmooth. We develop an efficient KM algorithm for solving this optimization problem based on a fixed-point characterization of its solution, with a preconditioner and a momentum technique for accelerating convergence. By combining the EM precondtioner, a thresholding, and a good inexpensive estimate of the solution, we propose an improved EM preconditioner that can not only accelerate convergence but also avoid the reconstructed image being ""stuck at zero."" Numerical results in this paper show that the proposed IEM-PKMA outperforms existing state-of-the-art algorithms including, the optimization transfer descent algorithm and the preconditioned L-BFGS-B algorithm for the differentiable smoothed anisotropic total variation regularized model, the preconditioned alternating projection algorithm, and the alternating direction method of multipliers for the nondifferentiable HOTV regularized model.

Specifically two classifiers are built, and two different parameterizations have been applied for the QCD. For testing QArt-Learn approach, the Painting-91 dataset has been used, from which the paintings corresponding to Velazquez, Vermeer, Monet, Renoir, van Gogh and Gauguin were extracted, resulting in a set of 252 paintings. The results obtained have shown categorization accuracies higher than 65%, which are comparable to accuracies obtained in the literature. However, QArt-Learn uses qualitative color names which can describe style color palettes linguistically, so that they can be better understood by non-experts in art since QCDs are aligned with human perception.

We discuss the relationship with other edge-based deblurring methods and present how to select salient edges more principally. For the final latent image restoration step, we present an effective method to remove artifacts for better deblurred results.

An alternative to DAS consists in using iterative techniques, which require both an accurate measurement model and a strong prior on the image under scrutiny. Toward this goal, much effort has been deployed in formulating models for US imaging, which usually require a large amount of memory to store the matrix coefficients. We present two different techniques, which take advantage of fast and matrix-free formulations derived for the measurement model and its adjoint, and rely on sparsity of US images in well-chosen models. Sparse regularization is used for enhanced image reconstruction. Compressed beamforming exploits the compressed sensing framework to restore high-quality images from fewer raw data than state-of-the-art approaches. Using simulated data and in vivo experimental acquisitions, we show that the proposed approach is three orders of magnitude faster than non-DAS state-of-the-art methods, with comparable or better image quality.",Beamforming; compressed sensing (CS); sparse regularization (SR); ultrafast ultrasound (US) imaging

We propose a design that aims at maximizing the security gap, which is defined as the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) difference between the destination and an eavesdropper, subject to security and reliability constraints defining the thresholds on the received signals' SNR values at the destination and the eavesdropper. A fractional quadratically constrained quadratic program (QCQP) is formulated, which is solved analytically and closed-form expressions are determined for both protocols. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed designs achieve the same performance for the secrecy rate under both strategies compared with state-of-the-art approaches, for a proper choice of thresholds on SNR values. Additionally, for relaxed thresholds and at the cost of a slight decrease on the optimal secrecy rate value, the received SNR values at the eavesdropper are greatly decreased for the CJ protocol and even more for the DF protocol, while guaranteeing target SNR values at the destination, compared with previous state-of-the-art approaches.",Cooperative jamming; cooperative relaying; fractional programming; low-resource devices; physical layer security; wireless communications

In-the-lab datasets are collected under class-balanced distribution. By contrast, samples in the real world are more complex and imbalanced. Traditional data augmentation (DA) methods apply random operation amplitudes and unidirectional expansions in the feature space, which leads to bias in classes with more samples. Our paper proposes a DA model and combines it with a feature enhancement mechanism for unbalanced facial emotion recognition. We introduce a learning-based dynamic sample adjustment mechanism that selects the most valuable samples to guide the training process of each sample's augmentation parameters. It explores each sample's maximum augmentation potential and increases the accuracy in a class-balanced way. Compared with state-of-the-art methods on the facial emotion recognition task, it achieves the best average accuracy of 86.08% on the real-world affective faces database, outperforming the state-of-the-art imbalanced learning methods.

All children received 150 min/week of common practice (CP) PE from general classroom teachers but in 13 schools 100 min/week of CP PE was replaced by specialized-led PE (SPE) by teachers who emphasized more vigorous exercise/games combined with static and dynamic postural activities involving muscle strength. Outcome measures assessed in grades 2, 4, and 6 included: total body bone mineral content (BMC), lean mass (LM), and fat mass (FM) by DXA, and radius and tibia (4% and 66% sites) bone structure, volumetric density and strength, and muscle cross-sectional area (CSA) by pQCT. After 4-years, gains in total body BMC, FM, and muscle CSA were similar between the groups in both sexes, but girls in the SPE group experienced a greater gain in total body LM (mean 1.0 kg; 95% CI, 0.2 to 1.9 kg). Compared to CP, girls in the SPE group also had greater gains in cortical area (CoA) and cortical thickness (CoTh) at the mid-tibia (CoA, 5.0% [95% CI, 0.2% to 1.9%]; CoTh, 7.5% [95% CI, 2.4% to 12.6%]) and mid-radius (CoA, 9.3% [95% CI, 3.5% to 15.1%]; CoTh, 14.4% [95% CI, 6.1% to 22.7%]), whereas SPE boys had a 5.2% (95% CI, 0.4% to 10.0%) greater gain in mid-tibia CoTh. These benefits were due to reduced endocortical expansion. There were no significant benefits of SPE on total bone area, cortical density or bone strength at the mid-shaft sites, nor any appreciable effects at the distal skeletal sites. This study indicates that a specialist-led school-based PE program improves cortical bone structure, due to reduced endocortical expansion.

The objective was to compare HPV vaccination rates among medically underserved, economically disadvantaged, students in rural middle school districts (Rio Grande Valley [RGV], Texas) by age of initiation (≤ age 11 years vs. age 12 years and older). This quasi-experimental study included 1,766 students (884 females; 882 males) who received at least one HPV vaccine dose through our school-based vaccination program between 08/2016-06/2022. Summary statistics were stratified by age at initiation and gender. The overall HPV up-to-date (UTD) rate was 59.7% (95% Confidence Interval: 57.4-62.0%). The median age at HPV UTD (range) was 12 years (9-19) and median interval between HPV vaccine doses (range) was 316 days (150-2,855). Most students received the HPV vaccine bundled with other vaccinations (72.4%, 1,279/1,766). There was a higher HPV UTD rate among students who initiated the HPV vaccine on or before age 11 than those who initiated on or after age 12 (73.6% versus 45.1%, respectively). The median age of HPV UTD was age 12 for those initiating on or before 11 years versus age 13 for those initiating on or after 12 years of age.

However, some CML patients are resistant to imatinib therapy, the initial TKI therapy in the CML. Therefore, it is important to find prognostic markers for resistance. The OCT-1 gene involved in imatinib uptake is also suspected to cause imatinib resistance. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of OCT-1 in imatinib resistance by comparing OCT-1 expression levels in imatinib resistant and imatinib sensitive patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). This study was conducted on 101 patients with CML [imatinib sensitive (n = 51) and imatinib resistant (n = 50)] who were treated with imatinib. Gene expression analysis was done using QRT-PCR. The relative expression levels of OCT-1 were calculated using 2(-ΔΔCT) method. OCT1 mRNA expression levels were 0.149 (0.011-2.532) and 0.119 (0.008-2.868) in imatinib-sensitive group and imatinib-resistant group, respectively. OCT-1 expression levels were not significantly different in the imatinib-sensitive group when compared to imatinib resistant group (p > 0.05). OCT-1 expression was also similar in BCR-ABL1 kinase domain mutation positive and negative cases (p > 0.05). The imatinib-resistant group had a higher rate of hydroxyurea or interferon-alpha treatment prior to imatinib therapy and a lower rate for first-line imatinib as the only treatment than the imatinib-sensitive group (p = 0.002 and p = 0.002, respectively). According to the results of our study, OCT-1 does not have a biomarker feature in the evaluation of imatinib response.

The spatio-temporal risk of LTFU is useful to identify hotspots and guide policy. Secondary data on adult HIV patients attending a clinic in provinces of Zimbabwe between 2009 and 2016 were used to estimate the LTFU risk in each of the 10 provinces. A hierarchical Bayesian spatio-temporal Poisson regression model was fitted using the Integrated Nested Laplace Approximation (INLA) package with LTFU as counts adjusting for age, gender, WHO clinical stage, tuberculosis coinfection and duration on ART. The structured random effects were modelled using the conditional autoregression technique and the temporal random effects were modelled using first-order random walk Gaussian priors. The overall rate of LTFU was 22.7% (95%CI: 22.6/22.8) with Harare (50.28%) and Bulawayo (31.11%) having the highest rates. A one-year increase in the average number of years on ART reduced the risk of LTFU by 35% (relative risk (RR) = 0.651; 95%CI: 0.592-0.712). In general, the provinces with the highest exceedance LTFU risk were Matabeleland South and Matabeleland North. LTFU is one of the drawbacks of HIV prevention.

A CWM demodulator is designed and fabricated in 130-nm CMOS technology. The proposed demodulator is intended for implantable medical devices, but can be applicable to other wireless systems. Excellent measurement results are obtained in comparison with state-of-the-art demodulators used in inductive communication systems. The proposed demodulator that was designed, fabricated, and tested provides high data rates at an ultra-low power budget and a very small silicon area of 2100 mu m(2). More specifically, a data rate of 9.04 Mb/s can be achieved at a cost of only 13.68 mu W power consumption. This represents an energy efficiency of 1.5 pJ/bit, which is 8 times smaller than the best state-of-the-art competitive demodulator.",Inductive link; downlink data transmission; carrier width modulation; CWM demodulator

This article describes efforts to define interprofessional nursing home staff roles within the partnership-based COVID-19 Response Guideline, and to examine changes in nursing practice compared to the pre-pandemic practice of nurses. The qualitative process of identification of nursing home staff roles revealed the extensive scope of interprofessional partnership needed to respond to the pandemic. Using the Omaha System structure, we compared these collective COVID-19 response interventions of Nursing Service roles with nursing interventions of RNs and LPN/LVNs defined in previous nursing home studies. This comparison showed the necessary transformation and collaboration among nurses needed for the pandemic response in nursing homes. The Omaha System Pandemic Guideline is available online and in the Omaha System Guidelines app for immediate use as COVID-19 response practice guidelines and references for interprofessional roles in nursing homes, as well as for multidisciplinary roles across diverse care settings. The guideline is an exemplar of how informatics can facilitate interprofessional and multidisciplinary partnership for nursing homes and other care settings.

649,Adjoint model enhanced plume reconstruction from tomographic remote sensing measurements,"Olaguer, Eduardo P.","A new mathematical optimization method is presented for reconstructing pollution plume concentrations from tomographic remote sensing measurements on neighborhood scales (about 1 km x 1 km) using Differential Optical Absorption Spectroscopy (DOAS). The new method, called CAT-4Dvar, combines Computer Aided Tomography (CAT) and 4D variational (4Dvar) data assimilation. The objective of the method is to produce accurate reconstructions compared to the Algebraic Reconstruction Technique (ART) and other non-variational methods with only a small number of DOAS telescopes. A forward and adjoint 3D grid dispersion model was developed based on advection and diffusion solvers commonly used in air quality modeling. The adjoint model optimizes the model emissions and horizontal diffusion coefficient based on the difference between tomographic DOAS observations and ray path-integrated concentrations predicted by the forward model. It also updates the corresponding error covariances based on the Hessian of the cost function. An enhanced reconstruction is obtained from the forward model with optimized parameter values. In a synthetic experiment involving two hypothetical DOAS instruments, the CAT-4Dvar method yielded excellent results compared to ART, reducing the overall nearness index from 57% to 11%.

However, bony boundaries are blurry in MRI, and structural information needs to be borrowed from CT during the training. This is challenging since paired MRI-CT data are typically scarce. In this paper, we propose to make full use of unpaired data, which are typically abundant, along with a single paired MRI-CT data to construct a one-shot generative adversarial model for automated MRI segmentation of CMF bony structures. Our model consists of a cross- modality image synthesis sub- network, which learns the mapping between CT and MRI, and an MRI segmentation sub- network. These two sub-networks are trained jointly in an end-to-end manner. Moreover, in the training phase, a neighbor- based anchoring method is proposed to reduce the ambiguity problem inherent in cross-modality synthesis, and a feature- matching- based semantic consistency constraint is proposed to encourage segmentation- oriented MRI synthesis. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our method both qualitatively and quantitatively in comparison with the state-of-the-art MRI segmentation methods.",Craniomaxillofacial bone segmentation; MRI; generative adversarial learning; one-shot learning
652,Online Estimation of Reverberation Parameters For Late Residual Echo Suppression,"Desiraju, Naveen Kumar; Doclo, Simon; Buck, Markus; Wolff, Tobias","In hands-free telephony and other distant-talk applications, often a short AEC filter is used to achieve fast convergence at low computational cost. As a result, a significant amount of late residual echo (LRE) may remain, especially in highly reverberant environments. This LRE can be suppressed using a postfilter in the subband domain, which requires an estimate of the power spectral density (PSD) of the LRE. To estimate the LRE PSD, an exponentially decaying model with frequency-dependent reverberation scaling and decay parameters has frequently been assumed. State-of-the-art methods estimate both reverberation parameters independently of each other, either in offline or in online mode. In this article, we propose two signal-based methods (i.e. output error and equation error) to jointly estimate both reverberation parameters in online mode. The estimated parameters are then used to generate an estimate for the LRE PSD, which is fed into a postfilter for the purpose of late residual echo suppression. We derive several gradient-descent-based algorithms to simultaneously update both reverberation parameters, minimizing either the mean squared error or the mean squared log error cost function. The proposed methods are compared with state-of-the-art methods in terms of the accuracy of the estimated reverberation parameters and the corresponding LRE PSD estimate. Extensive simulation results using both artificial as well as measured room impulse responses show that the proposed output error method with mean squared log error minimization outperforms state-of-the-art methods in all considered scenarios.",Reverberation; Microphones; Noise measurement; Cost function; Speech processing; Estimation; Acoustic echo cancellation; adaptive filters; late residual echo estimation; residual echo suppression

We place LDP into the context of state-of-the-art discriminant projections and analyze its properties. LDP requires a large set of training data with point-to-point correspondence ground truth. We demonstrate that training data produced by a simulation of image transformations leads to nearly the same results as the real data with correspondence ground truth. This makes it possible to apply LDP as well as other discriminant projection approaches to the problems where the correspondence ground truth is not available, such as image categorization. We perform an extensive experimental evaluation on standard data sets in the context of image matching and categorization. We demonstrate that LDP enables significant dimensionality reduction of local descriptors and performance increases in different applications.

The dry ball milling of graphite with additives produces edge-selectively functionalized graphene. However, the ""inert"" additives require a long milling time and cause inevitable in-plane defects. Here, the mechanochemical reaction of graphite with persulfate solved the above drawback and produced edge-selectively hydroxylated graphene (EHG) nanosheets through a 2 h ball-milling and a subsequent 0.5 h sonication. The mechanochemical cleavage of persulfate yielded SO4 ⋅- to spontaneously oxidize graphite to form the carbon radical cations selectively at edges, followed by hydroxylation with water of moisture. Because the O-O bond dissociation energy of persulfate is 20 % of the graphitic C-C bond, the rather low milling energy allowed the hydroxylation of graphite at edges with nearly no in-plane defects. The obtained EHG showed high water-dispersibility and excellent photothermal and electrochemical properties, thereby opening up a new door to fabricate graphene-based composites.",ball milling; carbon materials; graphene; green chemistry; mechanochemistry.

The aims of this study were 1) quantifying twelve CECs (including pharmaceutical, stimulant, and artificial sweetener compounds) in both untreated and treated wastewater samples in a Brazilian wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) using bidimensional liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry, allowing the selection of five marker (i.e., priority) CECs; 2) evaluating the adsorption potential of such selected CECs [caffeine, hydrochlorothiazide, saccharin, sucralose (SUC), and sulfamethoxazole (SMX)] onto coconut-shell granular activated carbon (GAC); and 3) investigating the removal of the same CECs by a multi-barrier system (pilot-scale, 350 L h-1) treating the effluent of the WWTP and composed of reverse osmosis (RO), photoperoxidation (UV/H2O2), and filtration with GAC. Such technologies were tested separately and in binary or ternary combinations. Eleven and eight CECs were detected and quantified on the untreated and treated wastewater samples of the Brazilian WWTP, respectively. For the treated wastewater, the concentrations ranged from 499 ng L-1 (SMX) to 87,831 ng L-1 (SUC). The adsorption onto AC data fitted the Sips isotherm model, indicating monolayer chemisorption, which was also suggested by the mean adsorption energy values (>16 kJ mol-1). SMX and SUC were the most and the least adsorbed CECs (4.33 and 1.21 mg g-1, respectively). Concerning the pilot-scale treatment plant, the ternary combination (RO + UV/H2O2+GAC) removed >99% of the five marker CECs and promoted reductions on water color, turbidity, as well as on nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations. Further studies on water reuse could prioritize the selected marker CECs as quality indicators. While the removal of marker CECs is one of the WHO performance requirements, the RO + UV/H2O2+GAC system showed promising results as a first approach to direct potable reuse of water.",Advanced wastewater treatment; Emerging contaminants; Granular activated carbon; Pilot-scale; Water reuse.

Architectural innovations of F-CNNs have mainly been on improving spatial encoding or network connectivity to aid gradient flow. In this paper, we aim toward an alternate direction of recalibrating the learned feature maps adaptively, boosting meaningful features while suppressing weak ones. The recalibration is achieved by simple computational blocks that can be easily integrated in F-CNNs architectures. We draw our inspiration from the recently proposed ""squeeze and excitation"" (SE) modules for channel recalibration for image classification. Toward this end, we introduce three variants of SE modules for segmentation: 1) squeezing spatially and exciting channel wise; 2) squeezing channel wise and exciting spatially; and 3) joint spatial and channel SE. We effectively incorporate the proposed SE blocks in three state-of-the-art F-CNNs and demonstrate a consistent improvement of segmentation accuracy on three challenging benchmark datasets. Importantly, SE blocks only lead to a minimal increase in model complexity of about 1.5%, while the Dice score increases by 4%-9% in the case of U-Net. Hence, we believe that SE blocks can be an integral part of future F-CNN architectures.",Fully convolutional networks; image segmentation; squeeze & excitation
660,A Comparison of Deep Learning Methods for Timbre Analysis in Polyphonic Automatic Music Transcription,"Hernandez-Olivan, Carlos; Zay Pinilla, Ignacio; Hernandez-Lopez, Carlos; Beltran, Jose R.","Automatic music transcription (AMT) is a critical problem in the field of music information retrieval (MIR). When AMT is faced with deep neural networks, the variety of timbres of different instruments can be an issue that has not been studied in depth yet. The goal of this work is to address AMT transcription by analyzing how timbre affect monophonic transcription in a first approach based on the CREPE neural network and then to improve the results by performing polyphonic music transcription with different timbres with a second approach based on the Deep Salience model that performs polyphonic transcription based on the Constant-Q Transform. The results of the first method show that the timbre and envelope of the onsets have a high impact on the AMT results and the second method shows that the developed model is less dependent on the strength of the onsets than other state-of-the-art models that deal with AMT on piano sounds such as Google Magenta Onset and Frames (OaF). Our polyphonic transcription model for non-piano instruments outperforms the state-of-the-art model, such as for bass instruments, which has an F-score of 0.9516 versus 0.7102.

Biallelic mutations in GBA1 reduce lysosomal acid β-glucosidase activity, and its substrates, glucosylceramide and glucosylsphingosine, accumulate. Enzyme replacement therapy and substrate reduction therapy ameliorate systemic features of Gaucher disease, but no therapies are approved for neurological manifestations. Venglustat is an investigational, brain-penetrant, glucosylceramide synthase inhibitor with potential to improve the disease by rebalancing influx of glucosylceramide with impaired lysosomal recycling. The Phase 2, open-label LEAP trial (NCT02843035) evaluated orally administered venglustat 15 mg once-daily in combination with maintenance dose of imiglucerase enzyme replacement therapy during 1 year of treatment in 11 adults with Gaucher disease type 3. Primary endpoints were venglustat safety and tolerability and change in concentration of glucosylceramide and glucosylsphingosine in CSF from baseline to Weeks 26 and 52. Secondary endpoints included change in plasma concentrations of glucosylceramide and glucosylsphingosine, venglustat pharmacokinetics in plasma and CSF, neurologic function, infiltrative lung disease and systemic disease parameters. Exploratory endpoints included changes in brain volume assessed with volumetric MRI using tensor-based morphometry, and resting functional MRI analysis of regional brain activity and connectivity between resting state networks. Mean (SD) plasma venglustat AUC0-24 on Day 1 was 851 (282) ng•h/ml; Cmax of 58.1 (26.4) ng/ml was achieved at a median tmax 2.00 h. After once-daily venglustat, plasma concentrations (4 h post-dose) were higher compared with Day 1, indicating ∼2-fold accumulation. One participant (Patient 9) had low-to-undetectable venglustat exposure at Weeks 26 and 52. Based on mean plasma and CSF venglustat concentrations (excluding Patient 9), steady state appeared to be reached on or before Week 4. Mean (SD) venglustat concentration at Week 52 was 114 (65.8) ng/ml in plasma and 6.14 (3.44) ng/ml in CSF. After 1 year of treatment, median (inter-quartile range) glucosylceramide decreased 78% (72, 84) in plasma and 81% (77, 83) in CSF; median (inter-quartile range) glucosylsphingosine decreased 56% (41, 60) in plasma and 70% (46, 76) in CSF. Ataxia improved slightly in nine patients: mean (SD, range) total modified Scale for Assessment and Rating of Ataxia score decreased from 2.68 [1.54 (0.0 to 5.5)] at baseline to 1.55 [1.88 (0.0 to 5.0)] at Week 52 [mean change: -1.14 (95% CI: -2.06 to -0.21)]. Whole brain volume increased slightly in patients with venglustat exposure and biomarker reduction in CSF (306.7 ± 4253.3 mm3) and declined markedly in Patient 9 (-13894.8 mm3). Functional MRI indicated stronger connectivity at Weeks 26 and 52 relative to baseline between a broadly distributed set of brain regions in patients with venglustat exposure and biomarker reduction but not Patient 9, although neurocognition, assessed by Vineland II, deteriorated in all domains over time, which illustrates disease progression despite the intervention. There were no deaths, serious adverse events or discontinuations.

Lots of popular SR approaches are more likely either time-or space-intensive, which limit their practical applications. Hence, some research has focused on a subspace view and delivered state-of-the-art results. In this paper, we utilize an effective way with mixture prior models to transform the large nonlinear feature space of LR images into a group of linear subspaces in the training phase. In particular, we first partition image patches into several groups by a novel selective patch processing method based on difference curvature of LR patches, and then learning the mixture prior models in each group. Moreover, different prior distributions have various effectiveness in SR, and in this case, we find that student-t prior shows stronger performance than the well-known Gaussian prior. In the testing phase, we adopt the learned multiple mixture prior models to map the input LR features into the appropriate subspace, and finally reconstruct the corresponding HR image in a novel mixed matching way. Experimental results indicate that the proposed approach is both quantitatively and qualitatively superior to some state-of-the-art SR methods.",Student-t mixture models; selective patch processing; difference curvature; mixed matching

To ensure good generalizability of deep networks under small sample sizes, learning discriminative features is crucial. To this end, several loss functions have been proposed to encourage large intra-class compactness and inter-class separability. In this paper, we propose to enhance the discriminative power of features from a new perspective by introducing a novel neural network termed Relation-and-Margin learning Network (ReMarNet). Our method assembles two networks of different backbones so as to learn the features that can perform excellently in both of the aforementioned two classification mechanisms. Specifically, a relation network is used to learn the features that can support classification based on the similarity between a sample and a class prototype; at the meantime, a fully connected network with the cross entropy loss is used for classification via the decision boundary. Experiments on four image datasets demonstrate that our approach is effective in learning discriminative features from a small set of labeled samples and achieves competitive performance against state-of-the-art methods.

In this chapter a couple of methods are described that are used to detect modulation of SIRT7 in response to DNA damage. SIRT7 is localized in the nucleoli and binds to the chromatin after DNA damage. Therefore, a protocol was optimized by our lab for chromatin fractionation. By this method, the movement of SIRT7 can be detected from the soluble part (cytosol+nucleoplasm) to the solid part (chromatin) of the cell. Change of SIRT7 expression levels, in different cells or after different treatment, can be detected by isolating whole-cell lysate followed by Western blotting. For analyzing binding of SIRT7 to other substrates, we have also optimized manual immunoprecipitation assays by using 1% NP40 buffer. This protocol is very helpful to pull down SIRT7 and associated proteins by using a single buffer. SIRT7 is a deacetylase, and its deacetylation activity can be checked both inside the cell by in vivo deacetylation assay and outside the cell by in vitro deacetylation assays. Recently it was also discovered that SIRT7 has desuccinylase activity which can be detected by histone desuccinylation assay. This chapter provides the methodology of SIRT7 detection in the whole cell lysate, binding of SIRT7 to the chromatin and other proteins for performing deacetylation and desuccinylation activity.",Chromatin fractionation; DNA damage response; Deacetylation and desuccinylation assay; Immunoprecipitation; SIRT7.
665,On the Proof of Fixed-Point Convergence for Plug-and-Play ADMM,"Gavaskar, Ruturaj Girish; Chaudhury, Kunal Nara","In most state-of-the-art image restoration methods, the sum of a data-fidelity and a regularization term is optimized using an iterative algorithm such as ADMM (alternating direction method of multipliers). In recent years, the possibility of using denoisers for regularization has been explored in several works. A popular approach is to formally replace the proximal operator within the ADMM framework with some powerful denoiser. However, since most state-of-the-art denoisers cannot be posed as a proximal operator, one cannot guarantee the convergence of these so-called plug-and-play (PnP) algorithms. In fact, the theoretical convergence of PnP algorithms is an active research topic. In this letter, we consider the result of Chan et al. (IEEE TCI, 2017), where fixed-point convergence of an ADMM-based PnP algorithm was established for a class of denoisers. We argue that the original proof is incomplete, since convergence is not analyzed for one of the three possible cases outlined in the letter. Moreover, we explain why the argument for the other cases does not apply in this case. We give a different analysis to fill this gap, which firmly establishes the original convergence theorem.",Regularization; plug-and-play; ADMM; convergence analysis

Sediment and bivalves were collected from 50 locations along the Korean coast to assess the geographical distribution, sources, and bioaccumulation potential of siloxanes. Cyclic and linear siloxanes were detectable in all sediment and bivalve samples. The highest siloxane concentrations were detected in sediment (656 ng/g dw) and bivalves (3273 ng/g dw) from highly industrialized bays and harbor-zones, suggesting that industrial and shipping activities are major sources of siloxanes in coastal environment. The geographical distribution of siloxanes was similar in sediment and bivalves. Sedimentary siloxanes were dominated by cyclic siloxanes, while linear siloxanes were predominant in bivalves. Bioaccumulation of linear siloxanes in bivalves originated mainly from the sedimentary environment. Mean biota-sediment accumulation factors (BSAFs) of seven siloxanes ranged from 1.26 to 6.03, indicating potential for bioaccumulation.

Many existing reconstruction algorithms require a set of good seed points. 3D neuron critical points, including terminations, branch points and cross-over points, are good candidates for such seed points. However, a method that can simultaneously detect all types of critical points has barely been explored. In this work, we present a method to simultaneously detect all 3 types of 3D critical points in neuron microscopy images, based on a spherical-patches extraction (SPE) method and a 2D multi-stream convolutional neural network (CNN). SPE uses a set of concentric spherical surfaces centered at a given critical point candidate to extract intensity distribution features around the point. Then, a group of 2D spherical patches is generated by projecting the surfaces into 2D rectangular image patches according to the orders of the azimuth and the polar angles. Finally, a 2D multi-stream CNN, in which each stream receives one spherical patch as input, is designed to learn the intensity distribution features from those spherical patches and classify the given critical point candidate into one of four classes: termination, branch point, cross-over point or non-critical point. Experimental results confirm that the proposed method outperforms other state-of-the-art critical points detection methods.

From a computer science perspective, IoMusT refers to the networks of computing devices embedded in physical objects (musical things) dedicated to the production and/or reception of musical content. Musical things, such as smart musical instruments or wearables, are connected by an infrastructure that enables multidirectional communication, both locally and remotely. We present a vision in which the IoMusT enables the connection of digital and physical domains by means of appropriate information and communication technologies, fostering novel musical applications and services. The ecosystems associated with the IoMusT include interoperable devices and services that connect musicians and audiences to support musician-musician, audience-musicians, and audience-audience interactions. In this paper, we first propose a vision for the IoMusT and its motivations. We then discuss five scenarios illustrating how the IoMusT could support: 1) augmented and immersive concert experiences; 2) audience participation; 3) remote rehearsals; 4) music e-learning; and 5) smart studio production. We identify key capabilities missing from today's systems and discuss the research needed to develop these capabilities across a set of interdisciplinary challenges. These encompass network communication (e.g., ultra-low latency and security), music information research (e.g., artificial intelligence for real-time audio content description and multimodal sensing), music interaction (e.g., distributed performance and music e-learning), as well as legal and responsible innovation aspects to ensure that future IoMusT services are socially desirable and undertaken in the public interest.",Internet of Things; sound and music computing; ubiquitous music; mobile music; networked music performance; participatory art

671,Multi-source information art painting fusion interactive 3D dynamic scene virtual reality technology application research,"Pan, JunHong; Deng, Xi","Art painting is a very important major in China's education system. Under the background of the new era, the country vigorously promotes the modernization of education and the development of intelligence. Many subjects of teaching have been more mature and carried out intelligent teaching based on virtual reality technology. But throughout the art painting profession, the research on this aspect is almost blank. The main reason is that there are deep academic barriers between art painting and computer science. Therefore, this paper puts forward the application research of multi-source information art painting fusion interactive 3D dynamic scene virtual reality technology. This paper deeply analyzes the needs of art painting and its teaching reform and believes that the existing virtual reality technology cannot adapt to the teaching environment of art painting. In view of the possible inaccurate calculation and other problems, this paper puts forward the optimization scheme. The core of the scheme is to use the information integration advantages of multi-source information fusion to provide more comprehensive and complete object information for 3D modeling of virtual reality technology, so as to improve the imaging quality of virtual reality technology. In order to meet the requirement of high precision, the calculation method is optimized, the calculation steps are simplified, and the sensor selection is optimized again. This paper introduces the design principle and operation steps of the optimization method in detail. In order to further verify the actual effect of this method, comparative analysis method is used to test the comprehensive performance. In order to ensure the test quality, the median filtering algorithm and fuzzy algorithm are compared. Through the analysis and comparison of the data, the optimization method in this paper greatly improves the accuracy of calculation and the comprehensive performance is improved.",art painting; intelligent teaching; multi-source information fusion; virtual reality technology

In this paper, we propose a novel Voting-based Adaptive Feature Fusion multi-task network (VAFF-Net) for joint segmentation, detection, and classification of RV, FAZ, and RVJ in optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA). A task-specific voting gate module is proposed to adaptively extract and fuse different features for specific tasks at two levels: features at different spatial positions from a single encoder, and features from multiple encoders. In particular, since the complexity of the microvasculature in OCTA images makes simultaneous precise localization and classification of retinal vascular junctions into bifurcation/crossing a challenging task, we specifically design a task head by combining the heatmap regression and grid classification. We take advantage of three different en face angiograms from various retinal layers, rather than following existing methods that use only a single en face. We carry out extensive experiments on three OCTA datasets acquired using different imaging devices, and the results demonstrate that the proposed method performs on the whole better than either the state-of-the-art single-purpose methods or existing multi-task learning solutions. We also demonstrate that our multi-task learning method generalizes across other imaging modalities, such as color fundus photography, and may potentially be used as a general multi-task learning tool. We also construct three datasets for multiple structure detection, and part of these datasets with the source code and evaluation benchmark have been released for public access.",OCTA; multi-task learning; retina structures; detection; segmentation; classification

It is often asymptomatic; however, it can be expressed by several complications, including infection, adnexal torsion, and rupture. Rarely ovarian dermoid cysts can also transform into malignant degeneration. A ruptured teratoma is a rare and life-threatening complication and may arise spontaneously. However, cystic rupture is often secondary to surgical procedures such as ovarian cystectomy, leading to acute peritonitis and surgical emergency. Herein, we report a case of acute peritonitis in a female resulting from ovarian dermoid cyst spillage.

Second, a dynamic power framework is presented that was developed in the context of research on socio-technical sustainability transitions, including the basics of this power framework as well as some empirical illustrations. Third, it is discussed how the presented power framework deals with time, change and long-term dynamics, and how this contributes to the state-of-the-art.

We have developed a set of representative distributed machine learning algorithms in TuX(2), covering both supervised and unsupervised learning. Compared to the implementations on distributed machine learning platforms, writing those algorithms in TuX(2) takes only about 25 percent of the code: our graph computation model hides the detailed management of data layout, partitioning, and parallelism from developers. The extensive evaluation of TuX(2), using large datasets with up to 64 billion of edges, shows that TuX(2) outperforms PowerGraph/PowerLyra, the state-of-the-art distributed graph engines, by an order of magnitude, while beating two state-of-the-art distributed machine learning systems by at least 60 percent.",Graph computing; distributed machine learning; heterogeneity; stale synchronous parallel; MEGA model
679,Towards Deploying DNN Models on Edge for Predictive Maintenance Applications,"Pandey, Rick; Uziel, Sebastian; Hutschenreuther, Tino; Krug, Silvia","Almost all rotating machinery in the industry has bearings as their key building block and most of these machines run 24 x 7. This makes bearing health prediction an active research area for predictive maintenance solutions. Many state of the art Deep Neural Network (DNN) models have been proposed to solve this. However, most of these high performance models are computationally expensive and have high memory requirements. This limits their use to very specific industrial applications with powerful hardwares deployed close the the machinery. In order to bring DNN-based solutions to a potential use in the industry, we need to deploy these models on Microcontroller Units (MCUs) which are cost effective and energy efficient. However, this step is typically neglected in literature as it poses new challenges. The primary concern when inferencing the DNN models on MCUs is the on chip memory of the MCU that has to fit the model, the data and additional code to run the system. Almost all the state of the art models fail this litmus test since they feature too many parameters. In this paper, we show the challenges related to the deployment, review possible solutions and evaluate one of them showing how the deployment can be realized and what steps are needed. The focus is on the steps required for the actual deployment rather than finding the optimal solution. This paper is among the first to show the deployment on MCUs for a predictive maintenance use case. We first analyze the gap between State Of The Art benchmark DNN models for bearing defect classification and the memory constraint of two MCU variants. Additionally, we review options to reduce the model size such as pruning and quantization. Afterwards, we evaluate a solution to deploy the DNN models by pruning them in order to fit them into microcontrollers. Our results show that most models under test can be reduced to fit MCU memory for a maximum loss of 3% in average accuracy of the pruned models in comparison to the original models. Based on the results, we also discuss which methods are promising and which combination of model and feature work best for the given classification problem.",predictive maintenance; artificial intelligence (AI); embedded AI; edge AI; pruning; model deployment

Characteristics such as ground sampling distance, resolution, number of bands and the information these bands convey are the keys to its accuracy. Random Forest is the most widely used approach but better and more modern alternatives do exist. In this paper, state-of-the-art methods are evaluated, consisting of semantic segmentation networks such as UNet and DeepLabV3+. In addition, two datasets based on aircraft and satellite imagery are generated as a new state of the art to test land use classification. These datasets, called UOPNOA and UOS2, are publicly available. In this work, the performance of these networks and the two datasets generated are evaluated. This paper demonstrates that ground sampling distance is the most important factor in obtaining good semantic segmentation results, but a suitable number of bands can be as important. This proves that both aircraft and satellite imagery can produce good results, although for different reasons. Finally, cost performance for an inference prototype is evaluated, comparing various Microsoft Azure architectures. The evaluation concludes that using a GPU is unnecessarily costly for deployment.

Although there are many advances in knowledge, much remains to be investigated concerning many species considered ""minor"", that is, camels and dromedaries. Dromedaries, recently, have attracted the interest of some breeders following the results of studies concerning the nutritional and therapeutic properties of their products - milk in particular - that make them ideal for some particular categories of consumers, such as diabetics, obesity sufferers, lactose-intolerant subjects, menopausal women and so on. Considering their use in dairy husbandry, dromedaries are reared under intensive and/or semi-intensive systems with the resulting emergence of specific needs, which should be fulfilled in order to have appropriate welfare.

Despite the higher difficulty to circumvent them, nowadays criminals are developing techniques to accurately simulate physical, physiological, and behavioral traits of valid users, process known as spoofing attack. In this context, robust countermeasure methods must be developed and integrated with the traditional biometric applications in order to prevent such frauds. Despite face being a promising trait due to its convenience and acceptability, face recognition systems can be easily fooled with common printed photographs. Most of state-of-the-art antispoofing techniques for face recognition applications extract handcrafted texture features from images, mainly based on the efficient local binary patterns (LBP) descriptor, to characterize them. However, recent results indicate that high-level (deep) features are more robust for such complex tasks. In this brief, a novel approach for face spoofing detection that extracts deep texture features from images by integrating the LBP descriptor to a modified convolutional neural network is proposed. Experiments on the NUAA spoofing database indicate that such deep neural network (called LBPnet) and an extended version of it (n-LBPnet) outperform other state-of-the-art techniques, presenting great results in terms of attack detection.",Face recognition; spoofing detection; biometrics; deep texture features; convolutional neural networks

This paper presents a novel probabilistic 3D scene model that integrates state-of-the-art multiclass object detection, object tracking and scene labeling together with geometric 3D reasoning. Our model is able to represent complex object interactions such as inter-object occlusion, physical exclusion between objects, and geometric context. Inference in this model allows us to jointly recover the 3D scene context and perform 3D multi-object tracking from a mobile observer, for objects of multiple categories, using only monocular video as input. Contrary to many other approaches, our system performs explicit occlusion reasoning and is therefore capable of tracking objects that are partially occluded for extended periods of time, or objects that have never been observed to their full extent. In addition, we show that a joint scene tracklet model for the evidence collected over multiple frames substantially improves performance. The approach is evaluated for different types of challenging onboard sequences. We first show a substantial improvement to the state of the art in 3D multipeople tracking.

This paper aims to statistically analyze the dynamic nature of FC by representing the collective time-series data, over a set of brain regions, as a trajectory on the space of covariance matrices, or symmetric-positive definite matrices (SPDMs). We use a recently developed metric on the space of SPDMs for quantifying differences across FC observations, and for clustering and classification of FC trajectories. To facilitate large scale and high-dimensional data analysis, we propose a novel, metric-based dimensionality reduction technique to reduce data from large SPDMs to small SPDMs. We illustrate this comprehensive framework using data from the Human Connectome Project (HCP) database for multiple subjects and tasks, with task classification rates that match or outperform state-of-the-art techniques.",Trajectory; Covariance matrices; Measurement; Functional magnetic resonance imaging; Task analysis; Time series analysis; Symmetric matrices; Dynamic functional connectivity; fMRI pattern classification; covariance trajectory; Riemmanian metric; dimension reduction

Then, we built a multi-scale feature pyramid through an improved feature pyramid network (FPN) and integrated multi-level feature information. Finally, the small full convolutional network (FCN) was used as the classification subnet and the bounding box regression subnet. The Kullback-Leibler (KL) loss replaced smooth L1 loss as a bounding box regression loss function for learning bounding box regression and positioning uncertainty at the same time.

691,Local Phase Velocity Based Imaging: A New Technique Used for Ultrasound Shear Wave Elastography,"Kijanka, Piotr; Urban, Matthew W.","Ultrasound shear wave elastography is an imaging modality for noninvasive evaluation of tissue mechanical properties. However, many current techniques overestimate lesions dimension or shape especially when small inclusions are taken into account. In this paper, we propose a new method called local phase velocity-based imaging (LPVI) as an alternative technique to measure tissue elasticity. Two separate acquisitions with ultrasound push beams focused once on the left side and once on the right side of the inclusion were generated. A local shear wave velocity is then recovered in the frequency domain (for a single frequency or frequency band) for both acquired data sets. Finally, a two-dimensional shear wave velocity map is reconstructed by combining maps from two separate acquisitions. Robust and accurate shear wave velocity maps are reconstructed using the proposed LPVI method in calibrated liver fibrosis tissue mimicking homogeneous phantoms, a calibrated elastography phantom with stepped cylinder inclusions and a homemade gelatin phantom with ex vivo porcine liver inclusion. Results are compared with an existing phase velocity-based imaging approach and a group velocity-based method considered as the state of the art. Results from the phantom study showed that increased frequency improved the shape of the reconstructed inclusions and contrast-to-noise ratio between the target and background.",Shear wave elastography (SWE); ultrasound; soft tissue; local wavenumber; phantom; lesion; imaging

In this work, we address these three challenges with a multi-task learning approach that combines the classification of placental location (e.g., anterior, posterior) and semantic placenta segmentation in a single convolutional neural network. Through the classification task the model can learn from larger and more diverse datasets while improving the accuracy of the segmentation task in particular in limited training set conditions. With this approach we investigate the variability in annotations from multiple raters and show that our automatic segmentations (Dice of 0.86 for anterior and 0.83 for posterior placentas) achieve human-level performance as compared to intra- and inter-observer variability. Lastly, our approach can deliver whole placenta segmentation using a multi-view US acquisition pipeline consisting of three stages: multi-probe image acquisition, image fusion and image segmentation.

The study included patients with established BE of any extent who had a diagnosis of IND accompanied by concurrent p53 immunohistochemistry (IHC) stain at the index endoscopic procedure and at least one follow-up examination between 2000 and 2021. Correlation between disease progression from IND to higher-grade dysplasia [low-grade dysplasia (LGD), high-grade dysplasia (HGD) and oesophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC)] and clinicopathological parameters were analysed. A total of 149 patients (99 males; mean age 63.3 ± 10.0 years, range = 35-89) were included in the final analysis. Median follow-up was 37.1 months [interquartile range (IQR) = 20.5-59.1 months]. Progression rates from IND to LGD and HGD were 12.1% (18 of 149) and 2.7% (four of 149), respectively. On multivariate analysis, the number of IND diagnoses was significantly associated with progression to both LGD and HGD (P = 0.016 and P < 0.001, respectively). Cox regression analysis showed that aberrant p53 expression was significantly associated with progression to LGD [hazard ratio (HR) = 4.87, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.91-12.45, P = 0.001] and HGD (HR = 21.81, 95% CI = 1.88-253.70, P = 0.014). Kaplan-Meier survival analysis also demonstrated that aberrant p53 expression was significantly associated with progression to LGD (P < 0.001) and HGD (P = 0.001). Our results suggest that frequency of IND diagnoses and status of p53 expression can help to stratify risk of neoplastic progression in BE patients with IND.",Barrett oesophagus; high-grade dysplasia; indefinite for dysplasia; low-grade dysplasia; oesophageal adenocarcinoma; p53.
694,3D Sound Coding Color for the Visually Impaired,"Lee, Yong; Lee, Chung-Heon; Cho, Jun Dong","Contemporary art is evolving beyond simply looking at works, and the development of various sensory technologies has had a great influence on culture and art. Accordingly, opportunities for the visually impaired to appreciate visual artworks through various senses such as auditory and tactile senses are expanding. However, insufficient sound expression and lack of portability make it less understandable and accessible. This paper attempts to convey a color and depth coding scheme to the visually impaired, based on alternative sensory modalities, such as hearing (by encoding the color and depth information with 3D sounds of audio description) and touch (to be used for interface-triggering information such as color and depth). The proposed color-coding scheme represents light, saturated, and dark colors for red, orange, yellow, yellow-green, green, blue-green, blue, and purple. The paper's proposed system can be used for both mobile platforms and 2.5D (relief) models.",visual impairment; accessibility; aesthetics; color; multi-sensory; museum exhibits

Twin-cup dosemeters with LR-115 (II) nuclear track detectors were used in this study. The findings show that values vary significantly, with winter having the highest values and summer having the lowest, with spring and autumn having moderate values. In winter, radon concentrations range from 61.6 ± 11.2 Bq m-3 (Mud) to 115.3 ± 34.3 Bq m-3 (AT), with geometric mean values of 69.2 ± 13.8 Bq m-3 and 109.4 ± 27.9 Bq m-3, and in summer, they range from 21.1 ± 5.9 Bq m-3 (Mud) to 28.4 ± 8.3 Bq m-3 (AT), with geometric mean values of 22.7 ± 6.3 Bq m-3 and 26.1 ± 7.1 Bq m-3, whereas thoron concentrations range from 13.1 ± 5.1 Bq m-3 (Mud) to 58.8 ± 12.6 Bq m-3 (AT), with geometric mean values of 27.6 ± 7.0 Bq m-3 and 52.9 ± 10.1 Bq m-3 in winter, respectively, and in summer, from 8.8 ± 2.3 Bq m-3 (Mud) to 13.0 ± 5.5 Bq m-3 (Mud), with a geometric mean value of 1.87 ± 1.29 Bq m-3. Radon and thoron progeny levels are reported to vary from 4.1 ± 0.3 mWL (Mud) to 15.1 ± 4.3 mWL (AT) and 2.6 ± 0.9 mWL (Mud) to 14.3 ± 4.2 mWL (AT) in winter and from 1.5 ± 0.7 mWL (AT) to 3.0 ± 2.5 mWL (Mud) and 0.9 ± 0.3 mWL (AT) to 2.7 ± 0.5 mWL (Mud) in summer, respectively. The equilibrium factors for radon and its progeny have been reported to range from 0.23 ± 0.1 (Mud) to 0.51 ± 0.3 (AT) in winter, whereas from 0.23 ± 0.1 (AT) to 0.48 ± 0.4 (Mud) in summer, respectively. The equilibrium factors for thoron and its progeny have been estimated in the range of 0.02 ± 0.01 (Mud) to 0.09 ± 0.06 (AT) in winter, whereas 0.02 ± 0.02 (AT) to 0.07 ± 0.05 (Mud) in summer, respectively. The inhalation dose rates differed from house to house, having values in the range of 1.2 ± 0.2 mSv year-1 (Mud) to 4.6 ± 1.3 mSv year-1 (AT) in winter, whereas 0.5 ± 0.3 mSv year-1 (AT) to 0.9 ± 0.5 mSv year-1 (Mud) in summer, respectively. The effective doses (EDs) due to the exposure of radon and thoron in the study area have been found to range from 2.5 ± 0.3 mSv (Mud) to 9.1 ± 2.7 mSv (AT) in winter and 0.9 ± 0.4 mSv (AT) to 1.8 ± 1.3 mSv (Mud) in summer, respectively. The levels of radon and thoron in similar types of construction were found to be significantly different from one house to another. The estimated radon and thoron concentrations in the houses of that region during winter are found to be substantially higher than the global averages as reported by UNSCEAR.",Effective dose; Effective radium content; Inhalation dose; LR-115 (II) detectors; Radon; Thoron.

Many experimental studies have reported the toxicity of long-term administration of ASP in various organ tissues. However, there is little evidence available about the nature and mechanisms of the adverse effects of long-term consumption of ASP on the cardiovascular system. This study was conducted to evaluate the possible effects of ASP on heart tissue. For this study 36 mature male mice were divided into one control group and three groups which received respectively 40 mg/kg, 80 mg/kg and 160 mg/kg ASP orally, for 90 days. ASP at the doses of 80 and 160 mg/kg increased the serum content of malondialdehyde (MDA), but decreased serum nitric oxide (NO), creatine kinase (CK) and CK-MB, as well as blood superoxide dismutase (SOD) levels. Serum level of total anti-oxidant capacity (TAC) in blood was also reduced in serum at the dose of 80 mg/kg. Histochemical staining, including Periodic acid-Schiff, Masson's trichrome and Verhoeff-van Gieson staining, indicated that ASP at doses of 80 and 160 mg/kg reduced glycogen deposition and decreased the number of collagen and elastic fibres in the cardiac tissue. The cardiac expression of pro-apoptotic genes, including P53, Bax, Bcl-2 and Caspase-3, was modulated at the dose of 160 mg/kg. Moreover, transcription of Caspase-3 was up-regulated at the dose of 80 mg/kg. In conclusion, long-term consumption of ASP any higher than the acceptable daily intake (40 mg/kg) appears to act by promoting oxidative stress, has the potential to alter both histopathological and biochemical parameters, and induces P53-dependent apoptosis in cardiac tissue.",aspartame; heart; mice; non-nutritive sweeteners; oxidative stress; toxicity.
698,Video Synchronization With Bit-Rate Signals and Correntropy Function,"Pereira, Igor; Silveira, Luiz F.; Goncalves, Luiz","We propose an approach for the synchronization of video streams using correntropy. Essentially, the time offset is calculated on the basis of the instantaneous transfer rates of the video streams that are extracted in the form of a univariate signal known as variable bit-rate (VBR). The state-of-the-art approach uses a window segmentation strategy that is based on consensual zero-mean normalized cross-correlation (ZNCC). This strategy has an elevated computational complexity, making its application to synchronizing online data streaming difficult. Hence, our proposal uses a different window strategy that, together with the correntropy function, allows the synchronization to be performed for online applications. This provides equivalent synchronization scores with a rapid offset determination as the streams come into the system. The efficiency of our approach has been verified through experiments that demonstrate its viability with values that are as precise as those obtained by ZNCC. The proposed approach scored 81% in time reference classification against the equivalent 81% of the state-of-the-art approach, requiring much less computational power.",correntropy; variable bit-rate; video synchronization

Although many previous studies have examined activities of GS, the effect of GS on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammatory responses in mouse inner medullary collecting duct-3 (mIMCD-3) cells have not been examined. Therefore, here, we investigated the anti-inflammatory action of GS on mIMCD-3 cells exposed to LPS. LPS treatment on mIMCD-3 cells produced pro-inflammatory molecules such as inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) significantly; however, GS treatment significantly inhibited the production of pro-inflammatory molecules. In addition, GS inhibited the degradation of Iκ-Bα and translocation of NF-κB on mIMCD-3 cells. These results suggest that GS could inhibit inflammatory responses in collecting duct cells which could contribute to kidney injury during systemic infection.",guggulsterone (GS); inflammation; inner medullary collecting duct (IMCD); lipopolysaccharide (LPS); toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4).
700,Robust segmentation of the colour image by fusing the SDD clustering results from different colour spaces,"Wang, Zhenzhou","Segmentation of the colour image is challenging because the colour information is lost after being projected into three channels of the colour space. Many state-of-the-art colour image segmentation methods are based on monochrome segmentation in one channel of the colour space. However, the optimal performance of a segmentation method usually could not be achieved in a single colour space due to the complexity and diversity of the colour images. In this study, the authors propose to segment the colour image by fusing the slope difference distribution (SDD) clustering results in different colour spaces. For simplicity, the segmentation approach is designed as two-label segmentation and it could be easily generalised to be multiple-label segmentation. The proposed approach is compared with the state-of-the-art colour image segmentation methods both quantitatively and qualitatively. Experimental results verified the effectiveness of the proposed approach.",image colour analysis; image segmentation; pattern clustering; image fusion; single colour space; two-label segmentation; multiple-label segmentation; robust segmentation; colour information; monochrome segmentation; slope difference distribution clustering; colour image segmentation methods; SDD clustering; colour image complexity; colour image diversity
701,Attacks on state-of-the-art face recognition using attentional adversarial attack generative network,"Yang, Lu; Song, Qing; Wu, Yingqi","With the broad use of face recognition, its weakness gradually emerges that it is able to be attacked. Therefore, it is very important to study how face recognition networks are subject to attacks. Generating adversarial examples is an effective attack method, which misleads the face recognition system through obfuscation attack (rejecting a genuine subject) or impersonation attack (matching to an impostor). In this paper, we introduce a novel GAN, Attentional Adversarial Attack Generative Network (A(3)GN), to generate adversarial examples that mislead the network to identify someone as the target person not misclassify inconspicuously. For capturing the geometric and context information of the target person, this work adds a conditional variational autoencoder and attention modules to learn the instance-level correspondences between faces. Unlike traditional two-player GAN, this work introduces a face recognition network as the third player to participate in the competition between generator and discriminator which allows the attacker to impersonate the target person better. The generated faces which are hard to arouse the notice of onlookers can evade recognition by state-of-the-art networks and most of them are recognized as the target person.",Face recognition; Generative adversarial networks; Adversarial attack

All that is needed is to convolve the input image with this template with additional post-processing. Experiments show that our model is extremely fast and performs better than state-of-the-art models in human eye fixation prediction.",Visual attention; Saliency; Receptive field; Filter

704,Improving Large-Scale Image Retrieval Through Robust Aggregation of Local Descriptors,"Husain, Syed Sameed; Bober, Miroslaw","Visual search and image retrieval underpin numerous applications, however the task is still challenging predominantly due to the variability of object appearance and ever increasing size of the databases, often exceeding billions of images. Prior art methods rely on aggregation of local scale-invariant descriptors, such as SIFT, via mechanisms including Bag of Visual Words (BoW), Vector of Locally Aggregated Descriptors (VLAD) and Fisher Vectors (FV). However, their performance is still short of what is required. This paper presents a novel method for deriving a compact and distinctive representation of image content called Robust Visual Descriptor with Whitening (RVD-W). It significantly advances the state of the art and delivers world-class performance. In our approach local descriptors are rank-assigned to multiple clusters. Residual vectors are then computed in each cluster, normalized using a direction-preserving normalization function and aggregated based on the neighborhood rank. Importantly, the residual vectors are de-correlated and whitened in each cluster before aggregation, leading to a balanced energy distribution in each dimension and significantly improved performance. We also propose a new post-PCA normalization approach which improves separability between the matching and non-matching global descriptors. This new normalization benefits not only our RVD-W descriptor but also improves existing approaches based on FV and VLAD aggregation. Furthermore, we show that the aggregation framework developed using hand-crafted SIFT features also performs exceptionally well with Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based features. The RVD-W pipeline outperforms state-of-the-art global descriptors on both the Holidays and Oxford datasets. On the large scale datasets, Holidays1M and Oxford1M, SIFT-based RVD-W representation obtains a mAP of 45.1 and 35.1 percent, while CNN-based RVD-W achieve a mAP of 63.5 and 44.8 percent, all yielding superior performance to the state-of-the-art.",Visual search; image retrieval; local descriptor aggregation; global descriptor

Of all defects, cell-level anomalies can lead to serious failures and may affect surrounding PV modules in the long run. These fine defects are usually captured with high spatial resolution electroluminescence (EL) imaging. The difficulty of acquiring such images has limited the availability of data. For this work, multiple data resources and augmentation techniques have been used to surpass this limitation. Current state-of-the-art detection methods extract barely low-level information from individual PV cell images, and their performance is conditioned by the available training data. In this article, we propose an end-to-end deep learning pipeline that detects, locates and segments cell-level anomalies from entire photovoltaic modules via EL images. The proposed modular pipeline combines three deep learning techniques: 1. object detection (modified Faster-RNN), 2. image classification (EfficientNet) and 3. weakly supervised segmentation (autoencoder). The modular nature of the pipeline allows to upgrade the deep learning models to the further improvements in the state-of-the-art and also extend the pipeline towards new functionalities.",Electroluminescence images; Photovoltaic modules; Deep learning; Anomaly detection; Weakly supervised segmentation; Deep autoencoder

However, the translation of this new knowledge to advance periodontal therapeutics is minimal. We contend that novel clinical interventions directed beyond conventional therapies need to be emphasized. A clear understanding of the structural and functional dynamics of subgingival microbiota is a pre-requisite for developing any microbiome-based interventions for applications in periodontal health care.

However, not all aspects have been yet explored among different types of malocclusion. The maxillary anterior alveolus is one of the components of the maxillary bone which affects the upper lip position and the esthetics of the smile. The inclination of this alveolus may vary between the different vertical growth patterns of patients who may seek orthodontic treatment. The objective of this study was to investigate possible differences in maxillary anterior alveolar angle (MAAA) among orthodontically untreated adults with different vertical facial types in a Syrian sample. Methods CBCT images of 84 orthodontically untreated adult patients were included. Three groups of vertical facial type (n=28 for each group; 14 males, 14 females) were created using disproportionate multi-stratified random sampling. CBCT-derived lateral cephalograms were used to categorize the patients into three groups. Measurements were made at three regions (region 1 (R1), region 2 (R2), and region 3 (R3)), located in the maxillary anterior alveolar bone using OnDemand3D™ software (Cypermed Inc., Seoul, South Korea). Results No significant differences in the mean MAAA were detected between females and males for the three measured regions in all groups. Analysis of variance showed significant inter-group differences in the MAAA (p<0.05) for all measured regions. The hyperdivergent facial type group had the greatest MAAA mean value of 68.72° (± 6.01), 67.30° (± 4.15), and 68.01° (± 5.12) at R1 in the female, male, and the entire sample of both sexes respectively. Whereas the hypodivergent facial type group had the least mean MAAA values of 58.47° (± 5.34) at R3, 59.83° (± 6.23) at R2, and 59.23° (± 5.75) at R3 in the female, male, and the entire sample of both sexes respectively. Conclusions The maxillary anterior alveolar bone was more buccally inclined in the hypodivergent facial type. The MAA bone inclination did not differ between females and males in the same vertical facial type group.",cbct; hyperdivergent; hypodivergent; maxillary anterior alveolar angle; normodivergent; vertical facial type.
710,Deep metric learning for image retrieval in smart city development,"Liu, Qi; Li, Wenhan; Chen, Zhiyuan; Hua, Bin","Deep metric learning (DML) aims to learn a consistent distance embedding where an anchor is closer within the same category than others. It underpins a variety of essential and significant tasks in the development of smart city including face recognition, landmark retrieval, pedestrian detection, person/vehicle re-identification, and so on. Traditional pair-based DML methods try to make full use of the data-to-data relations within a (mini-)batch, but they cannot grasp the data distribution information due to the batch size limitation. On the other hand, proxy-based DML schemes use different proxies to approximate the data distribution. However, the proxies are too sample to represent the intra-category variance. In this paper, we propose a simple but effective method, named soft-instance-label proxy, for embedding learning. It can capture the globe data distribution information while depicting the detailed intra-class data structure. The state-of-the-art empirical results on three public image retrieval benchmarks and two backbone networks demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method. Our Softinstance-label proxy method can have a Recall@1 improvement of 2.4% with Googlenet, largely surpassing the current state-of-art-methods while demonstrating great potential in the development of smart city.",Smart city; Image retrieval; Deep metric learning

Therefore, regional soil characteristics should be considered in the process of regionalization for environmental management. However, no comprehensive evaluation or systematic classification of the natural soil environment has been established for China. Here, we established an index system for natural soil environmental regionalization (NSER) by combining literature data obtained based on bibliometrics with the analytic hierarchy process (AHP). Based on the index system, we collected spatial distribution data for 14 indexes at the national scale. In addition, three clustering algorithms-self-organizing feature mapping (SOFM), fuzzy c-means (FCM) and k-means (KM)-were used to classify and define the natural soil environment. We imported four cluster validity indexes (CVI) to evaluate different models: Davies-Bouldin index (DB), Silhouette index (Sil) and Calinski-Harabasz index (CH) for FCM and KM, clustering quality index (CQI) for SOFM. Analysis and comparison of the results showed that when the number of clusters was 13, the FCM clustering algorithm achieved the optimal clustering results (DB = 1.16, Sil = 0.78, CH = 6.77 × 106), allowing the natural soil environment of China to be divided into 12 regions with distinct characteristics.

712,Assessing genetic and agronomic gains in rice yield in sub-Saharan Africa: A meta-analysis,"Ali Ibrahim,Kazuki Saito,Ali Ibrahim,Kazuki Saito","Research for development efforts for increasing rice yield in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) have largely concentrated on genetic improvement and agronomy for more than 50 years. Here we perform the first meta-analysis to quantify genetic gain - yield increase through use of new variety and calculated by yield difference between new variety and variety popularly grown in the target site, and agronomic gain - difference in yield between improved agronomic practices and the control in SSA using 208 paired observations from 40 studies across 12 countries. Among the studies, 41 %, 34 %, and 25 % were from irrigated lowland, rainfed lowland, and rainfed upland rice, respectively. Seventy percent of the studies reported in this paper were conducted on research stations. In agronomic practices, inorganic fertilizer management practices accounted for 78 % of the studies, of which 48 % were nitrogen (N) management. In each study, we identified four types of varieties: check variety (VC), variety with highest yield in the control (VHC), variety with highest yield under improved agronomic practices (VHT), and variety with largest yield difference between improved agronomic practices and control (VHR). VHT was the same as VHC in 35 % of observations, whereas VHR and VHT were the same in 51 %. These indicate that it is possible to develop varieties adapted to different agronomic practices and high-yielding varieties tend to be responsive to improved agronomic practices. On average, total gain in yield with improved agronomic practices and VHT was 1.6 t/ha. Agronomic practice accounted for 75 % of the total variation in total yield gain with variety and agronomic practice by variety interaction responsible for 19 % and 6 %, respectively. Genetic gains in yield with VHC, VHT, and VHR were 0.7, 0.3, and -0.3 t/ha in control, and 0.4, 0.9, and 0.5 t/ha in improved agronomic practices. Agronomic gain in yield averaged 0.5, 0.8, 1.4, and 1.6 t/ha in VHC, VC, VHT, and VHR, respectively. Agronomic gain in yield of VHT was higher than genetic gain under improved agronomic practices in 54 % of observations. Agronomic gain was highest in irrigated lowland rice, followed by rainfed lowland rice. Higher agronomic gain in yield was also associated with larger difference in N application rate between improved agronomic practices and control. Whereas agronomic practices had larger contribution to total gain in yield than genetic improvement in this study, future assessment of agronomic and genetic gains in yield is warranted. Such assessment should focus more on rainfed rice systems, where agronomic gain was small, take into account genetic improvement rate over time and integrated agronomic practices rather than single intervention like nutrient management practice only, and be conducted in farmers' fields.",Agronomy; Genetic improvement; Meta-analysis; Oryza spp.

714,SNPSFuzzer: A Fast Greybox Fuzzer for Stateful Network Protocols Using Snapshots,"Li, Junqiang; Li, Senyi; Sun, Gang; Chen, Ting; Yu, Hongfang","Greybox fuzzing has been widely used in stateless programs and has achieved great success. However, most state-of-the-art greybox fuzzers have slow speed and shallow state depth coverage in fuzzing stateful network protocol programs, which are able to remember and store the details of interactions. The existing greybox fuzzers for network protocol programs first send a series of well-defined prefix sequences of input messages and then send mutated messages to test the target state of a stateful network protocol. This process leads to a high time cost. In this paper, we propose SNPSFuzzer, a fast greybox fuzzer for stateful network protocols using snapshots. SNPSFuzzer dumps the context information when the network protocol program is in a specific state and restores it when the state needs to be fuzzed. Furthermore, we design a message chain analysis algorithm to explore more and deeper network protocol states. Our evaluation shows that compared with the state-of-the-art network protocol greybox fuzzer AFLNET, SNPSFuzzer improves the message processing speed of network protocol fuzzing by 70.7% and increases the path coverage by 20.9% on average within 24 hours. Moreover, SNPSFuzzer exposes a previously unreported vulnerability in the program Tinydtls.",Protocols; Fuzzing; Sockets; Electronic mail; Libraries; XML; Sun; Greybox fuzzing; stateful network protocol programs; snapshots
715,Recognition of English calling cards by using enhanced fuzzy radial basis function neural networks,"Kim, KB; Kim, YJ","In this paper, we proposed the novel method for the recognition of English calling cards by using the contour tracking algorithm and the enhanced fuzzy RBF (Radial Basis Function) neural networks. The recognition of calling cards consists of the extraction phase of character areas and the recognition phase of extracted characters. In the extraction phase, first of all, noises are removed from the images of calling cards, and the feature areas including character strings are separated from the calling card images by using the horizontal smearing method and the 8-directional contour tracking method. And using the image projection method the feature areas are split into the areas of individual characters. We also proposed the enhanced fuzzy RBF neural network that organizes the middle layer effectively by using the enhanced fuzzy ART neural network adjusting the vigilance parameter dynamically according to the similarity between patterns. In the recognition phase, the proposed fuzzy neural network was applied to recognize individual characters. Our experiment result showed that the proposed recognition algorithm has higher success rate of recognition and faster learning time than the conventional RBF network based recognitions.",English calling cards; enhanced fuzzy RBF (radial basis function); neural networks; 8-directional contour tracking method; enhanced fuzzy ART neural network

We addressed the impact of physiological variables and abnormal blood biochemical and hematological parameters on cfDNA fragment size distribution. We also figured and validated that hematological inflammation markers, including leukocyte, lymphocyte, neutrophil, and platelet distribution width as well as aspartate transaminase levels were significantly correlated with the genome-wide cfDNA fragmentation pattern. Our findings suggest that cfDNA fragmentation profiles were associated with physiological parameters related to cardiovascular risk factors, inflammatory response and hepatocyte injury, which may provide insights for further research on the potential role of cfDNA fragmentation in diagnosis and monitor of several disease.",Biochemical parameters; Cell-free DNA; Fragmentomics; Hematology; Liver enzyme.
717,A Fully-Parallel Turbo Decoding Algorithm,"Maunder, Robert G.","This paper proposes a novel alternative to the Logarithmic Bahl-Cocke-Jelinek-Raviv (Log-BCJR) algorithm for turbo decoding, yielding significantly improved processing throughput and latency. While the Log-BCJR processes turbo-encoded bits in a serial forwards-backwards manner, the proposed algorithm operates in a fully-parallel manner, processing all bits in both components of the turbo code at the same time. The proposed algorithm is compatible with all turbo codes, including those of the LTE and WiMAX standards. These standardized codes employ odd-even interleavers, facilitating a novel technique for reducing the complexity of the proposed algorithm by 50%. More specifically, odd-even interleavers allow the proposed algorithm to alternate between processing the odd-indexed bits of the first component code at the same time as the even-indexed bits of the second component, and vice-versa. Furthermore, the proposed fully-parallel algorithm is shown to converge to the same error correction performance as the state-of-the-art turbo decoding algorithm. Owing to its significantly increased parallelism, the proposed algorithm facilitates throughputs and latencies that are up to 6.86 times superior to those of the state-of-the art algorithm, when employed for the LTE and WiMAX turbo codes. However, this is achieved at the cost of a moderately increased computational complexity and resource requirement.",Turbo codes; iterative decoding; parallel algorithms; throughput; WiMAX

Some synthetic chemicals, such as sibutramine (SB), have been detected as adulterants in herbal formulations. In this study, two strategies using near infrared (NIR) spectroscopy have been developed to evaluate potential adulteration of herbal medicines with SB: a qualitative screening approach and a quantitative methodology based on multivariate calibration. Samples were composed by products commercialized as herbal medicines, as well as by laboratory adulterated samples. Spectra were obtained in the range of 14,000-4000 per cm. Using PLS-DA, a correct classification of 100% was achieved for the external validation set.

For dual active bridge converters, the zero-voltage-switching (ZVS) conditions can be impaired under light load situations. While load depending ZVS operation has been introduced by prior-art approaches, the nonlinear characteristic of the output capacitance in a power device is often not considered and its effect on operating boundaries of ZVS is neglected. In this letter, based on practical switching transients, an improved method of calculating the ZVS range is introduced. By taking into account the nonlinearity of output capacitance, the method is developed from a detailed analysis of real switching transients. A 2.5-kW prototype is built, and a comprehensive comparison with prior-art approaches is conducted to validate the accuracy of the proposed method.",Dual active bridge converter; zero-voltage switching

C.; Huang, Xiaowei; Zheng, Yalin","Segmentation is a fundamental task in biomedical image analysis. Unlike the existing region-based dense pixel classification methods or boundary-based polygon regression methods, we build a novel graph neural network (GNN) based deep learning framework with multiple graph reasoning modules to explicitly leverage both region and boundary features in an end-to-end manner. The mechanism extracts discriminative region and boundary features, referred to as initialized region and boundary node embeddings, using a proposed Attention Enhancement Module (AEM). The weighted links between cross-domain nodes (region and boundary feature domains) in each graph are defined in a data-dependent way, which retains both global and local cross-node relationships. The iterative message aggregation and node update mechanism can enhance the interaction between each graph reasoning module's global semantic information and local spatial characteristics. Our model, in particular, is capable of concurrently addressing region and boundary feature reasoning and aggregation at several different feature levels due to the proposed multi-level feature node embeddings in different parallel graph reasoning modules. Experiments on two types of challenging datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches for segmentation of polyps in colonoscopy images and of the optic disc and optic cup in colour fundus images.

Since there currently lack methods particularly for UDA instance segmentation, we first design a Domain Adaptive Mask R-CNN (DAM) as the baseline, with cross-domain feature alignment at the image and instance levels. In addition to the image- and instance-level domain discrepancy, there also exists domain bias at the semantic level in the contextual information. Next, we, therefore, design a semantic segmentation branch with a domain discriminator to bridge the domain gap at the contextual level. By integrating the semantic- and instance-level feature adaptation, our method aligns the cross-domain features at the panoptic level. Third, we propose a task re-weighting mechanism to assign trade-off weights for the detection and segmentation loss functions. The task re-weighting mechanism solves the domain bias issue by alleviating the task learning for some iterations when the features contain source-specific factors. Furthermore, we design a feature similarity maximization mechanism to facilitate instance-level feature adaptation from the perspective of representational learning. Different from the typical feature alignment methods, our feature similarity maximization mechanism separates the domain-invariant and domain-specific features by enlarging their feature distribution dependency. Experimental results on three UDA instance segmentation scenarios with five datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed PDAM method, which outperforms state-of-the-art UDA methods by a large margin.",Image segmentation; Semantics; Task analysis; Feature extraction; Microscopy; Training; Adaptation models; Unsupervised domain adaptation; instance segmentation; microscopy images

It is known that several environmental factors can dramatically influence collective behavior, by eliciting behavioral adaptations in the individuals and altering physical pathways of social interactions in the group. Yet, empirical research has mostly focused on the quantification of the role of one factor at a time, with a paucity of studies designed to explore the multi-sensory basis of collective behavior. We investigated collective behavior of zebrafish (Danio rerio) pairs swimming in a water channel under combined manipulations of illumination (bright and dark) and flow conditions (absence and presence). The ability of the pair to orient and school increased in the presence of the flow and when fish were allowed to visually interact under bright illumination. Shoaling, instead, was only modulated by the illumination, so that fish swam at higher relative distances in the dark, irrespective of the flow. We also found evidence in favor of a modulatory effect of flow and illumination on the formation of the pair. Specifically, in the bright illumination, fish swam more side-by-side against a flow than in placid water; likewise, in the presence of a flow, they spent more time side-by-side in the bright illumination than in the dark. These findings point at a rich interplay between flow and illumination, whose alterations have profound effects on collective behavior.",Collective behavior; Danio rerio; Orientation; Schooling; Shoaling; Zebrafish.

The canonical pathway topology is characterized by sequential phosphorylation of kinases in the cytoplasm that defines the subcellular localization of YAP and TAZ. However, the molecular mechanisms controlling the nuclear/cytoplasmic shuttling dynamics of both factors under physiological and tissue-damaging conditions are poorly understood. By implementing experimental in vitro data, partial differential equation modeling, as well as automated image analysis, we demonstrate that nuclear phosphorylation contributes to differences between YAP and TAZ localization in the nucleus and cytoplasm. Treatment of hepatocyte-derived cells with hepatotoxic acetaminophen (APAP) induces a biphasic protein phosphorylation eventually leading to nuclear protein enrichment of YAP but not TAZ. APAP-dependent regulation of nuclear/cytoplasmic YAP shuttling is not an unspecific cellular response but relies on the sequential induction of reactive oxygen species (ROS), RAC-alpha serine/threonine-protein kinase (AKT, synonym: protein kinase B), as well as elevated nuclear interaction between YAP and AKT. Mouse experiments confirm this sequence of events illustrated by the expression of ROS-, AKT-, and YAP-specific gene signatures upon APAP administration. In summary, our data illustrate the importance of nuclear processes in the regulation of Hippo pathway activity. YAP and TAZ exhibit different shuttling dynamics, which explains distinct cellular responses of both factors under physiological and tissue-damaging conditions.",DILI; Hippo pathway; TAZ; acetaminophen; computational biology; human; medicine; mouse; partial differential equations; systems biology.

However, massive queries will introduce additional costs and exposure risks in the real world. Towards improving the attack efficiency, we carefully design an acceleration framework SAGE for existing black-box methods, which is composed of sLocator (initial point optimization) and sRudder (search process optimization). The core idea of SAGE in terms of 1) saliency map can guide the perturbations towards the most adversarial direction and 2) exploiting bounding box (bbox) to capture those salient pixels in the black-box attack. Meanwhile, we provide a series of observations and experiments that demonstrate bbox holds model invariance and process invariance. We extensively evaluate SAGE on four state-of-the-art black-box attacks involving three popular datasets (MNIST, CIFAR10, and ImageNet). The results show that SAGE could present fundamental improvements even against robust models that use adversarial training. Specifically, SAGE could reduce > 20% of queries and improve the success rate of attacks to 95%similar to 100%.

However, two difficulties are involved with traditional RBF (TRBF) networks: The initial configuration of an RBF network needs to be determined by a trial-and-error method, and the performance suffers when the desired output has abrupt changes or constant values in certain intervals. We propose a novel approach to overcome these difficulties. New kernel functions are used for hidden nodes, and the number of nodes is determined automatically by an adaptive resonance theory (ART)-like algorithm. Parameters and weights are initialized appropriately, and then tuned and adjusted by the gradient-descent method to improve the performance of the network.

Super-Resolution (SR) can effectively alleviate this contradiction. Recently, State-of-the-art image SR approaches leveraging Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNNs) have demonstrated high-quality reconstruction performance. However, most of them suffer from large model parameters, which restricts their practical application. Besides, image SR for large scaling factors (e.g., x8) is a tricky issue when the parameters diminish. To remedy these issues, we propose the Lightweight Multi-scale Aggregation Network (LMAN) for the image SR, which works well for both small and large scaling factors with limited parameters. Specifically, we propose a Group-wise Multi-scale Block (GMB) in which a group convolution is exploited for extracting and fusing multi-scale features before a channel attention layer to obtain discriminative features. Additionally, we present a novel Hierarchical Spatial Attention (HSA) mechanism to jointly and adaptively fuse local and global hierarchical features for high-resolution image reconstruction. Extensive experiments illustrate that our LMAN achieves superior performance against state-of-the-art methods with similar parameters and in particular for large scaling factors such as 4 x and 8x.",Super-resolution; lightweight network; multiscale; hierarchical spatial attention

FDAN consists of an appearance feature extractor, a motion-guided attention module and a saliency map regression module. It extracts the appearance feature per frame, refines appearance feature with optical flow and infers the ultimate saliency map, respectively. Motion-guided attention module is the core of FDAN, which extracts motion information in the form of attention. This attention mechanism is a two-branch CNN, fusing optical flow and appearance features. In addition, a shortcut connection is applied to the attention multiplied feature map for noise suppression intensively.

In addition, phylogenetic group B2 showed predominance in both the male and female groups, which further showed similar adhesion molecule distributions. Toxin-associated factors, hlyA and cnf1, were more common in males. In clinical presentations, urinary predisposing factors, complicated urinary tract infections (UTIs), concomitant bacteremia, and persistent fever were also more common with males. Although females and males showed UPEC genotypic differences, there were no differences between them with respect to poor outcomes. Persistent fever was associated with community-acquired infection and bacteremic UTI and relapsed UTI within 3 months was associated with urinary tract stone.

Keeping this view, the digestate should be upgraded or transformed into high valued products such as biofertilizer, pyrochar, biodiesel, syngas and soil conditioner that can aid to enrich the soil nutrients and ensures the safe environment as well. In this context, the present review focused to illustrate the current techniques and different strategic exploitations on AD proper management of digestate products for storage and further applications. Such a technology transfer provides a proven strategic mechanism towards the enhancement of the sustainability of bio-based industries, attaining the energy demand, safest waste management, protection of environment and reduces the socio-economic issues of the industrial sector.",Anaerobic digestion; Biochar; Biofertilizer; Biogas; Digestate utilization.
737,The critical role of quercetin in autophagy and apoptosis in HeLa cells,"Yijun Wang,Wei Zhang,Qiongying Lv,Juan Zhang,Dingjun Zhu,Yijun Wang,Wei Zhang,Qiongying Lv,Juan Zhang,Dingjun Zhu","In recent years, the effects of quercetin on autophagy and apoptosis of cancer cells have been widely reported, while effects on HeLa cells are still unclear. Here, HeLa cells were subjected to quercetin treatment, and then proliferation, apoptosis, and autophagy were evaluated using MTT, flow cytometry, and MDC staining, respectively. The LC3-I/II, Beclin 1, active caspase-3, and S6K1 phosphorylation were detected using Western blot assay. The ultrastructure of HeLa was observed via transmission electron microscope (TEM). Our findings showed that quercetin can dose-dependently inhibit the growth of HeLa cells. The MDC fluorescence was enhanced with increased concentration of quercetin and hit a plateau at 50 μmol/l. Western blot assay revealed that LC3-I/II ratio, Beclin 1, and active caspase-3 protein were enforced in a dose-dependent method. However, the phosphorylation of S6K1 gradually decreased, concomitant with an increase of autophagy. In addition, TEM revealed that the number of autophagic vacuoles was peaked at 50 μmol/l of quercetin. Besides, interference of autophagy with 3-MA led to proliferation inhibition and increased apoptosis in HeLa cells, accompanied by the decreased LC3-I/II conversion and the increased active caspase-3. In conclusion, quercetin can inhibit HeLa cell proliferation and induce protective autophagy at low concentrations; thus, 3-MA plus quercetin would suppress autophagy and effectively increased apoptosis.",Apoptosis; Autophagy; Cervical cancer; Quercetin.

The destruction displaced and uprooted families. Combining the Person-Process-Place Attachment Framework and Walsh's Family Resilience Framework, we examined how families in migration negotiated cultural and geographical separation as a family resilience process. This study piloted an art-based inquiry method. Families co-created art postcards and posters prompted by themes. We conducted focus groups to discuss art pieces. Nine different Latino family units in central FL participated in the intervention and focus groups. Families expressed conflicted attachments through feelings about displacement in migration and those left behind due to opportunities in the new migration context. Through visual and verbal representations, they expressed a liminal tension in the process of relocation (detachment) with a family-driven resolve on resiliency (reattachment). Understanding the process of family separation and displacement has on resilience through attachment can lead to future development of family interventions and better understanding of how to foster resilience. Attachment theory and resiliency played key roles in the participating families' process of adaptation to new migration settings.",Natural disaster; Migration; Family resilience; Attachment; Displacement
739,A rapid bacterial pathogen and antimicrobial resistance diagnosis workflow using Oxford nanopore adaptive sequencing method,"Hang Cheng,Yuhong Sun,Qing Yang,Minggui Deng,Zhijian Yu,Gang Zhu,Jiuxin Qu,Lei Liu,Liang Yang,Yu Xia,Hang Cheng,Yuhong Sun,Qing Yang,Minggui Deng,Zhijian Yu,Gang Zhu,Jiuxin Qu,Lei Liu,Liang Yang,Yu Xia","Metagenomic sequencing analysis (mNGS) has been implemented as an alternative approach for pathogen diagnosis in recent years, which is independent of cultivation and is able to identify all potential antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs). However, current mNGS methods have to deal with low amounts of prokaryotic deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and high amounts of host DNA in clinical samples, which significantly decrease the overall microbial detection resolution. The recently released nanopore adaptive sampling (NAS) technology facilitates immediate mapping of individual nucleotides to a given reference as each molecule is sequenced. User-defined thresholds allow for the retention or rejection of specific molecules, informed by the real-time reference mapping results, as they are physically passing through a given sequencing nanopore. We developed a metagenomics workflow for ultra-sensitive diagnosis of bacterial pathogens and ARGs from clinical samples, which is based on the efficient selective 'human host depletion' NAS sequencing, real-time species identification and species-specific resistance gene prediction. Our method increased the microbial sequence yield at least 8-fold in all 21 sequenced clinical Bronchoalveolar Lavage Fluid (BALF) samples (4.5 h from sample to result) and accurately detected the ARGs at species level. The species-level positive percent agreement between metagenomic sequencing and laboratory culturing was 100% (16/16) and negative percent agreement was 100% (5/5) in our approach. Further work is required for a more robust validation of our approach with large sample size to allow its application to other infection types.",antibiotic resistance genes; human host depletion; metagenomics pipeline; nanopore adaptive sampling; pathogen diagnosis.

Plants and animals harbour diverse microbial communities, which may be vital for their physiological performance and help them survive stressful climatic conditions. The extent to which microbiome communities change in response to warming or cooling may be important for predicting host performance under global change. Using a meta-analysis of 1377 microbiomes from 43 terrestrial and aquatic species, we found a decrease in the amplicon sequence variant-level microbiome phylogenetic diversity and alteration of microbiome composition under both experimental warming and cooling. Microbiome beta dispersion was not affected by temperature changes. We showed that the host habitat and experimental factors affected microbiome diversity and composition more than host biological traits. In particular, aquatic organisms-especially in marine habitats-experienced a greater depletion in microbiome diversity under cold conditions, compared to terrestrial hosts. Exposure involving a sudden long and static temperature shift was associated with microbiome diversity loss, but this reduction was attenuated by prior-experimental lab acclimation or when a ramped regime (i.e., warming) was used. Microbial differential abundance and co-occurrence network analyses revealed several potential indicator bacterial classes for hosts in heated environments and on different biome levels. Overall, our findings improve our understanding on the impact of global temperature changes on animal and plant microbiome structures across a diverse range of habitats. The next step is to link these changes to measures of host fitness, as well as microbial community functions, to determine whether microbiomes can buffer some species against a more thermally variable and extreme world.",global climate change; host microbiome; meta-analysis; microbiome disturbance; species persistence; temperature; thermal tolerance.

In humans, our understanding of this process has remained rudimentary owing to the inaccessibility of early implantation stages. Non-human primates recapitulate many aspects of human embryo development and provide crucial insights into trophoblast development, uterine receptivity and embryo invasion. Moreover, primate species exhibit a variety of implantation strategies and differ in embryo invasion depths. This review examines conservation and divergence of the key processes required for embryo implantation in different primates and in comparison with the canonical rodent model. We discuss trophectoderm compartmentalization, endometrial remodelling and embryo adhesion and invasion. Finally, we propose that studying the mechanism controlling invasion depth between different primate species may provide new insights and treatment strategies for placentation disorders in humans.

743,Explicit Edge Inconsistency Evaluation Model for Color-Guided Depth Map Enhancement,"Zuo, Yifan; Wu, Qiang; Zhang, Jian; An, Ping","Color-guided depth enhancement is used to refine depth maps according to the assumption that the depth edges and the color edges at the corresponding locations are consistent. In methods on such low-level vision tasks, the Markov random field (MRF), including its variants, is one of the major approaches that have dominated this area for several years. However, the assumption above is not always true. To tackle the problem, the state-of-the-art solutions are to adjust the weighting coefficient inside the smoothness term of the MRF model. These methods lack an explicit evaluation model to quantitatively measure the inconsistency between the depth edge map and the color edge map, so they cannot adaptively control the efforts of the guidance from the color image for depth enhancement, leading to various defects such as texture-copy artifacts and blurring depth edges. In this paper, we propose a quantitative measurement on such inconsistency and explicitly embed it into the smoothness term. The proposed method demonstrates promising experimental results compared with the benchmark and state-of-the-art methods on the Middlebury ToF-Mark, and NYU data sets.",Depth map completion; depth map enhancement; depth map superresolution (SR); Markov random field (MRF); RGB-D camera
744,Efficient Phase Estimation for Interferogram Stacks,"Ansari, Homa; De Zan, Francesco; Bamler, Richard","Signal decorrelation poses a limitation to multipass SAR interferometry. In pursuit of overcoming this limitation to achieve high-precision deformation estimates, different techniques have been developed, with short baseline subset, SqueeSAR, and CAESAR as the overarching schemes. These different analysis approaches raise the question of their efficiency and limitation in phase and consequently deformation estimation. This contribution first addresses this question and then proposes a new estimator with improved performance, called Eigendecomposition-based Maximum-likelihood-estimator of Interferometric phase (EMI). The proposed estimator combines the advantages of the state-of-the-art techniques. Identical to CAESAR, EMI is solved using eigendecomposition; it is therefore computationally efficient and straightforward in implementation. Similar to SqueeSAR, EMI is a maximumlikelihood-estimator; hence, it retains estimation efficiency. The computational and estimation efficiency of EMI renders it as an optimum choice for phase estimation. A further marriage of EMI with the proposed Sequential Estimator by Ansari et al. provides an efficient processing scheme tailored to the analysis of Big InSAR Data. EMI is formulated and verified in relation to the state-of-the-art approaches via mathematical formulation, simulation analysis, and experiments with time series of Sentinel-1 data over the volcanic island of Vulcano, Italy.",Terms-Big Data; coherence matrix; covariance estimation; differential interferometric synthetic aperture radar; distributed scatterers (DS); efficiency; error analysis; maximumlikelihood estimation; near real-time (NRT) processing

The proposed method reconstructs the difference between the previous and the current image frames. This difference image is sparse. We recover the sparse difference image from its partial k-space scans by using a nonconvex compressed sensing algorithm. As there was no previous fast enough algorithm for real-time reconstruction, we derive a novel algorithm for this purpose. Our proposed method has been compared against state-of-the-art offline and online reconstruction methods. The accuracy of the proposed method is less than offline methods but noticeably higher than the online techniques. For real-time reconstruction we are also concerned about the reconstruction speed. Our method is capable of reconstructing 128 x 128 images at the rate of 6 frames/s, 180 x 180 images at the rate of 5 frames/s and 256 256 images at the rate of 2.5 frames/s.",Compressed sensing (CS); magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)

J.; van Schijndel, A. W. M.; Schellen, H. L.","Museums are dedicated to protect their artwork collection and to display the collection as safely as possible. Amongst other things, the indoor climate is of utmost importance to minimize collection degradation. Many museums employ tight climate guidelines, allowing only small fluctuations of indoor temperature and relative humidity, resulting in the following problems: huge energy consumption, the need for high-capacity HVAC systems, additional stress on historical buildings. This simulation study investigates the energy-saving potential of different setpoint strategies. Damage functions were used to assess the degradation risk of the collection and an Adaptive Temperature Guideline was used to assess thermal comfort. A state-of-the-art museum in the Netherlands was modeled and the indoor climate and energy consumption were simulated, including heating, cooling, humidification and dehumidification. Maximum savings, compared to a reference situation, of 82% may be achieved. However, the optimum strategy yields a saving of 77%, significantly improves thermal comfort and decreases chemical degradation. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

A total of 88 samples were analyzed for the presence of potentially toxic elements in two seasons. In addition, an attempt is made to identify any possible associated health risks to the residents via the drinking water pathway. The study reveals the presence of various potentially toxic elements, in particular, manganese, iron, nickel, and fluoride concentration exceeding the drinking water specifications set by BIS and WHO drinking water standards. The degree of groundwater contamination was assessed using the Water Quality Index, Heavy metal Pollution Index, Heavy metal Evaluation Index, and Degree of Contamination. The spatial distribution maps of groundwater quality were prepared using geographical information system. The non-carcinogenic health risk was evaluated using hazard quotients and hazard index as per the United States Environmental Protection Agency methodology. The hazard quotient of fluoride and manganese have values > 1, which exceeds USEPA recommended benchmark. The health risk assessment identified that the risk was highest during the pre-monsoon season, and the child population is more vulnerable to non-carcinogenic risk than the adults. Findings of cancer risk identified that pre-monsoon groundwater samples from the Golaghat District pose the highest health risks in the upper Brahmaputra floodplains.

This study is aimed at developing a novel deep relational reasoning network to investigate whether conventional diffusion-weighted imaging connectome analysis can be improved when predicting expressive and receptive scores of preoperative language impairments and classifying postoperative seizure outcomes (seizure freedom or recurrence) in individual FE children. To deeply reason the dependencies of axonal connections that are sparsely distributed in the whole brain, this study proposes the ""dilated CNN + RN"", a dilated convolutional neural network (CNN) combined with a relation network (RN). The performance of the dilated CNN + RN was evaluated using whole brain connectome data from 51 FE children. It was found that when compared with other state-of-the-art algorithms, the dilated CNN + RN led to an average improvement of 90.2% and 97.3% in predicting expressive and receptive language scores, and 2.2% and 4% improvement in classifying seizure freedom and seizure recurrence, respectively. These improvements were independent of the prefixed connectome densities. Also, the dilated CNN + RN could provide an explainable artificial intelligence (AI) model by computing gradient-based regression/classification activation maps.

749,Integration of ART-Kohonen neural network and case-based reasoning for intelligent fault diagnosis,"Yang, BS; Han, T; Kim, YS","This paper presents a new approach for integrating case-based reasoning (CBR) with an ART-Kohonen neural network (ART-KNN) to enhance fault diagnosis. When solving a new problem, the neural network is used to make hypotheses and to guide the CBR module in the search for a similar previous case that supports one of the hypotheses. The knowledge acquired by the network is interpreted and mapped into symbolic diagnosis descriptors, which are kept and used by the system to determine whether a final answer is credible, and to build explanations for the reasoning carried out. ART-KNN, synthesizing the theory of adaptive resonance theory and the learning strategy of Kohonen neural network, can solve the plasticity-stability dilemma of conventional neural networks. It can carry out 'on-line' training without forgetting previously trained patterns (stable training), and recode previously trained categories adaptive to changes in the environment and is self-organizing, which differs from most of networks that only can be carried out off-line. The proposed system has been used in the faults diagnosis of electric motor to verify the system performance. The result shows the proposed system performs better than self-organizing feature map (SOFM) based system with respect to classification rate. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

However, there is still a significant gap in performance between these real-time methods and the models based on dilation backbones. To this end, we proposed a family of deep dual-resolution networks (DDRNets) for real-time and accurate semantic segmentation, which consist of deep dual-resolution backbones and enhanced low-resolution contextual information extractors. The two deep branches and multiple bilateral fusions of backbones generate higher quality details compared to existing two-pathway methods. The enhanced contextual information extractor named Deep Aggregation Pyramid Pooling Module (DAPPM) enlarges effective receptive fields and fuses multi-scale context based on low-resolution feature maps with little time cost. Our method achieves a new state-of-the-art trade-off between accuracy and speed on both Cityscapes and CamVid dataset.

Herein, trace phytoavailable heavy metals in soil are first extracted by 0.1 M NaNO3, afterwards adsorbed onto an activated carbon tip via electroextraction (EE), and finally analyzed by dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) microplasma optical emission spectrometry (OES) via in situ desorption. The activated carbon tip is not only able to extract heavy metals from alkali metals/alkaline earth metals matrix, resisting the interference of coexisting anions and non-electroactive species in saline soil extract, but also significantly improves the detection sensitivity of subsequent DBD-OES analysis by increasing loading amounts of analytes. Taking the key heavy metals pollution as model, the detection limits of Cd, Zn, Cu and Pb reach 0.8, 2.3, 6.0 and 4.5 μg kg-1, respectively, and precisions are within 2.7-4.6%.

That is why six physicochemical quantities have been determined in a previous work for each one heterogeneous system between organic volatile pollutants and oxide-pigments of works of art. This investigation is extended in order to determine experimentally five new ones. Thus, a more precise contribution to the elucidation of the mechanism of the deterioration of various works of art in museums is achieved. These physicochemical quantities are: (1) local adsorption energies, (2) local monolayer capacities, (3) local adsorption isotherms, (4) density probability function, and (5) pollutant concentration on the oxide-pigment at equilibrium.

The main acylation products were eight quercetin ester derivatives, respectively, consisting of varying acyl groups ranging from 2 to 18 carbon atoms (acetate, butyrate, caproate, caprylate, caprate, laurate, myristate, and stearate). The purified quercetin esters were structurally characterized by LC-ESI-ToF and NMR HSQC. Meanwhile, several classical chemical (DPPH, ABTS, FRAP, and Fe2+ chelation assays), food (β-carotene bleaching assay), and biological (LDL and DNA oxidation assays) models were constructed to evaluate and systematically compare their antioxidant efficacy. O-Acylation increased the lipophilicity of quercetin derivatives, and lipophilicity increased with the increasing chain length of the acyl group. The dual effect of the acyl chain length on biasing quercetin monoesters' antioxidant efficacies has been summarized and verified.

The major challenge for online set intersection is to sustain line-rate processing speed; accelerating set intersection using state-of-the-art hardware devices is of great interest to the research community. In this paper, we present a novel high-performance set intersection approach on FPGA. In our approach, each element in any set is represented by a combination of Group ID (GID) and Bit Stride (BS); all the sets are intersected using linear merge techniques and bitwise AND operations. We map our online set intersection algorithm onto hardware; this is done by constructing modular Processing Element (PE) and concatenating multiple PEs into a tree-based parallel architecture. In order to improve the throughput on a state-of-the-art FPGA, we feed all the inputs to FPGA in a streaming fashion with the help of the synchronization GIDs. Post place-and-route results show that, for a typical set intersection problem in network processing, our design can intersect eight sets, each of up to 32 K elements, at a throughput of 47: 4 Thousand Intersections Per Second (KIPS) and a latency of 94: 8 mu s per batch of inputs.

With the recent advancement in digital imaging technology coupled with the rising popularity of social media such as Instagram, automatic geometric abstraction that can automatically transform a photograph into a piece of geometric art starts to gain research attention. Several state-of-the-art works have been proposed. Notably, despite the fact that Cubism artworks by renown artists illustrate the importance of the main subject in a painting to be recognizable and should be given more detailed representation, most of the state-of-the-art abstraction algorithms are not subject-focused. In this paper, we present Pic2PolyArt, a unified subject-focused geometric abstraction framework that can support both triangle-based and polygon-based abstraction. Given an input photograph, our proposed algorithm first identifies the main subject and important features of an image with a combination of saliency, edge, and face detection techniques. It then generates a set of seed points that are used by Delaunay Triangulation and Voronoi Tessellation to generate triangle-based and polygon-based geometric abstraction respectively. Results from qualitative evaluation on benchmark dataset and empirical user studies demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed abstraction framework in generating pleasant geometric abstraction from photographs and provide insightful knowledge on users preference with regards to the type of polygons and the level of abstraction used to represent the resulting geometric art.",Geometric art; Computational art; Low poly rendering; Style transfer; Non-photorealistic rendering

Results: EFA yielded a single-factor solution at baseline after dropping one item. CFA at follow-up corroborated the single-factor. Cronbach's alpha was high and MTVS was correlated with ART adherence at both time points. MTVS at baseline and 6 months were correlated. Conclusion: The 17-item MTVS scale was found to be valid and reliable and related to ART adherence.",youth living with HIV; technology; mobile telephone; adherence; antiretroviral therapy; scale development

762,Association Between Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms of miRNAs and Gastric Cancer: A Scoping Review,"Lili Pan,Yuanping Shi,Jun Zhang,Guanghua Luo,Lili Pan,Yuanping Shi,Jun Zhang,Guanghua Luo","Background: Gastric cancer (GC) is the third leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide, and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in microRNAs (miRNAs) are believed to affect the occurrence and progression of cancer by altering the expression and biological functions of miRNAs. Methods: The present scoping review was designed to evaluate and discuss microRNA SNPs (miR-SNPs) that have been found to be associated with GC in the following two contexts: (1) the biological effects on GC based on SNP localization; and (2) the associations between miRNA-SNPs and clinical factors (susceptibility, tumor size, metastasis, overall survival, and prognosis) of GC. Results and Conclusions: Information on miRNAs was collected, including the SNPs, their proven target genes, and the possible impact of the SNPs on GC outcome. Our findings suggest an etiological or modifying role for multiple miRNA SNPs (miR-499, miR-146a, miR-149, miR-148, miR-27a, miR-608, miR-196a-2) in GC and its progression. The findings of this study reinforce the multiple roles of miRNA SNPs in GC.",gastric cancer; gastric carcinoma; microRNAs; single nucleotide polymorphism.

In this paper, we present a fully automatic method for skin lesion segmentation by leveraging 19-layer deep convolutional neural networks that is trained end-to-end and does not rely on prior knowledge of the data. We propose a set of strategies to ensure effective and efficient learning with limited training data. Furthermore, we design a novel loss function based on Jaccard distance to eliminate the need of sample re-weighting, a typical procedure when using cross entropy as the loss function for image segmentation due to the strong imbalance between the number of foreground and background pixels. We evaluated the effectiveness, efficiency, as well as the generalization capability of the proposed framework on two publicly available databases. One is from ISBI 2016 skin lesion analysis towards melanoma detection challenge, and the other is the PH2 database. Experimental results showed that the proposed method outperformed other state-of-the-art algorithms on these two databases. Our method is general enough and only needs minimum pre- and post-processing, which allows its adoption in a variety of medical image segmentation tasks.",Deep learning; fully convolutional neural networks; image segmentation; jaccard distance; melanoma; dermoscopy

For this evaluation, we use two applications from two fields, namely, cybersecurity and bioinformatics. The first application, called Fast-SNAP, scans network data for 4312 signatures of intrusion derived from the popular open-source Snort database. Using the resources of a single AP-board, Fast-SNAP can scan for all these signatures at 1 Gbps. The second application, called PROTOMATA, looks for all the occurrences of 1,309 motifs from the PROSITE database in protein sequences. PROTOMATA is up to 68 times faster than the state-of-the-art CPU implementation. As a comparison, we emulate the execution of the same NFAs by programming FPGAs using state-of-the-art techniques. We find that the performance derived by using the resources of a single AP-board, which houses 32 AP-chips, is comparable to that of the resources of five to six large FPGAs. The design techniques used in this paper are generic and may be applicable to the development of similar applications on the AP.",Finite automata; regular expressions; automata processor; FPGAs; intrusion detection; protein motifs
769,The influence of 5-fluorouracil on the α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complex in rat's cardiac muscle - a preliminary study,"Małgorzata Knapik-Czajka,Anna Gawędzka,Michał Jurczyk,Jagoda Drąg,Małgorzata Belczyk,Veronika Aleksanrovych,Anna Gil,Krzysztof Gil,Małgorzata Knapik-Czajka,Anna Gawędzka,Michał Jurczyk,Jagoda Drąg,Małgorzata Belczyk,Veronika Aleksanrovych,Anna Gil,Krzysztof Gil","5-fluorouracil (5-FU), which is a commonly used chemotherapy agent exerts undesired cardiac toxicity. Mitochondrial dysfunction is thought to be one of potentially important mechanisms of 5-FU- induced cardiotoxicity. α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase (α-KGDHC) is the key regulatory enzyme of TCA cycle. The complex consists of multiple copies of three catalytic subunits: α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase (E1), dihydrolipoamide succinyltransferase (E2) and dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase (E3). α-KGDHC together with branched chain α-ketoacid dehydrogenase (BCKDH) and pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH), are the members of 2-oxoacid dehydrogenases family that share some structural and functional similarities. Recently, it has been found that 5-FU stimulates BCKDH in rat's cardiac muscle. Therefore, we hypothesize that 5-FU modifies α-KGDHC activity and affects cardiac muscle metabolism. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of 5-FU on α-KGDHC activity and protein levels of E1 and E2 subunits of the complex in rat's cardiac muscle. Wistar male rats were administered with 4 doses of 5-FU, 150 mg/ kg b.wt. each (study group) or 0.3% methylcellulose (control group). α-KGDHC activity was assayed spectrophotometrically. The E1 and E2 proteins levels were quantified by Western blot. 5-FU administration resulted in stimulation of myocardial α-KGDHC activity in rats. In addition, E2 protein level increased in response to 5-FU treatment, while the E1 protein level remained unchanged. Up-regulation of α-KGDHC appears to result from change in E2 subunit protein level. However, the effect of 5-FU on factors modifying α-KGDHC activity at post-translational level cannot be excluded.",5-fluorouracil; cardiac muscle; rats; α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase.

However, no unanimous consensus has been achieved on which of these surgeries is the most suitable to the individual patient. Herein, we review the available literature of the last 30 years with the aim of defining a simple and reproduceable treatment algorithm to treat DALO. A search of PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus and Cochrane databases was last performed in December 2021 to examine evidence regarding the role of END-DCR and EXT-DCR in primary and revision surgeries. If considered primary surgeries, END-DCR should be preferred in case of intranasal comorbidities, given the possibility to directly visualize and treat potential intranasal pathologies. Conversely, EXT-DCR should be chosen in case of need/preference for local anesthesia, given the major historical experience and wider surgical field that helps to resolve intra-operatory complications (e.g., bleeding) in an uncollaborative patient. In the absence of the abovementioned conditions, the decision of one or other approach should be discussed with the patient. In recurrent cases, END-DCR should be considered the treatment of choice given the major likelihood to visualize the causes of primary failure and directly resolve it. In conclusion, END-DCR should be considered the treatment of choice in revision cases or in primary ones associated with intranasal pathologies, whereas EXT-DCR should be chosen if local anesthesia is needed. In the absence of these scenarios, it is still open to debate which of these two approaches should be used.",Lacrimal disease obstructions; lacrimal disease obstructions: diagnostic tests; lacrimal disease obstructions: lacrimal system trauma; lacrimal disease obstructions: lower system disease; lacrimal disease obstructions: upper system disease.

The level of the hormone fluctuates over time, but with traditional laboratory-based assays, such dynamics cannot be monitored in real time. Here, a reversible cortisol sensor is reported that allows continuous monitoring of cortisol in blood plasma using sampling by microdialysis. The sensor is based on measuring single-molecule binding and unbinding events of tethered particles. The particles are functionalized with antibodies and the substrate with cortisol-analogues, causing binding and unbinding events to occur between particles and substrate. The frequency of binding events is reduced when cortisol is present in the solution as it blocks the binding sites of the antibodies. The sensor responds to cortisol in the high nanomolar to low micromolar range and can monitor cortisol concentrations over multiple hours. Results are shown for cortisol monitoring in filtered and in microdialysis-sampled human blood plasma.",affinity binder; continuous monitoring; microdialysis; real time; single-molecule resolution; tethered particle.

It gives state-of-the-art accuracy in many applications such as speech recognition, natural language processing and video classifications. Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) have been used to speed up the inference of LSTMs, but FPGA-based LSTM accelerators are limited by the size of on-chip memory and the bandwidth of external memory on FPGA boards. We propose a novel hardware architecture to overcome data dependency and a new blocking-batching strategy to reuse the LSTM weights fetched from external memory to optimize the performance of systems with size-limited on-chip memory for large machine learning models. Evaluation results show that our architecture can achieve 20.8 GOPS/W, which is among the highest for the FPGA-based LSTM designs storing weights in off-chip memory. Our design achieves 1.65 times higher performance-per-watt efficiency and 2.48 times higher performance-per-DSP efficiency when compared with the current state-of-the-art designs of LSTM using weights stored in off-chip memory. Compared with CPU and GPU implementations, our FPGA implementation is 23.7 and 1.3 times faster while consuming 208 and 19.2 times lower energy respectively, which shows that our approach enables large LSTM systems to be processed efficiently on FPGAs with high performance and low power consumption.",LSTM; FPGA; Hardware architecture

These data have been used to update conventional risk models such as the Revised International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS-R). Whether the molecular IPSS (IPSS-M) which includes these data improves survival prediction accuracy is untested. To answer this question, we compared survival prediction accuracies of the IPSS-R and IPSS-M in 852 consecutive subjects with de novo MDS. Concordance statistics (C-statistics) of the IPSS-R and IPSS-M in the entire cohort were similar, 0.67 (95% Confidence Interval [CI] 0.64, 0.71) and 0.68 (0.64, 0.71).

Simultaneously, several research works showed the interest of using multifractal analysis for the description of homogeneous textures in images. In this context, the goal of the present contribution is to study the benefits of using the wavelet leader based multifractal formalism to characterize paintings. After a brief review of the underlying key theoretical concepts, methods and tools, two sets of digitized paintings are analyzed. The first one, the Princeton Experiment, consists of a set of seven paintings and their replicas, made by the same artist. It enables examination of the potential of multifractal analysis in forgery detection. The second one is composed of paintings by Van Gogh and contemporaries, made available by the Van Gogh and Kroller-Muller Museums (Netherlands) in the framework of the Image processing for Art Investigation research program. It enables us to show various differences in the regularity of textures of Van Gogh's paintings from different periods, or between Van Gogh's and contemporaries' paintings.

The research has the potential to provide a powerful tool to art historians for studying connections among artists or periods in the history of art. Depending on specific applications, paintings can be categorized in different ways. In this paper, we focus on comparing the painting styles. of artists. To profile the style of an artist, a mixture of stochastic models is estimated using training images. The two-dimensional (2-D) multiresolution hidden Markov model (MHMM) is used in the experiment. These models form an artist's distinct digital signature. For certain types of paintings, only strokes provide reliable information to distinguish artists. Chinese ink paintings are a prime example of the above phenomenon; they do not have colors or even tones. The 2-D MHMM analyzes relatively large regions in an image, which in turn makes it more likely to capture properties of the painting strokes. The mixtures of 2-D MHMMs established for artists can be further used to classify paintings and compare paintings or artists. We implemented and tested the system using high-resolution digital photographs of some of China's most renowned artists. Experiments have demonstrated good potential of our approach in automatic analysis of paintings.

The dust samples were digested in aqua regia and their metal concentrations were quantified by atomic absorption spectrometry. The concentrations of metals in dust from visual arts studios ranged from not detected (nd) to 91.5 mg kg(-1) Cd, 4.5 to 540 mg kg(-1) Pb, 0.10 to 1,100 mg kg(-1) Cr, 0.50 to 1,150 mg kg(-1) Ni, 10 to 15,600 mg kg(-1) Cu, 0.5 to 146 mg kg(-1) Co, 3.0 to 3,680 mg kg(-1) Mn, 93.5 to 9,600 mg kg(-1) Zn, and 853 to 237,000 mg kg(-1) Fe. The degree of contamination of the dust particles by metals was assessed by making use of the contamination/pollution index, geoaccumulation index and enrichment factor. These indices suggested that dusts from these visual arts studios were impacted with Cd, Pb, Cu, and Zn. The hazard index (HI) and cancer risk values relating to adults' exposure to metals in dust from these arts studios were within safe limits. Principal component analysis indicated that the sources of metal contamination in dust from these visual arts studios were related to inputs from constituents of the artist's materials and vehicular emissions.",Risk; contaminants; monitoring human health; heavy metals; tertiary institution; Nigeria

However, CNN have drawbacks, i.e. they fail to extract long-range perceptions in images. Due to their ability to capture long-range dependencies, transformer networks are adopted in computer vision applications, where they show state-of-the-art (SOTA) results in popular tasks like image classification, instance segmentation, and object detection. Although they gained ample attention, transformers have not been applied to 3D face reconstruction tasks. In this work, we propose a novel hierarchical transformer model, added to a feature pyramid aggregation structure, to extract the 3D face parameters from a single 2D image. More specifically, we use pre-trained Swin Transformer backbone networks in a hierarchical manner and add the feature fusion module to aggregate the features in multiple stages. We use a semi-supervised training approach and train our model in a supervised way with the 3DMM parameters from a publicly available dataset and unsupervised training with a differential renderer on other parameters like facial keypoints and facial features. We also train our network on a hybrid unsupervised loss and compare the results with other SOTA approaches. When evaluated across two public datasets on face reconstruction and dense 3D face alignment tasks, our method can achieve comparable results to the current SOTA performance and in some instances do better than the SOTA methods. A detailed subjective evaluation also shows that our method performs better than the previous works in realism and occlusion resistance.",Face reconstruction; Feature fusion; Hierarchical transformer; Swin Transformer; ViT.

We demonstrate that our heuristics are competitive with existing approaches and produce high-quality solutions for both balanced and unbalanced networks. Finally, we introduce a novel application of process flexibility in healthcare operations to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in a large numerical case study. We study the flexibility of linear accelerators that deliver radiation to treat various types of cancer. We demonstrate how clinical constraints can be easily absorbed into the machine learning subroutine and how our sparse flexible treatment networks meet or beat the performance of those designed by state-of-the-art methods.",Process flexibility; Machine learning; Healthcare operations; Radiation therapy; Optimization; Network flow

782,A Joint Learning Framework With BERT for Spoken Language Understanding,"Zhang, Zhichang; Zhang, Zhenwen; Chen, Haoyuan; Zhang, Zhiman","Intent classification and slot filling are two essential tasks for spoken language understanding. Recently, joint learning has been shown to be effective for the two tasks. However, most joint learning methods only consider joint learning using shared parameters on the surface level rather than the semantic level, and these methods suffer from small-scale human-labeled training data, resulting in poor generalization capabilities, especially for rare words. In this paper, we propose a novel encoder-decoder framework based multi-task learning model, which conducts joint training for intent classification and slot filling tasks. For the encoder of our model, we encode the input sequence as context representations using bidirectional encoder representation from transformers (BERT). For the decoder, we implement two-stage decoder process in our model. In the first stage, we use an intent classification decoder to detect the user's intent. In the second stage, we leverage the intent contextual information into the slot filling decoder to predict the semantic concept tags for each word.

The decline in the endogenous production of estrogen (especially the main circulating physiological hormone, 17β-estradiol, E2) at menopause (51 years on average) often leads to functional disorders affecting the quality of life. Estrogen deficiency impacts different tissues and results in an increase of various diseases, such as osteoporosis or cardiovascular diseases. Hormone therapy (HT) for menopause is a rather new challenge which experienced vagaries following the women's health initiative (WHI) study conducted in largely post-menopausal women. In the first part of this review, we will try to summarize the main conclusions of the WHI trials, in particular the timing effect as well as the deleterious impact of the associated progestin, medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA). Hormone therapy, particularly the conjugated equine estrogen (CEE) combined with the MPA favor the occurrence of breast cancer, whereas conversely selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs, such as tamoxifen or raloxifene) that block the activity of estrogen receptor alpha (ERa) prevent the risk of recurrence of ERa-positive breast cancers. A new strategy of ERa modulation called tissue selective estrogen complex (TSEC), combines (1) CEE to maintain the benefits of estrogen (climacteric symptoms and prevention of osteoporosis) and (2) bazedoxifene, which is not only a SERM, but which also induces a rapid degradation of ERa in the uterus and in the breast, thereby prevents the stimulatory effects of estrogens on epithelial proliferation of these two sex targets. In the second part of this review, we will summarize the recognized benefits of the TSEC approach, and our current knowledge of its potential benefits and risks.",Estrogen receptor; Menopause; Tissue selective estrogen complex.

As a result, extensive efforts have been made to design novel techniques for efficient drug monitoring and screening, which form the backbone of drug development. Compared to traditional techniques, microfluidics-based platforms have emerged as promising alternatives for high-throughput drug screening due to their inherent miniaturization characteristics, low sample consumption, integration, and compatibility with diverse analytical strategies. Moreover, the microfluidic-based models utilizing human cells to produce in-vitro biomimetics of the human body pave new ways to predict more accurate drug effects in humans. This review provides a comprehensive summary of different microfluidics-based drug sensing and screening strategies and briefly discusses their advantages. Most importantly, an in-depth outlook of the commonly used detection techniques integrated with microfluidic chips for highly sensitive drug screening is provided. Then, the influence of critical parameters such as sensing materials and microfluidic platform geometries on screening performance is summarized. This review also outlines the recent applications of microfluidic approaches for screening therapeutic and illicit drugs. Moreover, the current challenges and the future perspective of this research field is elaborately highlighted, which we believe will contribute immensely towards significant achievements in all aspects of drug development.",Illicit drugs; Microfluidics; Nanomaterials; Nanosensors; Sensing techniques.

However, the clinical value of the circulating mtDNA copy number alterations in hematologic malignancies is poorly understood. Our data showed that in comparison to healthy group, the patients group had significantly higher mtDNA and histone H4 levels. Moreover, we observed that RBC-bound mtDNA and histone H4 were negatively correlated with hemoglobin in patients. In addition, cytokines and chemokines levels in patients differed significantly from normal controls (21 higher, 7 lower). Our study suggested that both circulating mtDNA and histone H4 were associated with anemia in hematologic malignancies, which helps to further understand the potential mechanism of anemia development in patients with hematologic malignancies.

Yet, the current literature, with its vast contributions, has the potential in enhancing the current state of the art by employing both DL and novel visualization methods to boost classification performance and speed. Therefore, this article presents a dual classification system for high-performance gas classification: on 1-D time series data and 2-D Gramian Angular Field (GAF) data. For the GAF case study, 1-D data are converted into 2-D counterparts by means of normalization, segmentation, averaging, and color coding. The gas sensor array (GSA) dataset is used for evaluating the implemented AlexNet model for classifying 2-D GAF data and an improved version of GasNet for 1-D time-based data. Using a cloud-based architecture, the two models are evaluated and benchmarked with the state of the art. Evaluation results of the modified GasNet model on time series data signify the state-of-the-art accuracy of 96.5%, while AlexNet achieved 81.0% test accuracy of GAF classification with near real-time performance on edge computing platforms.",Convolutional neural networks; Time series analysis; Sensors; Gas detectors; Data models; Genetic algorithms; Image sensors; Artificial intelligence; deep learning (DL); gas classification; gas sensor array (GSA); Gramian angular field (GAF); time series

Current state-of-the-art super-resolution (SR) methods commonly adopt the convolutional neural networks to learn a non-linear complex mapping between paired LR and HR images. They discriminate local patterns expressed by the neighboring pixels along the planar directions but ignore the intrinsic 3D proximity including the depth map. As a special case of general images, the face has limited geometric variations, which we believe that the relevant depth map can be learned and used to guide the face SR task. Motivated by it, we design a network including two branches: one for auxiliary depth map estimation and the other for the main SR task. Adaptive geometric features are further learned from the depth map and used to modulate the mid-level features of the SR branch. The whole network is implemented in an end-to-end trainable manner under the extra supervision of depth map. The supervisory depth map is either a paired one from RGB-D scans or a reconstructed one by a 3D prior model of faces. The experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method and achieve improved performance over the state of the arts.",Convolutional neural networks (CNNs); Depth map; Face super-resolution

Rapid and accurate identification of affected areas is crucial for effective disaster response and recovery efforts. In this paper, we aimed to evaluate the performance of state-of-the-art (SOTA) computer vision models for flood image classification, by utilizing a semi-supervised learning approach on a dataset named FloodNet. To achieve this, we trained son 11 state-of-the-art (SOTA) models and modified them to suit the classification task at hand. Furthermore, we also introduced a technique of varying the uncertainty offset lambda in the models to analyze its impact on the performance. The models were evaluated using standard classification metrics such as Loss, Accuracy, F1 Score, Precision, Recall, and ROC-AUC. The results of this study provide a quantitative comparison of the performance of different CNN architectures for flood image classification, as well as the impact of different uncertainty offset lambda. These findings can aid in the development of more accurate and efficient disaster response and recovery systems, which could help in minimizing the impact of natural disasters.",flood detection; image classification; deep learning

In the noise and low-contrast regions, most existing methods may only produce an incomplete and disconnected extraction of the vessel centerline if no user guidance is provided. A robust and automatic method is described for extraction of the vessel centerline. First, we perform small vessel enhancement by processing with a set of line detection filters, corresponding to the 13 orientations; for each voxel, the highest filter response is kept and added to the image. Second, we extract vessel centerline segment candidates by a thinning algorithm. Finally, a global optimization algorithm is employed for grouping and selecting vessel centerline segments. We validate the proposed method quantitatively on a number of synthetic data sets, the liver artery and lung vessel. Comparisons are made with two state-of-the-art vessel centerline extraction methods and manual extraction. The experiments show that our method is more accurate and robust that these state-of-the-art methods and is, therefore, more suited for automatic vessel centerline extraction. (C) The Authors.

The virus and host determinants that govern this intracellular trafficking remain unknown. Here, we confirmed that host adaptor protein (AP) complexes are involved in NDV infection using small interfering RNA. The transport of viral F protein to the cell surface depends on host transport proteins. We observed that the trends for host expression of AP complexes AP1M1 and AP2M1 were similar to those of mutated F proteins, especially in the membrane protein. NDV F protein interacted with AP1M1 and AP2M1, and the YLMY motif influenced this interaction. Knockdown of AP1M1 or AP2M1 suppressed the intracellular and extracellular virus titre of mutated-YLMY-motif NDVs, especially rSG10*-F/Y527A and rSG10*-F/Y524AY527A, to varying degrees. Therefore, the YLMY motif regulates AP-mediated viral F protein transportation from the cytoplasm to the cell surface and subsequently affects viral titer. We further found that the YLMY-motif mutants were differently associated with the process of AAK1 and GAK kinase-mediated AP - viral F protein interaction. These data demonstrate that the essential YLMY motif located in the NDV F protein cytoplasmic tail recruits AP to direct the F protein to the cell surface, which is necessary for its ability to affect virus budding. This study provides support for a deeper understanding of virus and host determinants that facilitate virus trafficking, which can be exploited in the design of novel antiviral therapies.","AP transport; F protein; Newcastle disease virus, NDV; YLMY motif; cytoplasmic tail."

792,Image phylogeny tree construction based on local inheritance relationship correction,"Zhu, Nan; Shen, Junge","With the popularization of image editing software and social networks, digital images can be easily downloaded, re-edited and re-distributed on the Internet, which brings a large amount of near-duplicate images (NDIs) whose content are slightly different. The underlying transformation history within a group of NDIs is a powerful tool to determine both the image originality and authenticity. Recent works have focus on the construction of image phylogeny tree (IPT), i.e., a directed acyclic graph to describe the genealogical relationship within NDIs. State-of-the-art approaches for IPT construction share a common two-step pipeline: i) dissimilarity matrix estimation with a dissimilarity function; and ii) tree structure construction with a tree-building algorithm. Many approaches addressed on dissimilarity matrix estimation as the accuracy of the tree-building algorithms are significantly impaired by this step. Different from these methods, in this paper, instead of proposing a novel dissimilarity matrix estimation method, we design an IPT construction framework based on local inheritance relationship correction. The motivation among our proposed framework is that the negative influence of an inaccurate dissimilarity matrix can be suppressed by a subsequent correction. Extensive experimental results show that our proposed approach can achieve better performance for IPT construction under various challenging scenarios when compared with the state-of-the-art IPT construction algorithms.",Image phylogeny tree; Image forensics; Multimedia phylogeny; Near duplicated images; Optimum branching

Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have contributed to state-of-the-art performance in HSI destriping given their powerful feature extraction and learning capabilities. However, it is difficult to obtain paired training samples for real data. Most CNN destriping methods construct a paired training dataset with simulated stripe noise for network training. However, when the stripe noise of real data is complex, destriping performance of the model is constrained. To solve this problem, this study proposes a real HSI stripe removal method using a toward real HSI stripe removal via direction constraint hierarchical feature cascade network (TRS-DCHC). TRS-DCHC uses the stripe noise extract subnetwork to extract stripe patterns from real stripe-containing HSI data and incorporates clean images to form paired training samples. The destriping subnetwork advantageously utilizes a wavelet transform to explicitly decompose stripe and stripe-free components. It also adopts multi-scale feature dense connections and feature fusion to enrich feature information and deeply mine the discriminate features of stripe and stripe-free components. Our experiments on both simulated and real data of various loads showed that TRS-DCHC features better performance in both simulated and real data compared with state-of-the-art method.",deep convolutional neural network (CNN); hyperspectral image; stripe noise removal; wavelet transform

Evaluating water quality in rivers, researchers have referred to various statistical, probabilistic and stochastic methods to obtain efficient information from the monitoring network. As data are greatly random, the information content can be obtained by utilizing various methods including but not limited to the ""entropy."" Monitoring is a difficult process due to high measurement costs, while it is also difficult to optimize the network in terms of time, space, and especially the variable to be monitored. In the presented study, it is aimed to create an effective approach to be used in optimizing the monitoring network by determining the ""prior"" variables by entropy that measures the uncertainty by using all the data without time difference. The presented study proposes an alternative method to define the water quality variables that should be monitored much more frequently. Study is exemplified for demonstrating its potential use in a case study level, Grand River in Canada, by assessing water quality data obtained from 15 water quality monitoring stations. Results showed that BOD, Cl, and NO2-N among examined 8 different variables are as the ""prior"" variables should be monitored. It is being proven that the prior variable that should be monitored for optimization of the network can be easily determined with the information obtained from the data statistically evaluated with entropy, and it can be stated as an effective method for managers to use in the decision-making process.",Entropy; Monitoring priority variable; Pollution; Water quality; Water resource management.

H.; Sheng, Bin; Zhang, Benxuan; Wu, Enhua","Non-uniform motion blur due to object movement or camera jitter is a common phenomenon in videos. However, the state-of-the-art video deblurring methods used to deal with this problem can introduce artifacts, and may sometimes fail to handle motion blur due to the movements of the object or the camera. In this paper, we propose a non-uniform motion model to deblur video frames. The proposed method is based on superpixel matching in the video sequence to reconstruct sharp frames from blurry ones. To identify a suitable sharp superpixel to replace a blurry one, we enrich the search space with a non-uniform motion blur kernel, and use a generalized PatchMatch algorithm to handle rotation, scale, and blur differences in the matching step. Instead of using pixel-based or regular patch-based representation, we adopt a superpixel-based representation, and use color and motion to gather similar pixels. Our non-uniform motion blur kernels are estimated from the motion field of these superpixels, and our spatially varying motion model considers spatial and temporal coherence to find sharp superpixels. Experimental results showed that the proposed method can reconstruct sharp video frames from blurred frames caused by complex object and camera movements, and performs better than the state-of-the-art methods.",Video deblurring; non-uniform blur kernel; image deblurring; video processing

However, exploiting an Na metal anode is accompanied by uncontrolled Na electrodeposition, particularly concerning dendrite growth, hampering practical Na metal battery applications. Herein, we propose sodiophilic gel polymer electrolytes with a porosity-gradient Janus structure to alleviate Na dendrite growth. Tethering only 1.1 mol % sodiophilic poly(ethylene glycol) to poly(vinylidene fluoride-co-hexafluoropropylene) suppresses Na dendrites by regulating homogeneous Na+ distribution, which relies on molecular-level coordination between Na+ and the sodiophilic functional groups. By exploiting the porosity-gradient Janus structure, we have demonstrated that regular porosity and well-defined morphology of polymer electrolytes, particularly at the Na/electrolyte interface, significantly impact dendrite growth.

Objectives: To evaluate the possible association between exposures to air pollution during pregnancy and congenital malformations among infants born following spontaneously conceived (SC) pregnancies and assisted reproductive technology (ART) pregnancies. Methods: This is an historical cohort study comprising 216,730 infants: 207,825 SC infants and 8905 ART conceived infants, during the periods 1997-2004. Air pollution data including sulfur dioxide (SO2), particulate matter <10 mu m (PM10), nitrogen oxides (NOx) and ozone (O-3) were obtained from air monitoring stations database for the study period. Using a geographic information system (GIS) and the Kriging procedure, exposure to air pollution during the first trimester and the entire pregnancy was assessed for each woman according to her residential location. Logistic regression models with generalized estimating equation (GEE) approach were used to evaluate the adjusted risk for congenital malformations. Results: In the study cohort increased concentrations of PM10 and NOx pollutants in the entire pregnancy were associated with slightly increased risk for congenital malformations: OR 1.06(95% CI, 1.01-1.11) for 10 mu g/m(3) increase in PM10, and OR 1.03(95% CI, 1.01-1.04) for 10 ppb increase in NOR. Specific malformations were evident in the circulatory system (for PM10 and NOx exposure) and genital organs (for NOx exposure). SO2 and O-3 pollutants were not significantly associated with increased risk for congenital malformations. In the ART group higher concentrations of SO2 and O-3 in entire pregnancy were associated (although not significantly) with an increased risk for congenital malformations: OR 1.06 (95% CI, 0.96-1.17) for 1 ppb increase in SO2 and OR 1.15(95% CI, 0.69-1.91) for 10 ppb increase in O-3. Conclusions: Exposure to higher levels of PM10 and NOx during pregnancy was associated with an increased risk for congenital malformations. Specific malformations were evident in the circulatory system and genital organs. Among ART pregnancies possible adverse association of SO2 and O-3 exposure was also observed. Further studies are warranted, including more accurate exposure assessment and a larger sample size for ART pregnancies, in order to confirm these findings. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Of 1903 animal engravings, 1514 contained sufficient detail to allow identification with confidence. In addition, the stratigraphy of the engravings and the depiction of domesticates provide a broad chronological framework that allows a division into images created during the Holocene humid phase and animals represented after the onset of desert conditions. Despite the large sample size, only 16 animal species could be identified, which represents an extraordinarily narrow species spectrum. Comparison with the scarce faunal record of the Arabian Peninsula shows that all larger animals that are thought to have been present in the area were also depicted in the rock art. The contemporaneous presence of at least four large carnivores during the Holocene humid phase suggests that prey animals were abundant, and that the landscape consisted of a mosaic of habitats, potentially with thicker vegetation along the water courses of the wadis and more open vegetation in the landscape around them. Community Earth System Models (COSMOS) climate simulations show that Shuwaymis was at the northern edge of the African Summer Monsoon rainfall regime. It is therefore possible that Shuwaymis was ecologically connected with southwestern Arabia, and that an arid barrier remained in place to the north, restricting the dispersal of Levantine species into Arabia.",Arabian Peninsula; climate simulation; Holocene environment; human-environment interaction; prey biomass; rock art

Serum PTH concentration was negatively correlated with serum 25OHD concentration in boys, but negatively correlated with calcium intake rather than serum 25OHD in girls. In contrast, the increment in calcaneal stiffness as a result of elevation of serum 25OHD was higher in girls than in boys. As vitamin D deficiency is common in Japanese adolescents, it was estimated that intakes of ≥12 and ≥14 μg/day vitamin D would be required to reach 25OHD concentrations of 50 nmol/L in boys and girls, respectively. Moreover, the results of the present study indicate that vitamin D deficiency has a greater association with calcaneal stiffness in girls than in boys.",25-Hydroxyvitamin D; Adolescent; Bone mineral density; Parathyroid hormone; Vitamin D.
806,A fast approach to deformable surface 3D tracking,"Wang, Chenhao; Shen, Shuhan; Liu, Yuncai","Deformable surface 3D tracking is a severely under-constrained problem and great efforts have been made to solve it. A recent state-of-the-art approach solves this problem by formulating it as a second order cone programming (SOCP) problem. However, one drawback of this approach is that it is time-consuming. In this paper, we propose an effective method for 3D deformable surface tracking. First, we formulate the deformable surface tracking problem as a linear programming (LP) problem. Then, we solve the LP problem with an algorithm which converges superlinearly rather than bisection algorithm whose convergence speed is linear. Our experimental studies on synthetic and real data have demonstrated the proposed method can not only reliably recover 3D structures of surfaces but also run faster than the state-of-the-art method.

807,Reversibility-oriented secret image sharing mechanism with steganography and authentication based on code division multiplexing,"Xie, Xiao-Zhu; Chang, Chin-Chen; Lin, Chia-Chen","In this study, the authors propose a (n,n) secret image sharing scheme based on code division multiplexing. The secret data are decoded into n host images to generate n meaningful shares using n encoding codes. Any two of encoding codes are orthogonal to each other. If and only if with n shares together, the secret data can be retrieved successfully, and the host images can be recovered completely. The merits of the proposed scheme are summarised as follows: (i) the meaningful shares generated by the proposed scheme can successfully avoid suspicions by malicious attackers during transmission; (ii) the secret data can be losslessly retrieved and the host images can be recovered completely; (iii) the generated shares can be verified so that the forged shares can be detected; (iv) an arbitrary number of shares can be generated to meet the requirement of practical applications; and (v) moreover, n host images can be either identical or different. The experimental results and analyses show that the proposed scheme can provide high security and outperform state-of-the-art secret sharing schemes.",data encapsulation; image coding; cryptography; steganography; encoding; reversibility-oriented secret image sharing mechanism; steganography; authentication; secret image sharing scheme; secret data; n host images; n encoding codes; n shares; generated shares; forged shares; code division multiplexing; state-of-the-art secret sharing schemes

809,Knowledge distillation methods for efficient unsupervised adaptation across multiple domains,"Nguyen-Meidine, Le Thanh; Belal, Atif; Kiran, Madhu; Dolz, Jose; Blais-Morin, Louis-Antoine; Granger, Eric","Beyond the complexity of CNNs that require training on large annotated datasets, the domain shift between design and operational data has limited the adoption of CNNs in many real-world applications. For instance, in person re-identification, videos are captured over a distributed set of cameras with non-overlapping viewpoints. The shift between the source (e.g. lab setting) and target (e.g. cameras) domains may lead to a significant decline in recognition accuracy. Additionally, state-of-the-art CNNs may not be suitable for such real-time applications given their computational requirements. Although several techniques have recently been proposed to address domain shift problems through unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA), or to accelerate/compress CNNs through knowledge distillation (KD), we seek to simultaneously adapt and compress CNNs to generalize well across multiple target domains. In this paper, we propose a progressive KD approach for unsupervised single target DA (STDA) and multi-target DA (MTDA) of CNNs. Our method for KD-STDA adapts a CNN to a single target domain by distilling from a larger teacher CNN, trained on both target and source domain data in order to maintain its consistency with a common representation. This method is extended to address MTDA problems, where multiple teachers are used to distill multiple target domain knowledge to a common student CNN. A different target domain is assigned to each teacher model for UDA, and they alternatively distill their knowledge to the student model to preserve specificity of each target, instead of directly combining the knowledge from each teacher using fusion methods. Our proposed approach is compared against state-of-the-art methods for compression and STDA of CNNs on the Office31 and ImageClef-DA image classification datasets. It is also compared against stateof-the-art methods for MTDA on Digits, Office31, and OfficeHome. In both settings ? KD-STDA and KD-MTDA ? results indicate that our approach can achieve the highest level of accuracy across target domains, while requiring a comparable or lower CNN complexity. ? 2021 Published by Elsevier B.V.",Deep learning; Convolutional NNs; Knowledge distillation; Unsupervised domain adaptation; CNN acceleration and compression
810,Identifying Autism Spectrum Disorder With Multi-Site fMRI via Low-Rank Domain Adaptation,"Wang, Mingliang; Zhang, Daoqiang; Huang, Jiashuang; Yap, Pew-Thian; Shen, Dinggang; Liu, Mingxia","Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder that is characterized by a wide range of symptoms. Identifying biomarkers for accurate diagnosis is crucial for early intervention of ASD. While multi-site data increase sample size and statistical power, they suffer from inter-site heterogeneity. To address this issue, we propose a multi-site adaption framework via low-rank representation decomposition (maLRR) for ASD identification based on functional MRI (fMRI). The main idea is to determine a common low-rank representation for data from the multiple sites, aiming to reduce differences in data distributions. Treating one site as a target domain and the remaining sites as source domains, data from these domains are transformed (i.e., adapted) to a common space using low-rank representation. To reduce data heterogeneity between the target and source domains, data from the source domains are linearly represented in the common space by those from the target domain. We evaluated the proposed method on both synthetic and real multi-site fMRI data for ASD identification. The results suggest that our method yields superior performance over several state-of-the-art domain adaptation methods.",Functional magnetic resonance imaging; Diseases; Data models; Sparse matrices; Matrix decomposition; Medical diagnosis; Domain adaptation; low-rank representation; multi-site data; autism spectrum disorder; fMRI

For those individuals where infection leads to disease, the developing parasite is partially controlled by host immunity. In infected humans, the type of immune response developed by the host accounts for the subsequent trichotomy concerning the parasite development: (i) seroconversion proving infection, but lack of any hepatic lesion indicating the failure of the parasite to establish and further develop within the liver; or resistance as shown by the presence of fully calcified lesions; (ii) controlled susceptibility as found in the ""conventional"" alveolar echinococcosis (AE) patients who experience clinical signs and symptoms approximately 5-15 years after infection, and (iii) uncontrolled hyperproliferation of the metacestode due to an impaired immune response (AIDS or other immunodeficiencies). Immunomodulation of host immunity toward anergy seems to be triggered by parasite metabolites. Beside immunomodulating IL-10, TGFβ-driven regulatory T cells have been shown to play a crucial role in the parasite-modulated progressive course of AE.

813,Archer: A History-Based Global Routing Algorithm,"Ozdal, Muhammet Mustafa; Wong, Martin D. F.","Global routing is an important step in the physical design process. In this paper, we propose a new global routing algorithm Archer, which resolves some of the most common problems with the state-of-the-art global routers. It is known that concurrent global routing algorithms are typically too expensive to be applied on today's large designs, which may contain up to a million nets. On the other hand, iterative rip-up and reroute (RNR)-based algorithms are susceptible to getting stuck in local optimal solutions. In this paper, we propose an RNR-based global routing algorithm that guides the routing iterations out of local optima through effective usage of congestion histories. We also focus on the problem of how to enable a smooth tradeoff between seemingly conflicting objectives of overflow and wirelength minimization. Furthermore, we propose a Lagrangian relaxation-based bounded-length min-cost topology improvement algorithm that enables Steiner trees to change dynamically for the purpose of congestion optimization. Our experiments on public benchmarks show the effectiveness of Archer compared to other state-of-the-art global routers.",Congestion optimization; global routing; Lagrangian relaxation; Steiner tree optimization
814,Embodied mathematical pedagogy to liberate racialized and multilingual bodies,"Shimeng Liu,Miwa Aoki Takeuchi,Shimeng Liu,Miwa Aoki Takeuchi","When language is defined narrowly in mathematics classrooms, racially and linguistically minoritized students in classrooms could be systematically positioned as ""learners of deficiency."" Recent scholarship calls for expanding the notion of language to emphasize embodied expression of mathematical ideas. Taking a critical perspective to understand racialized experiences of using languages in disciplinary learning spaces, this article proposes the reconceptualization of embodiment as a language for racialized multilingual learners. This study was conducted in a Grade 1 classroom in a linguistically and racially diverse school in Canada. Through a series of professional development sessions, we worked with an experienced teacher to redesign the normalized and institutionalized pedagogy toward greater mobility of racialized multilingual learners' bodies, which was intertwined with their intellectual liberation. Focusing on the spatiality of pedagogy, the previously restrictive areas in the school were transformed into a place that augments embodied expression of mathematical ideas and agentive participation of minoritized learners. The analysis focused on the embodied discourse that participating racialized multilingual students used to actively engage in mathematical discussion. Our findings show that the designed pedagogy, characterized by the spatial and temporal expansion of the learning environment, offered more spaces for uncertainty and spontaneity with the decreased control of the teacher as an explicator. Our article furthers anti-colonial approaches to understand the intersection of racialized bodies and language in mathematics education.",Discourse; Early mathematics learning; Embodiment; Racialized multilingual learners.
815,Lookahead adversarial learning for near real-time semantic segmentation,"Jamali-Rad, Hadi; Szabo, Attila","Semantic segmentation is one of the most fundamental problems in computer vision with significant impact on a wide variety of applications. Adversarial learning is shown to be an effective approach for improving semantic segmentation quality by enforcing higher-level pixel correlations and structural information. However, state-of-the-art semantic segmentation models cannot be easily plugged into an adversarial setting because they are not designed to accommodate convergence and stability issues in adversarial networks. We bridge this gap by building a conditional adversarial network with a state-of-the-art segmentation model (DeepLabv3+) at its core. To battle the stability issues, we introduce a novel lookahead adversarial learning (LoAd) approach with an embedded label map aggregation module. We focus on semantic segmentation models that run fast at inference for near real-time field applications. Through extensive experimentation, we demonstrate that the proposed solution can alleviate divergence issues in an adversarial semantic segmentation setting and results in considerable performance improvements (+5% in some classes) on the baseline for three standard datasets.",Semantic segmentation; Conditional adversarial training; Computer vision; Deep learning
816,Pooling the Convolutional Layers in Deep ConvNets for Video Action Recognition,"Zhao, Shichao; Liu, Yanbin; Han, Yahong; Hong, Richang; Hu, Qinghua; Tian, Qi","Deep ConvNets have shown their good performance in image classification tasks. However, there still remains problems in deep video representations for action recognition. On one hand, current video ConvNets are relatively shallow compared with image ConvNets, which limits their capability of capturing the complex video action information; on the other hand, temporal information of videos is not properly utilized to pool and encode the video sequences. Toward these issues, in this paper we utilize two state-of-the-art ConvNets, i.e., the very deep spatial net (VGGNet [1]) and the temporal net from Two-Stream ConvNets [2], for action representation. The convolutional layers and the proposed new layer, called frame-diff layer, are extracted and pooled with two temporal pooling strategies: Trajectory pooling and Line pooling. The pooled local descriptors are then encoded with vector of locally aggregated descriptors (VLAD) [3] to form the video representations. In order to verify the effectiveness of the proposed framework, we conduct experiments on UCF101 and HMDB51 data sets. It achieves accuracy of 92.08% on UCF101, which is the state-of-the-art, and the accuracy of 65.62% on HMDB51, which is comparable to the state-of-the-art. In addition, we propose the new Line pooling strategy, which can speed up the extraction of feature and achieve the comparable performance of the Trajectory pooling.",ConvNets; pooling strategy; video representations; feature fusion

The sophisticated natural language processing and speech recognition employed by VAs enables users to interact with them conversationally, almost as they would with another human. To service user voice requests, VAs transmit large amounts of data to their vendors; these data are processed and stored in the Cloud. The potential data security and privacy issues involved in this process provided the motivation to examine the current state of the art in VA research. In this study, we identify peer-reviewed literature that focuses on security and privacy concerns surrounding these assistants, including current trends in addressing how voice assistants are vulnerable to malicious attacks and worries that the VA is recording without the user's knowledge or consent. The findings show that not only are these worries manifold, but there is a gap in the current state of the art, and no current literature reviews on the topic exist. This review sheds light on future research directions, such as providing solutions to perform voice authentication without an external device, and the compliance of VAs with privacy regulations.",virtual assistant; data security; privacy; GDPR; internet of things; smart homes
819,Discrepancy-Guided Domain-Adaptive Data Augmentation,"Gao, Jian; Hua, Yang; Hu, Guosheng; Wang, Chi; Robertson, Neil M.","Data augmentation has been observed playing a crucial role in achieving better generalization in many machine learning tasks, especially in unsupervised domain adaptation (DA). It is particularly effective on visual object recognition tasks as images are high-dimensional with an enormous range of variations that can be simulated. Existing data augmentation techniques, however, are not explicitly designed to address the differences between different domains. Expert knowledge about the data is required, as well as manual efforts in finding the optimal parameters. In this article, we propose a novel domain-adaptive augmentation method by making use of a state-of-the-art style transfer method and domain discrepancy measurement. Specifically, we measure the discrepancy between source and target domains, and use it as a guide to augment the original source samples using style transferred source-to-target samples. The proposed domain-adaptive augmentation method is data and model agnostic that can be easily incorporated with state-of-the-art DA algorithms. We show empirically that, by using this domain-adaptive augmentation, we are able to gradually reduce the discrepancy between the source and target samples, and further boost the adaptation performance using different DA algorithms on three popular domain adaption datasets.",Training; Task analysis; Semantics; Benchmark testing; Reliability; Measurement; Manuals; Data augmentation; domain discrepancy; style transfer; unsupervised domain adaptation (DA)

We formulate a novel problem to minimize the FECF while keeping the system queues stable, by jointly optimizing the offloading probabilities at the relays and the capacities of the virtual machines at the HN. We prove that the problem is a multi-convex optimization problem and propose an effective solution method by alternating optimization. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the different variants of the proposed scheme in the scenarios with server-less and server-empowered relays and provide important insights regarding the fairness and efficiency in terms of the ART.",Task analysis; Subspace constraints; Relays; Servers; Delays; Computer architecture; Ad hoc networks; Mobile edge computing; buffer-aided relaying; task offloading; multi-convex optimization

However, the higher performance always comes with the deeper layers which also brings larger numbers of network operations and parameters that make it hard to implement in practice. In our work, a lightly super-resolution, named Mobile Share- Source Network (MSSN), is purposed to address these practical issues. In MSSN, a high-efficiency block, the mobile adaptive weighted residual unit, is designed to fulfill the need for the reduction in both parameters and the Mult-Adds while maintaining the performance with importing the deep separable convolution. Moreover, it brings into the Adaptive Weighted Share-Source Skip Connection, getting abundant information from the shallow layer which helps reconstruct better images. The experimental results show that our network has fewer numbers of parameters and operations than the state-of-the-art lightweight network while maintaining high reconstruction quality comparing with many state-of-the-art super-resolution methods in terms of both peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and structural similarity index metrics (SSIM).",Super-resolution; depthwise separable convolution; adaptive weighted module; lightweight network

Although it is known that C3aR is protective in several models of acute bacterial infections, the role for C3aR in chronic infection is largely unknown. Here we show that C3aR is protective in experimental chronic pyelonephritis. Global C3aR deficient (C3ar-/- ) mice had higher renal bacterial load, more pronounced renal histological lesions, increased renal apoptotic cell accumulation, tissue inflammation and extracellular matrix deposition following renal infection with uropathogenic E. coli (UPEC) strain IH11128, compared to WT control mice. Myeloid C3aR deficient (Lyz2-C3ar-/- ) mice exhibited a similar disease phenotype to global C3ar-/- mice. Pharmacological treatment with a C3aR agonist reduced disease severity in experimental chronic pyelonephritis. Furthermore, macrophages of C3ar-/- mice exhibited impaired ability to phagocytose UPEC. Our data clearly demonstrate a protective role for C3aR against experimental chronic pyelonephritis, macrophage C3aR plays a major role in the protection, and C3aR is necessary for phagocytosis of UPEC by macrophages. Our observation that C3aR agonist curtailed the pathology suggests a therapeutic potential for activation of C3aR in chronic infection.",C3aR; chronic inflammation; chronic pyelonephritis; persistent infection; phagocytosis; renal fibrosis.

The adopted technique is facile and environmentally friendly for the production of CDs with in situ PVP passivation. Physicochemical characterization of CDs is performed using various spectroscopic and microscopic techniques. The study reveals the formation of nitrogen-doped spherical PPCCDs with an average hydrodynamic size of ∼ 4.9 nm. It is also evident that there is modulation in optical properties and quantum efficiency as a result of PVP passivation. The study further demonstrates their suitability in biological environments as observed by pH stability, photostability, and cytocompatibility results. PPCCDs have shown significant antioxidant activity against DPPH (EC50: 57 µg/mL), suppression of superoxide anion radical (EC50: 53 µg/mL), and an efficient catalytic activity towards degradation of Rhodamine-B (Rh-B) dye.

We compare the PGPR effect on plants performances among different groups of controls and treatments. Our results reveal that PGPR enables plants to restore themselves from drought-stressed to near a well-watered state, and that C4 plants recover better from drought stress than C3 plants. Furthermore, PGPR is more effective underdrought than well-watered conditions in increasing plant biomass, enhancing photosynthesis and inhibiting oxidant damage, and the responses of C4 plants to the PGPR effect was stronger than that of C3 plants under drought conditions.

It is also present in a subset of Alzheimer's disease cases. Recently, few reports showed TDP-43 changes in cognitively normal elderly. In Caucasians, TDP-43 proteinopathy independently correlate with cognitive decline. However, it is challenging to establish direct links between cognitive and/or neuropsychiatric symptoms and protein inclusions in neurodegenerative diseases because individual cognitive reserves modify the threshold for clinical disease expression. Cognitive reserve is influenced by demographic, environmental and genetic factors. We investigated the relationships between demographic, clinical and neuropathological variables and TDP-43 proteinopathy in a large multiethnic sample of cognitively normal elderly. TDP-43 proteinopathy was identified in 10.5%, independently associated with older age (P = 0.03) and Asian ethnicity (P = 0.002). Asians showed a higher prevalence of TDP-43 proteinopathy than Caucasians, even after adjustment for sex, age, Braak stage and schooling (odds ratio = 3.50, confidence interval 1.41-8.69, P = 0.007). These findings suggested that Asian older adults may be protected from the clinical manifestation of brain TDP-43 proteinopathy.

829,Error Bounded Foreground and Background Modeling for Moving Object Detection in Satellite Videos,"Zhang, Junpeng; Jia, Xiuping; Hu, Jiankun","Detecting moving objects from ground-based videos is commonly achieved by using background subtraction (BS) techniques. Low-rank matrix decomposition inspires a set of state-of-the-art approaches for this task. It is integrated with structured sparsity regularization to achieve BS in the developed method of low-rank and structured sparse decomposition (LSD). However, when this method is applied to satellite videos where spatial resolution is poor and targets' contrast to the background is low, its performance is limited as the data no longer fit adequately either the foreground structure or the background model. In this article, we handle these unexplained data explicitly and address the moving target detection from space as one of the pioneering studies. We propose a new technique by extending the decomposition formulation with bounded errors, named Extended LSD (E-LSD). This formulation integrates low-rank background, structured sparse foreground, as well as their residuals in a matrix decomposition problem. Solving this optimization problem is challenging. We provide an effective solution by introducing an alternative treatment and adopting the direct extension of alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM).

As state-of-the-art editing approaches decompose an image into several layers in order to manipulate them, they propose a hierarchical multi-layer decomposition of graph signals that relies on morphological filtering. Since morphological filtering operators require a complete lattice, a dedicated approach for the morphological processing of vectorial data on graphs is used. By iterating the application of morphological filterings of decreasing sizes, the graph signal is decomposed into several detail layers, each capturing a given detail level. Editing applications such as abstraction, sharpness enhancement and tone mapping are shown to illustrate the benefits of the proposed approach.",image enhancement; filtering theory; mathematical morphology; image texture; graph theory; image colour analysis; morphological processing; editing applications; hierarchical morphological graph signal multilayer decomposition; editing signals; 2D colour images; 3D coloured meshes; state-of-the-art editing; morphological filtering operators

C.","The present paper deals with state of the art in Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) methods in offshore and marine structures. Most of the SHM methods have been developed for onshore infrastructures. Few works are available to implement SHM technologies in offshore and marine structures. This paper aims to fill this gap and highlight the challenges in implementing SHM methods in offshore and marine structures. The present work categorizes the available techniques for establishing SHM models in oil rigs, offshore wind turbine structures, subsea systems, vessels, pipelines etc. Besides, the capabilities of the proposed ideas in the recent publications are classified into three main categories: a) the Model-Based, b) the Vibration-Based, and c) the Digital Twin methods. Recently developed novel signal processing and machine learning algorithms have been reviewed, and their abilities have been discussed. Developed methods in Vision-Based and Population-Based approaches have also been presented and discussed.

832,Hybrid SDN evolution: A comprehensive survey of the state-of-the-art,"Khorsandroo, Sajad; Gallego Sanchez, Adrian; Tosun, Ali Saman; Arco, Jm; Doriguzzi-Corin, Roberto","Software-Defined Networking (SDN) is an evolutionary networking paradigm which has been adopted by large network and cloud providers, among which are Tech Giants. However, embracing a new and futuristic paradigm as an alternative to well-established and mature legacy networking paradigm requires a lot of time along with considerable financial resources and technical expertise. Consequently, many enterprises cannot afford it. A compromise solution then is a hybrid networking environment (a.k.a. Hybrid SDN (hSDN)) in which SDN functionalities are leveraged while existing traditional network infrastructures are acknowledged. Recently, hSDN has been seen as a viable networking solution for a diverse range of businesses and organizations. Accordingly, the body of literature on hSDN research has improved remarkably. On this account, we present this paper as a comprehensive state-of-the-art survey which expands upon hSDN from many different perspectives.",Software-Defined Networking (SDN); Hybrid SDN; Network architecture; Network security; Network management; Traffic engineering; Implementation and deployment

The study included 50 newly diagnosed treatment-naïve CLL patients and 50 age and sex matched healthy controls. NOTCH1 c.7541-7542delCT mutation was detected using High-resolution melting (HRM) assay and direct Sanger sequencing. Outcome parameters included progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). NOTCH1 c.7541-7542delCT mutation was detected in 5 (10.0%) of CLL patients. No controls had NOTCH1 c.7541-7542delCT mutation. Similar results were obtained by direct Sanger sequencing yielding a sensitivity and specificity of 100.0% for HRM in detection of NOTCH1 c.7541-7542delCT mutation in the studied patients. In univariate analysis, predictors of OS included Trisomy 12, high LDH, presence of NOTCH1 c.7541-7542delCT mutation and lack of CR. In multivariate analysis, only lack of CR was found as a significant predictor of OS. HRM analysis is a sensitive method for detection of NOTCH1 c.7541-7542delCT mutation in CLL patients. This mutation may be linked to poor disease prognosis.",Chronic lymphocytic leukemia; DNA sequencing; High-resolution melting analysis; NOTCH1 mutations; Prognosis.

The proposed approach is based on a novel coupled siamese neural network architecture and allows unified treatment of intra-and inter-modality similarity learning.

835,Single- and Mutiple-Shell Uniform Sampling Schemes for Diffusion MRI Using Spherical Codes,"Cheng, Jian; Shen, Dinggang; Yap, Pew-Thian; Basser, Peter J.","In diffusion MRI (dMRI), a good sampling scheme is important for efficient acquisition and robust reconstruction. Diffusion weighted signal is normally acquired on single or multiple shells in q-space. Signal samples are typically distributed uniformly on different shells to make them invariant to the orientation of structures within tissue, or the laboratory coordinate frame. The electrostatic energy minimization (EEM) method, originally proposed for single shell sampling scheme in dMRI, was recently generalized to multi-shell schemes, called generalized EEM (GEEM). GEEM has been successfully used in the human connectome project. However, EEM does not directly address the goal of optimal sampling, i.e., achieving large angular separation between sampling points. In this paper, we propose a more natural formulation, called spherical code (SC), to directly maximize the minimal angle between different samples in single or multiple shells. We consider not only continuous problems to design single or multiple shell sampling schemes, but also discrete problems to uniformly extract sub-sampled schemes from an existing single or multiple shell scheme, and to order samples in an existing scheme. We propose five algorithms to solve the above problems, including an incremental SC (ISC), a sophisticated greedy algorithm called iterative maximum overlap construction (IMOC), an 1-Opt greedy method, a mixed integer linear programming method, and a constrained non-linear optimization method. To our knowledge, this is the first work to use the SC formulation for single or multiple shell sampling schemes in dMRI. Experimental results indicate that SC methods obtain larger angular separation and better rotational invariance than the state-of-the-art EEM and GEEM. The related codes and a tutorial have been released in DMRITool.",Sampling; q-space; multiple shells; uniform spherical sampling; diffusion MRI; spherical codes
836,Online supervised hashing,"Cakir, Fatih; Bargal, Sarah Adel; Sclaroff, Stan","Fast nearest neighbor search is becoming more and more crucial given the advent of large-scale data in many computer vision applications. Hashing approaches provide both fast search mechanisms and compact index structures to address this critical need. In image retrieval problems where labeled training data is available, supervised hashing methods prevail over unsupervised methods. Most state-of-the-art supervised hashing approaches employ batch-learners. Unfortunately, batch-learning strategies may be inefficient when confronted with large datasets. Moreover, with batch-learners, it is unclear how to adapt the hash functions as the dataset continues to grow and new variations appear over time. To handle these issues, we propose OSH: an Online Supervised Hashing technique that is based on Error Correcting Output Codes. We consider a stochastic setting where the data arrives sequentially and our method learns and adapts its hashing functions in a discriminative manner. Our method makes no assumption about the number of possible class labels, and accommodates new classes as they are presented in the incoming data stream. In experiments with three image retrieval benchmarks, our method yields state-of-the-art retrieval performance as measured in Mean Average Precision, while also being orders-of-magnitude faster than competing batch methods for supervised hashing. Also, our method significantly outperforms recently introduced online hashing solutions. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

837,A Dynamic Mode Decomposition Based Edge Detection Method for Art Images,"Bi, Chongke; Yuan, Ye; Zhang, Ronghui; Xiang, Yiqing; Wang, Yuehuan; Zhang, Jiawan","Edge detection is a widely used feature extraction method in various fields, such as image processing, computer vision, machine vision, and so forth. However, it is still a challenging task to extract edges from art images, due to the false edge, shadow, and double lines of art images. In this paper, we propose a dynamic mode decomposition algorithm (DMD) based method for edge detection of art images. This is achieved by proposing a new color space based denoise method to deal with the shadow issue. Then, the false edge and double lines can be resolved by employing DMD method, which can be used to extract sparse features from the denoised images. Here, the sparse features have been enhanced by a new designed eight direction gradient operator. Finally, the effectiveness of our method will be demonstrated through detecting the edges of three classical types of art images (Comic, Oil Painting, and Printmaking).",Image processing; image edge detection; filtering; optical filters; optical engineering
838,The mouse allantois: new insights at the embryonic-extraembryonic interface,"Karen M Downs,Karen M Downs","During the early development of Placentalia, a distinctive projection emerges at the posterior embryonic-extraembryonic interface of the conceptus; its fingerlike shape presages maturation into the placental umbilical cord, whose major role is to shuttle fetal blood to and from the chorion for exchange with the mother during pregnancy. Until recently, the biology of the cord's vital vascular anlage, called the body stalk/allantois in humans and simply the allantois in rodents, has been largely unknown. Here, new insights into the development of the mouse allantois are featured, from its origin and mechanism of arterial patterning through its union with the chorion. Key to generating the allantois and its critical functions are the primitive streak and visceral endoderm, which together are sufficient to create the entire fetal-placental connection. Their newly discovered roles at the embryonic-extraembryonic interface challenge conventional wisdom, including the physical limits of the primitive streak, its function as sole purveyor of mesoderm in the mouse, potency of visceral endoderm, and the putative role of the allantois in the germ line. With this working model of allantois development, understanding a plethora of hitherto poorly understood orphan diseases in humans is now within reach.

839,State of the art of thermal storage for demand-side management,"Arteconi, A.; Hewitt, N. J.; Polonara, F.","Thermal energy storage (TES) is widely recognized as a means to integrate renewable energies into the electricity production mix on the generation side, but its applicability to the demand side is also possible. In recent decades, TES systems have demonstrated a capability to shift electrical loads from high-peak to off-peak hours, so they have the potential to become a powerful instrument in demand-side management programs (DSM). Thermal storage is a technology that ensures energy security, efficiency and environmental quality. Of particular interest are applications where TES systems help manage the mismatch between availability of renewable electricity and the demand for electricity in buildings where hot water, heating and cooling are delivered by heat pumps and air conditioning for example. Thus this paper demonstrates the state of the art of present applications of thermal storage for demand-side management. A particular focus of this work is the attention paid to the characteristics of DSM and their relationship to different thermal storage systems. If TES effectiveness for the abovementioned applications is demonstrated, TES devices have a small percentage of the potential market. Therefore challenges and guidelines for a development plan are suggested. (c) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Remote sensing images often involve complex spatial relationships due to the ground relief variations and imaging viewpoint changes. Therefore, using a pre-defined geometrical model will probably lead to inferior matching accuracy. In order to find good correspondences, we propose a simple yet efficient deep learning network, which we term the x201C;local structure visualization-attentionx201D; network (LSV-ANet). Our main aim is to transform outlier detection into a dynamic visual similarity evaluation. Specifically, we first map the local spatial distribution into a regular grid as descriptor LSV, and then customized a spatial SCale Attention (SCA) module and a spatial STructure Attention (STA) module, which explicitly allows structure manipulation and scale selection of LSV within the network. Finally, the embedded SCA and STA deduce optimal LSV for solving feature matching task by training the LSV-ANet end-to-end. In order to demonstrate the robustness and universality of our LSV-ANet, extensive experiments on various real image pairs for general feature matching are conducted and compared against eight state-of-the-art methods. The experiment results demonstrate the superiority of our method over state of the art.",Feature extraction; Visualization; Task analysis; Deep learning; Strain; Estimation; Adaptation models; Attention network; deep learning; feature matching; image registration; mismatch removal; remote sensing

Herein, we rationally designed a microvesicle-inspired oxygen-delivering polyfluorocarbon nanosystem loading DiIC18(5) and halofuginone (M-FDH) with prominent capacity of improving tumor oxygenation and intratumor distribution, synergizing radiation to disrupt tumor stroma and boost antitumor immunity for combinational cancer therapy. M-FDH produced a 10.98-fold enhancement of tumor oxygenation and caused efficient production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) upon radiation. M-FDH + X ray treatment resulted in notable DNA damages, over 90% elimination of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) and major components of extracellular matrix, significant enhancement of tumoricidal CD3+CD8+ T cells, and profound elimination of suppressive immune cells in 4T1 tumors. The therapeutic benefits of M-FDH + X ray on suppressing tumor growth were confirmed in two murine tumor models.

Therefore, starting from an evolutionary system of carbon emissions, this paper studies the evolution of the system, establishes a grey model of the system, and expands the modeling structure of this model. The modeling mechanism of the classical feedforward neural network model is organically combined with the function of the external influencing factors of carbon emissions, and the grey model of the carbon emission dynamic system is established with a neural network. Then, the properties of the model are studied, the parameters of the model are optimized, and the modeling steps are obtained. Finally, the validity of the model is analyzed by using the carbon emissions of Beijing from 2009 to 2018. The results of the four cases show that the simulation and prediction errors of the new model are all less than 10%, and case 1 shows the best results of 1.56% and 2.07%, respectively, which are used to predict the carbon dioxide emissions in the next 5 years in Beijing.

844,A pyramid multi-level face descriptor: application to kinship verification,"Moujahid, A.; Dornaika, F.","Texture descriptors such as Local Binary Pattern (LBP), Local Phase Quantization (LPQ), and Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) have been widely used for face image analysis. This work introduces a novel framework for image-based kinship verification able to efficiently combine local and global facial information extracted from diverse descriptors. The proposed scheme relies on two main points: (1) we model the face images using a Pyramid Multi-level (PML) representation where local descriptors are extracted from several blocks at different resolution scales; (2) we compute the covariance (second-order statistics) between diverse local features characterizing each individual block in the PML representation. This gives rise to a face descriptor with two interesting properties: (i) thanks to the PML representation, scales and face parts are explicitly encoded in the final descriptor without having to detect the facial landmarks; (ii) the covariance descriptor encodes spatial features of any type allowing the integration of several state-of-the-art texture and color features. Experiments conducted on three public kinship databases show that the proposed descriptor can outperform many state-of-the-art kinship verification algorithms and descriptors including those that are based on deep Convolutional Neural Nets.",Kinship verification; Face descriptor; Multi-scale representation; Covariance descriptor; Feature selection; Classifier

Provision of free antiretroviral therapy (ART) for eligible persons living with HIV (PLHA) has been scaled up significantly both in terms of facilities for treatment and number of beneficiaries. This study aimed at describing the profile of HIV/AIDS patients on ART from a tertiary-care hospital and to explore the factors associated with treatment-seeking behaviour, family support, and perceptions regarding HIV and ART. This is a descriptive study conducted at the ART centre in a tertiary-care hospital in Puducherry. Study population consisted of 130 HIV-positive patients aged more than 18 years on free firstline ART for at least 6 months. Data on sociodemographic details, clinical details, treatment-seeking behaviour, family support, and perceptions regarding HIV and ART were collected using a pretested questionnaire. Data are presented as percentages. In total, 130 patients on ART for at least 6 months were included in the study-61% were males (n= 79), 39% were females (n= 51); half of them belonged to the age-group of 36-50 years. Half of the participants were diagnosed to have HIV/AIDS between 1 and 3 year(s); two-thirds had one or more co-infection(s). The majority were aware of the side-effects of ART. After advice to start ART, there was a delay in starting treatment in one-fifth of the subjects due to depression, fear of stigma, disclosure to family, and side-effects. More than two-thirds of the patients travelled more than 30 km distance. Families of HIV-positive subjects were supportive in accompanying to the ART centre, collecting drugs, reminders to take medication, and motivation to complete the treatment. Alcohol (50%) and tobacco consumption (39%) was common among the subjects. Half of the respondents stated stigma, death, and pain as the main fears, and all of them stated high levels of trust and rapport with their doctors. This study reveals several positive aspects among ART beneficiaries.

Alleles of the NLR pair CHS3/CSA1 form three clades. The clade 1 sensor CHS3 contains an integrated domain (ID) with homology to regulatory domains, which is lacking in clades 2 and 3. In this study, we defined two cell-death regulatory modes for CHS3/CSA1 pairs. One is mediated by ID domain on clade 1 CHS3, and the other relies on CHS3/CSA1 pairs from all clades detecting perturbation of an associated pattern-recognition receptor (PRR) co-receptor. Our data support the hypothesis that an ancestral Arabidopsis CHS3/CSA1 pair gained a second recognition specificity and regulatory mechanism through ID acquisition while retaining its original specificity as a ""guard"" against PRR co-receptor perturbation. This likely comes with a cost, since both ID and non-ID alleles of the pair persist in diverse Arabidopsis populations through balancing selection.",BAK1; CHS3; CSA1; co-evolution; guard hypothesis; paired NLR; plant immune system; specialization.

However, similar to other neural networks, they tend to suffer from a high computational cost to perform training. Reservoir computing (RC) is an effective way to define neural networks that are very efficient to train, often obtaining comparable predictive performance with respect to the fully trained counterparts. Different proposals of reservoir graph neural networks have been proposed in the literature. However, their predictive performances are still slightly below the ones of fully trained graph neural networks on many benchmark datasets, arguably because of the oversmoothing problem that arises when iterating over the graph structure in the reservoir computation. In this work, we aim to reduce this gap defining a multiresolution reservoir graph neural network (MRGNN) inspired by graph spectral filtering. Instead of iterating on the nonlinearity in the reservoir and using a shallow readout function, we aim to generate an explicit k-hop unsupervised graph representation amenable for further, possibly nonlinear, processing. Experiments on several datasets from various application areas show that our approach is extremely fast and it achieves in most of the cases comparable or even higher results with respect to state-of-the-art approaches.",Convolution; Reservoirs; Training; Computational modeling; Neural networks; Graph neural networks; Standards; Deep learning; graph neural network; machine learning on graphs; reservoir computing (RC); structured data

Mixing is therefore of great practical importance. Millireactors enable comparatively high flow rates at moderate pressure drops and are thus well suited for production purposes. In this work, the mixing performance of the millistructured reactor ART PR37 is investigated using the Bourne method. Four plate types with similar meandering, converging/ diverging process channels, but different hydraulic diameters have been studied over a wide range of Reynolds numbers. Mixing times have been calculated using two different mixing models, the IEM model and a recently introduced modified incorporation model. Mixing times were found to be less than 0.1 second for Reynolds numbers exceeding 150. For higher Reynolds numbers, mixing times in the range of 0.02 to 0.03 s are achievable without prohibitively high pressure drops.

Similar metabolic changes are observed with age, suggesting that chronic jet lag and accelerated cell aging are intimately related, but the association remains to be determined. We addressed whether jet lag induces metabolic and cell aging impairments in young grass rats (2-3 mo old), using control old grass rats (12-18 mo old) as an aging reference. Desynchronized young and control old subjects had impaired glucose tolerance (+60 and +280%) when compared with control young animals. Despite no significant variation in liver DNA damage, shorter telomeres were characterized, not only in old animal liver cells (-18%), but also at an intermediate level in desynchronized young rats (-9%). The same pattern was found for deacetylase sirtuin (SIRT)-1 (-57 and -29%), confirming that jet-lagged young rats have an intermediate aging profile. Our data indicate that an experimental circadian desynchronization in young animals is associated with a precocious aging profile based on 3 well-known markers, as well as a prediabetic phenotype.

Climate change, sea level rise, storms and tsunamis are the natural phenomena that affect the deltaic coasts in Southeast Asia in general and Vietnam in particular. The effects of these phenomena can be exacerbated by human activities such as mangrove deforestation, aquaculture and infrastructure development. Conversely, the low-lying coastal areas are important in the economic development of Southeast Asian countries. In the Vietnamese Mekong Delta, coastal areas have been affected by a number of factors, such as climate change, sea level rise, aquaculture, pollution and tourism-related activities in recent decades. The present study investigated shoreline changes, expansion of aquaculture ponds, soil salinity changes and salinity intrusion in the river systems along the coastal areas of Ben Tre Province in the Vietnamese Mekong Delta between 1998 and 2020 using satellite imagery and field data. Variations in erosion and accretion were found to be not unique along the coast of Ben Tre. There was a rapid expansion of aquaculture ponds between 1998 and 2015 and a slight decline since then. Soil salinity has been increased between 1998 and 2020; it is seen from recent satellite data that soil is becoming more saline in the inland areas of Ben Tre. Saltwater intrusion into the rivers of Ben Tre is considered associated with El Niño-La Niña conditions. It is suggested that reforestation of abandoned shrimp ponds in Ben Tre by mangrove vegetation can be effective as a bioshield against coastal hazards, such as sea level rise and shoreline erosion.",Coastal remote sensing; Coastal vegetation; Mekong Delta; Sea level rise; Shoreline erosion; Vietnamese coastline.

A number of techniques have been proposed to either conduct spatio-temporal mobility prediction or forecast the next-place. However, both produce diverse prediction performance for different users and display poor performance for some users. This paper focuses on investigating the effect of living habits on the models of spatio-temporal prediction and next-place prediction, and selects one from these two models for an individual to achieve effective mobility prediction at users' points of interest. Based on the hidden Markov model (HMM), a spatio-temporal predictor and a next-place predictor are proposed. Living habits are analyzed in terms of entropy, upon which users are clustered into distinct groups. With large-scale factual mobile data captured from a big city, we compare the proposed HMM-based predictors with existing state-of-the-art predictors and apply them to different user groups. The results demonstrate the robust performance of the two proposed mobility predictors, which outperform the state of the art for various user groups.",Big data; cellular data network; hidden Markov model (HMM); next-place prediction; spatio-temporal mobility prediction

Regarding base models, tree-based techniques are employed to acquire a balance between predictive accuracy and computational cost. In terms of ensemble selection, the proposed method can assign weights to base models dynamically according to the overfitting measure. Validated on five public datasets, the proposed approach is compared with several popular benchmark models and selection strategies on predictive accuracy and computational cost measures. For predictive accuracy, the proposed approach outperforms the benchmark models significantly in most cases based on the non-parametric significance test. It also performs marginally better than several state-of-the-art studies. Our proposal remains robust in several scenarios. In terms of computational cost, the proposed method provides acceptable performance and benefits from GPU acceleration considerably. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

856,A Computational Approach to Packet Classification,"Rashelbach, Alon; Rottenstreich, Ori; Silberstein, Mark","Multi-field packet classification is a crucial component in modern software-defined data center networks. To achieve high throughput and low latency, state-of-the-art algorithms strive to fit the rule lookup data structures into on-die caches; however, they do not scale well with the number of rules. We present a novel approach, NuevoMatch, which improves the memory scaling of existing methods. A new data structure, Range Query Recursive Model Index (RQ-RMI), is the key component that enables NuevoMatch to replace most of the accesses to main memory with model inference computations. We describe an efficient training algorithm that guarantees the correctness of the RQ-RMI-based classification. The use of RQ-RMI allows the rules to be compressed into neural networks that fit into the hardware cache. Further, it takes advantage of the growing support for fast neural network processing in modern CPUs, such as wide vector instructions, achieving a latency of tens of nanoseconds per lookup. Our evaluation using 500K multi-field rules from the standard ClassBench benchmark shows a geometric mean compression factor of 4.9x, 8x, and 82x, and average performance improvement of 2.4x, 2.6x, and 1.6x in throughput compared to CutSplit, NeuroCuts, and TupleMerge, all state-of-the-art algorithms.",Decision trees; Training; Throughput; Neural networks; Indexing; Partitioning algorithms; IEEE transactions; Packet classification; machine learning
857,Pipelines for HDR Video Coding Based on Luminance Independent Chromaticity Preprocessing,"Mahmalat, Samir; Aydin, Tunc Ozan; Smolic, Aljosa","We consider the chromaticity in high dynamic range (HDR) video coding and show the advantages of a constant luminance color space for encoding. For this, we introduce two constant luminance HDR video coding pipelines, which convert the source video to linear Y u' v'. A content dependent scaling of the chromaticity components serves as color quality parameter. This reduces perceivable color artifacts while remaining fully compatible with core High Efficiency Video Coding or other video coding standards. One of the pipelines further combines the scaling with a dedicated chromaticity transform to optimize the representation of the chromaticity components for encoding. We validate both pipelines with subjective user studies in addition to an objective comparison to the other state-of-the-art methods. The user studies show a significant improvement in perceived color quality at medium to high compression rates without sacrificing luminance quality compared with current standard coding pipelines. The objective evaluation suggests that both pipelines perform at least comparable to the current state-of-the-art methods.",Color transformation; gamut clipping; HDR; video coding
858,Driver attention prediction based on convolution and transformers,"Gou, Chao; Zhou, Yuchen; Li, Dan","In recent years, studying how drivers allocate their attention while driving is critical in achieving human-like cognitive ability for autonomous vehicles. And it has been an active topic in the community of human-machine augmented intelligence for self-driving. However, existing state-of-the-art methods for driver attention prediction are mainly built upon convolutional neural network (CNN) with local receptive field which has a limitation to capture the long-range dependencies. In this work, we propose a novel Attention prediction method based on CNN and Transformer which is termed as ACT-Net. In particular, CNN and Transformer are combined as a block which is further stacked to form the deep model. Through this design, both local and long-range dependencies are captured that both are crucial for driver attention prediction. Exhaustive comparison experiments over other state-of-the-art techniques conducted on widely used dataset of BDD-A and private collected data on BDD-X validate the effectiveness of the proposed ACT-Net.",Attention prediction; Transformer; Autonomous driving; Human-machine augmented intelligence

To close this gap, we discovered three novel metabolites via metabolite fingerprinting in Arabidopsis thaliana leaves after Pseudomonas infection and UV-C treatment. Exact mass information and fragmentation by tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) suggest a methylated derivative of NHP (MeNHP), an NHP-OGlc-hexosyl conjugate (NHP-OGlc-Hex), and an additional NHP-OGlc-derivative. All three compounds were formed in wild-type leaves but were not present in the NHP-deficient mutant fmo1-1. The identification of these novel NHP-based molecules was possible by a dual-infiltration experiment using a mixture of authentic NHP and D9-NHP standards for leaf infiltration followed by UV-C treatment. Interestingly, the signal intensity of MeNHP and other NHP-derived metabolites increased in ugt76b1-1 mutant plants. For MeNHP, we unequivocally determined the site of methylation at the carboxylic acid moiety. MeNHP application by leaf infiltration leads to the detection of a MeNHP-OGlc as well as NHP, suggesting MeNHP hydrolysis to NHP. This is in line with the observation that MeNHP infiltration is able to rescue the fmo1-1 susceptible phenotype against Hyaloperonospora arabidopsidis Noco 2. Together, these data suggest MeNHP as an additional storage or transport form of NHP.",Arabidopsis thaliana; N-hydroxy pipecolic acid methyl ester; UV stress; infection metabolism; non-targeted metabolomics; plant immunity; salicylic acid.

W.; Biffi, Carlo; de Marvao, Antonio; Doumou, Georgia; O'Regan, Declan P.; Rueckert, Daniel","Deep learning approaches have achieved state-of-the-art performance in cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) image segmentation. However, most approaches have focused on learning image intensity features for segmentation, whereas the incorporation of anatomical shape priors has received less attention. In this paper, we combine amulti-task deep learning approach with atlas propagation to develop a shape-refined bi-ventricular segmentation pipeline for short-axis CMR volumetric images. The pipeline first employs a fully convolutional network (FCN) that learns segmentation and landmark localization tasks simultaneously. The architecture of the proposed FCN uses a 2.5D representation, thus combining the computational advantage of 2D FCNs networks and the capability of addressing 3D spatial consistency without compromising segmentation accuracy. Moreover, a refinement step is designed to explicitly impose shape prior knowledge and improve segmentation quality. This step is effective for overcoming image artifacts (e.g., due to different breath-hold positions and large slice thickness), which preclude the creation of anatomically meaningful 3D cardiac shapes. The pipeline is fully automated, due to network's ability to infer landmarks, which are then used downstream in the pipeline to initialize atlas propagation. We validate the pipeline on 1831 healthy subjects and 649 subjects with pulmonary hypertension. Extensive numerical experiments on the two datasets demonstrate that our proposed method is robust and capable of producing accurate, high-resolution, and anatomically smooth bi-ventricular 3D models, despite the presence of artifacts in input CMR volumes.",Deep learning; bi-ventricular CMR segmentation; landmark localization; non-rigid registration; label fusion; multi-atlas segmentation; shape prior; cardiac artifacts

Moreover, batch normalization and Dice loss have been used successfully to stabilize and accelerate training. However, these networks are poorly calibrated i.e. they tend to produce overconfident predictions for both correct and erroneous classifications, making them unreliable and hard to interpret. In this paper, we study predictive uncertainty estimation in FCNs for medical image segmentation. We make the following contributions: 1) We systematically compare cross-entropy loss with Dice loss in terms of segmentation quality and uncertainty estimation of FCNs; 2) We propose model ensembling for confidence calibration of the FCNs trained with batch normalization and Dice loss; 3) We assess the ability of calibrated FCNs to predict segmentation quality of structures and detect out-of-distribution test examples. We conduct extensive experiments across three medical image segmentation applications of the brain, the heart, and the prostate to evaluate our contributions. The results of this study offer considerable insight into the predictive uncertainty estimation and out-of-distribution detection in medical image segmentation and provide practical recipes for confidence calibration. Moreover, we consistently demonstrate that model ensembling improves confidence calibration.",Uncertainty; Image segmentation; Calibration; Estimation; Biomedical imaging; Artificial neural networks; Bayes methods; Uncertainty estimation; confidence calibration; out-of-distribution detection; semantic segmentation; fully convolutional neural networks

J.; Johnston, Stephen J.","Classification of brain images obtained through functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) poses a serious challenge to pattern recognition and machine learning due to the extremely large feature-to-instance ratio. This calls for revision and adaptation of the current state-of-the-art classification methods. We investigate the suitability of the random subspace (RS) ensemble method for fMRI classification. RS samples from the original feature set and builds one (base) classifier on each subset. The ensemble assigns a class label by either majority voting or averaging of output probabilities. Looking for guidelines for setting the two parameters of the method-ensemble size and feature sample size-we introduce three criteria calculated through these parameters: usability of the selected feature sets, coverage of the set of ""important"" features, and feature set diversity. Optimized together, these criteria work toward producing accurate and diverse individual classifiers. RS was tested on three fMRI datasets from single-subject experiments: the Haxby et al. data (Haxby, 2001.) and two datasets collected in-house. We found that RS with support vector machines (SVM) as the base classifier outperformed single classifiers as well as some of the most widely used classifier ensembles such as bagging, AdaBoost, random forest, and rotation forest. The closest rivals were the single SVM and bagging of SVM classifiers. We use kappa-error diagrams to understand the success of RS.",Classifier ensembles; functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data analysis; multivariate methods; pattern recognition; random subspace (RS) method
863,VoxelMorph: A Learning Framework for Deformable Medical Image Registration,"Balakrishnan, Guha; Zhao, Amy; Sabuncu, Mert R.; Guttag, John; Dalca, Adrian, V","We present VoxelMorph, a fast learning-based framework for deformable, pairwise medical image registration. Traditional registration methods optimize an objective function for each pair of images, which can be time-consuming for large datasets or rich deformation models. In contrast to this approach and building on recent learning-based methods, we formulate registration as a function that maps an input image pair to a deformation field that aligns these images. We parameterize the function via a convolutional neural network and optimize the parameters of the neural network on a set of images. Given a new pair of scans, VoxelMorph rapidly computes a deformation field by directly evaluating the function. In this paper, we explore two different training strategies. In the first (unsupervised) setting, we train the model to maximize standard image matching objective functions that are based on the image intensities. In the second setting, we leverage auxiliary segmentations available in the training data. We demonstrate that the unsupervised model's accuracy is comparable to the state-of-the-art methods while operating orders of magnitude faster. We also show that VoxelMorph trained with auxiliary data improves registration accuracy at test time and evaluate the effect of training set size on registration. Our method promises to speed up medical image analysis and processing pipelines while facilitating novel directions in learning-based registration and its applications.

Germline testing alone cannot detect somatic BRCA1/2 pathogenic variants (sBRCAm), which is calculated based on the proportion of tumor BRCAm (tBRCAm) from tumor samples and gBRCAm. Homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) results mainly from genetic/epigenetic alterations in homologous recombination repair-related genes and can be evaluated by genomic instability status. In Japan, the prevalence of tBRCAm, sBRCAm, and HRD remains unclear. This multicenter, cross-sectional, observational study, CHaRacterIzing the croSs-secTional approach to invEstigate the prevaLence of tissue BRCA1/2 mutations in newLy diagnosEd advanced ovarian cancer patients (CHRISTELLE), evaluated the prevalence of tBRCAm, sBRCAm, and HRD in tumor specimens from newly diagnosed patients with ovarian cancer who underwent gBRCA testing. Of the 205 patients analyzed, 26.8% had a tBRCAm, including tBRCA1m (17.6%) and tBRCA2m (9.3%). The overall prevalence of tBRCAm, gBRCAm, sBRCAm, and HRD-positive status was 26.8%, 21.5%, 6.3%, and 60.0%, respectively. The calculated sBRCAm/tBRCAm ratio was 23.6% (13/55), and the prevalence of gBRCA variant of uncertain significance was 3.9%. These results suggest gBRCA testing alone cannot clearly identify the best course of treatment, highlighting the importance of sBRCA testing in Japan.

Most state-of-the-art RDHEI methods do not achieve desirable payload yet. To address this problem, we propose a new RDHEI method with hierarchical embedding. Our contributions are twofold. (1) A novel technique of hierarchical label map generation is proposed for the bit-planes of plaintext image. The hierarchical label map is calculated by using prediction technique, and it is compressed and embedded into the encrypted image. (2) Hierarchical embedding is designed to achieve a high embedding payload. This embedding technique hierarchically divides prediction errors into three kinds: small-magnitude, medium-magnitude, and large-magnitude, which are marked by different labels. Different from the conventional techniques, pixels with small-magnitude/large-magnitude prediction errors are both used to accommodate secret bits in the hierarchical embedding technique, and therefore contribute a high embedding payload. Experiments on two standard datasets are discussed to validate the proposed RDHEI method. The results demonstrate that the proposed RDHEI method outperforms some state-of-the-art RDHEI methods in payload. The average payloads of the proposed RDHEI method are 3.4568 bpp and 3.6823 bpp for BOWS-2 dataset and BOSSbase dataset, respectively.",Cryptography; Encryption; Payloads; Image coding; Data mining; Streaming media; Ciphers; Reversible data hiding; encrypted images; lossless compression; hierarchical embedding; high payload

These computers allowed the audience to interact with Erica through a range of sensors and actuators. In particular, the audience could feed and stroke her to prompt reactions, as well as send her Tweets to change her behaviour. Pi SBCs were chosen because of their ready availability and their educational pedigree. During the deployment, 'coding clubs' were run in the shopping centre where Erica was located, and these allowed children to experiment with and program the same components used in Erica.

For personalized treatment, an accurate pre-operative prognosis for GBM patients is highly desired. Recently, many machine learning-based methods have been adopted to predict overall survival (OS) time based on the pre-operative mono- or multi-modal imaging phenotype. The genotypic information of GBM has been proven to be strongly indicative of the prognosis; however, this has not been considered in the existing imaging-based OS prediction methods. The main reason is that the tumor genotype is unavailable pre-operatively unless deriving from craniotomy. In this paper, we propose a new deep learning-based OS prediction method for GBM patients, which can derive tumor genotype-related features from pre-operative multimodal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) brain data and feed them to OS prediction. Specifically, we propose a multi-task convolutional neural network (CNN) to accomplish both tumor genotype and OS prediction tasks jointly. As the network can benefit from learning tumor genotype-related features for genotype prediction, the accuracy of predicting OS time can be prominently improved. In the experiments, multimodal MRI brain dataset of 120 GBM patients, with as many as four different genotypic/molecular biomarkers, are used to evaluate our method. Our method achieves the highest OS prediction accuracy compared to other state-of-the-art methods.",Glioblastoma; overall survival; prognosis; genotype; molecular; multi-task; deep learning

This paper aims to contribute to the literature on segmenting cultural visitors by using the Bagged Clustering method, as an alternative and effective strategy to conduct cluster analysis when binary variables are used. The technique is a combination of hierarchical and partitioning methods and presents several advantages with respect to more standard techniques, such as k-means and LVQ. For this purpose, two ad hoc surveys were conducted between June and September 2011 in the two principal museums of the two provinces of the Trentino-South Tyrol region (Bolzano and Trento), Northern Italy: the South Tyrol Museum of Archaeology in Bolzano (OTZI), hosting the permanent exhibition of the ""Iceman"" Otzi, and the Museum of Modern and Contemporaneous Art of Trento and Rovereto (MART). The segmentation analysis was conducted separately for the two kinds of museums in order to find similarities and differences in behaviour patterns and characteristics of visitors. The analysis identified three and two cluster segments respectively for the MART and OTZI visitors, where two OTZI clusters presented similar characteristics to two out of three MART groups.

The main open issue for these approaches concerns the establishment of symmetric keys. A promising key distribution technique is the random predistribution of secret keys. Despite its effectiveness, this approach presents considerable memory overheads, in contrast with the limited resources of wireless sensor networks. In this paper, an in-depth analytical study is conducted on the state-of-the-art key distribution schemes based on random predistribution. A new protocol, called q-s-composite, is proposed in order to exploit the best features of random predistribution and to improve it with lower requirements. The main novelties of q-s-composite are represented by the organization of the secret material that allows a storing reduction, by the proposed technique for pairwise key generation, and by the limited number of predistributed keys used in the generation of a pairwise key.

In order to assure the safety of nuclear power plants, this paper proposes a systematic and integrated response time evaluation methodology that covers safety analyses, system designs, response time analyses, and response time tests. This methodology is applied to safety instrumentation systems for the advanced power reactor 1400 and the optimized power reactor 1000 nuclear power plants in South Korea.

Power Supply Rejection (PSR) is a performance metric that measures the LDO's ability to reject noise. Improving PSR has been the focus of many research groups. However, the state of the art does not recognize the best PSR enhancement schemes and collate them under comparable grounds. Further, the pass transistor's diode connection (through the Gate-Drain capacitance) impacts the PSR, and this effect is not quantified in the state of the art. This research aims to bridge these gaps first by explicating the constitution of a high PSR LDO. Then, the impact of the pass transistor's parasitics on PSR are quantified. Following this, the best state of the art PSR enhancement schemes are analyzed and simulated over a high-PSR core under similar conditions. This study reveals the strengths and limitations of each scheme, which unfolds each technique's applications. Results convey that the LDO Filter yields the best PSR improvement at low frequencies, Series feedback at mid frequencies, and RC filter at high frequencies. Assessment concludes that Series Feedback provides the best compromise with respect to PSR enhancement.",Logic gates; Transistors; Transconductors; Voltage; Regulators; Impedance; Bandwidth; Analog; LDO; linear regulators; power supply rejection (PSR); SPICE

Here, we show that cancer induces muscle wasting by selectively degrading myosin heavy chain (MHC) subtypes IIb and IIx through E3 ligase UBR2-mediated ubiquitylation. Induction of MHC loss and atrophy in C2C12 myotubes and mouse tibialis anterior (TA) by murine cancer cells required UBR2 up-regulation by cancer. Genetic gain or loss of UBR2 function inversely altered MHC level and muscle mass in TA of tumor-free mice. UBR2 selectively interacted with and ubiquitylated MHC-IIb and MHC-IIx through its substrate recognition and catalytic domain, respectively, in C2C12 myotubes. Elevation of UBR2 in muscle of tumor-bearing or free mice caused loss of MHC-IIb and MHC-IIx but not MHC-I and MHC-IIa or other myofibrillar proteins, including α-actin, troponin, tropomyosin, and tropomodulin. Muscle-specific knockout of UBR2 spared KPC tumor-bearing mice from losing MHC-IIb and MHC-IIx, fast-twitching muscle mass, cross-sectional area, and contractile force. The rectus abdominis (RA) muscle of patients with cachexia-prone cancers displayed a selective reduction of MHC-IIx in correlation with higher UBR2 levels. These data suggest that UBR2 is a regulator of MHC-IIb/IIx essential for cancer-induced muscle wasting, and that therapeutic interventions can be designed by blocking UBR2 up-regulation by cancer.",MHC-IIb; MHC-IIx; UBR2; cancer cachexia; ubiquitylation.

879,Darinaparsin (ZIO-101) enhances the sensitivity of small-cell lung cancer to PARP inhibitors,"Guo-Zhen Cao,Li-Ying Ma,Zong-Hui Zhang,Xiao-Lin Wang,Jing-Han Hua,Jia-Hui Zhang,Yang Lv,Shao-Bo Zhang,Jian Ou,Wen-Chu Lin,Guo-Zhen Cao,Li-Ying Ma,Zong-Hui Zhang,Xiao-Lin Wang,Jing-Han Hua,Jia-Hui Zhang,Yang Lv,Shao-Bo Zhang,Jian Ou,Wen-Chu Lin","Small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) is an aggressive high-grade neuroendocrine carcinoma of the lung associated with early metastasis and an exceptionally poor prognosis. Little progress has been made in developing efficacious targeted therapy for this recalcitrant disease. Herein, we showed that H3.3, encoded by two genes (H3F3A and H3F3B), was prominently overexpressed in SCLC. Darinaparsin (ZIO-101), a derivative of arsenic trioxide, dose- and time-dependently inhibited the viability of SCLC cells in an H3.3-dependent manner. More importantly, ZIO-101 treatment resulted in substantial accumulation of H3.3 and PARP1 besides induction of G2/M cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in SCLC cells. Through integrative analysis of the RNA-seq data from Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia dataset, JNCI and Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer 2 datasets, we found that H3F3A expression was negatively correlated with the IC50 values of PARP inhibitors (PARPi). Furthermore, co-targeting H3.3 and PARP1 by ZIO-101 and BMN673/olaparib achieved synergistic growth inhibition against SCLC in vitro and in vivo. In conclusion, it is feasible to target H3.3 by ZIO-101 to potentiate the response rate of PARPi in SCLC patients.",H3.3; PARP inhibitor; PARP1; combination treatment; darinaparsin; small-cell lung cancer.

Although well characterized in coastal environments, phenology remains poorly understood in the deep sea. Here we characterized intra-annual dynamics of feeding activity for the deep-sea octocoral Paragorgia arborea. Hourly changes in polyp activity were quantified using a time-lapse camera deployed for a year on Sur Ridge (1230 m depth; Northeast Pacific). The relationship between feeding and environmental variables, including surface primary production, temperature, acoustic backscatter, current speed and direction, was evaluated. Feeding activity was highly seasonal, with a dormancy period identified between January and early April, reflecting seasonal changes in food availability as suggested by primary production and acoustic backscatter data. Moreover, feeding varied with tides, which likely affected food delivery through cyclic oscillation in current speed and direction. This study provides the first evidence of behavioural rhythms in a coral species at depth greater than 1 km. Information on the feeding biology of this cosmopolitan deep-sea octocoral will contribute to a better understanding of how future environmental change may affect deep-sea coral communities and the ecosystem services they provide.",Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary; Paragorgia arborea; Sur Ridge; cold-water coral; polyp activity; temporal dynamics.

With the recent development in optical remote sensing, it is possible to identify oil wells from satellite images. Moreover, the recent advancement in deep learning frameworks for object detection in remote sensing makes it possible to automatically detect oil wells from remote sensing images. In this paper, we collected a dataset named Northeast Petroleum University-Oil Well Object Detection Version 1.0 (NEPU-OWOD V1.0) based on high-resolution remote sensing images from Google Earth Imagery. Our database includes 1192 oil wells in 432 images from Daqing City, which has the largest oilfield in China. In this study, we compared nine different state-of-the-art deep learning models based on algorithms for object detection from optical remote sensing images.

882,A fluorescent and colorimetric sensor based on ionic liquids for the on-site monitoring trace gaseous SO2,"Siying Che,Anni Xu,Qijia Shou,Linlin Yin,Chunsong Zhou,Haiyan Fu,Yuanbin She,Siying Che,Anni Xu,Qijia Shou,Linlin Yin,Chunsong Zhou,Haiyan Fu,Yuanbin She","SO2 could cause severe environmental pollution and health threat, so real-time and on-site monitoring of SO2 has attracted considerable attention. This work proposed a novel ionic liquid-based sensor, called trihexyl (tetradecyl) phosphonium fluorescein ionic liquid, which can accurately detect SO2 with its fluorescent and colorimetric dual-readout assay without seventeen gases interference (eg: NO, N2, CO2, O2, COS, HCl, CHCl3). GC-MS was also used to verify the validation of the detection method. First, this fluorescein-based IL sensor exhibited fluorescence green and colorimetric yellow signals. When the sensor was exposed to gaseous SO2, the green fluorescence quenched, and the colorimetric yellow color faded due to chemical bond interaction. Also, the proposed IL sensor exhibited good linearity in the SO2 concentration range of 5.0-95.0 ppm with a detection limit of 0.9 ppm (fluorescence) and 1.9 ppm (colorimetry), and recoveries of 97%∼103% with RSD less than 1.21%. Besides, the IL sensor could be easily assembled into a paper device by simple immersion, and the paper strip was exploited to realize a semiquantitative visual detection of SO2. These results indicated that the proposed fluorescence-colorimetric dual-signal chemosensor could be used as intelligent paper labels for real-time and on-site monitoring of SO2 in ambient air.",Fluorescent and colorimetric detection; Ionic liquid; Paper sensor; SO(2).
883,Image super-resolution via sparse representation over multiple learned dictionaries based on edge sharpness,"Yeganli, F.; Nazzal, M.; Unal, M.; Ozkaramanli, H.","A new algorithm for single-image super-resolution based on selective sparse representation over a set of coupled dictionary pairs is proposed. Patch sharpness measure for high- and low-resolution patch pairs defined via the magnitude of the gradient operator is shown to be approximately invariant to the patch resolution. This measure is employed in the training stage for clustering the training patch pairs and in the reconstruction stage for model selection. For each cluster, a pair of low- and high-resolution dictionaries is learned. In the reconstruction stage, the sharpness measure of a low-resolution patch is used to select the cluster it belongs to. The sparse coding coefficients of the patch over the selected low-resolution cluster dictionary are calculated. The underlying high-resolution patch is reconstructed by multiplying the high-resolution cluster dictionary with the calculated coefficients. The performance of the proposed algorithm is tested over a set of natural images. PSNR and SSIM results show that the proposed algorithm is competitive with the state-of-the-art super-resolution algorithms. In particular, it significantly out-performs the state-of-the-art algorithms for images with sharp edges and corners. Visual comparison results also support the quantitative results.",Single-image super-resolution; Sparse representation; Dictionary learning; Sharpness measure-based clustering; Multiple dictionary pairs
884,Management of Symptomatic Elastofibroma Dorsi: A Case Report and Literature Review,"Jamesa Fabien,Vijaykumar Patel,Megan Timpone,Jamesa Fabien,Vijaykumar Patel,Megan Timpone","Elastofibroma dorsi (ED) is a rare tumor that most often occurs in the subscapular and infrascapular region between the thoracic wall, serratus anterior, and latissimus dorsi muscle. Based on a review of the literature, ED has been deemed an extremely rare entity. However, the incidence may be greater and is difficult to determine as the majority of ED being asymptomatic and therefore undiagnosed. Surgical excision is commonly performed when patients present with pain associated with ED. This being the case, it is important to evaluate the factors contributing to the pain seen in these patients and to evaluate the risks vs benefits of intervening in symptomatic ED patients who present for possible surgical intervention. We herein report a case of bilateral ED, situated in the upper back with only the right side being symptomatic in a 56-year-old male laborer. Due to pain in the right upper back, the patient underwent surgical removal of the ED. The postoperative course was uneventful and the patient had an excellent recovery. A review of the literature showed no correlation between pain on presentation and tumor size or location. Major complications of treating these patients include seroma or hematoma formation which according to the literature can be avoided using postoperative tube drainage and compressing bandages.",. surgical excision; benign tumors; elastofibroma dorsi; fibroblastic tumor; subscapular region.
885,DeepQGHO: Quantized Greedy Hyperparameter Optimization in Deep Neural Networks for on-the-Fly Learning,"Chowdhury, Anjir Ahmed; Hossen, Md Abir; Azam, Md Ali; Rahman, Md Hafizur","On-the-fly learning is unavoidable for applications that demand instantaneous deep neural network (DNN) training or where transferring data to the central system for training is costly. Hyperparameter optimization plays a significant role in the performance and reliability in deep learning. Many hyperparameter optimization algorithms have been developed for obtaining better validation accuracy in DNNs. Most state-of-the-art hyperparameter optimization techniques are computationally expensive due to the focus on validation accuracy. Therefore, they are unsuitable for on-the-fly learning applications that require faster computation on resource constraint devices (e.g., edge devices). In this paper, we develop a novel greedy approach-based hyperparameter optimization (GHO) algorithm enabling faster computing on edge devices for on-the-fly learning applications. In GHO, we obtain the validation accuracy locally for each of the hyperparameter configurations. The GHO algorithm optimizes each hyperparameter while keeping the others constant in order to converge to the locally optimal solution in the expectation that this choice will lead to a globally optimal solution. We perform an empirical study to compute the performance such as computation time and energy consumption of the GHO and compare it with two state-of-the-art hyperparameter optimization algorithms. We also deploy the GHO algorithm in an edge device to validate the performance of our algorithm. We perform post-training quantization on the GHO algorithm to reduce the inference time. Our GHO algorithm is more than 3x energy efficient and 2x faster than two state-of-the-art hyperparameter optimization techniques on both DNNs and datasets studied in this paper.",Greedy algorithm; deep learning; neural networks; online learning; hyperparameter optimization; TinyML; quantization

We study a chromatic variant of the problem, where each guard is assigned one of k distinct colors. The chromatic art gallery problem is to find a guard set for P such that no two guards with the same color have overlapping visibility regions. We study the decision version of this problem for orthogonal polygons with r-visibility when the number of colors is k = 2. Here, two points are r-visible if the smallest axis-aligned rectangle containing them lies entirely within the polygon. In this paper, it is shown that determining whether there is an r-visibility guard set for an orthogonal polygon with holes such that no two guards with the same color have overlapping visibility regions is NP-hard when the number of colors is k = 2.",chromatic art gallery problem; orthogonal polygons; rvisibility; NP-hard

The technique decomposes the input image into the four frequency subbands by using DWT and estimates the singular value matrix of the low-low subband image, and, then, it reconstructs the enhanced image by applying inverse DWT. The technique is compared with conventional image equalization techniques such as standard general histogram equalization and local histogram equalization, as well as state-of-the-art techniques such as brightness preserving dynamic histogram equalization and singular value equalization. The experimental results show the superiority of the proposed method over conventional and state-of-the-art techniques.",Discrete wavelet transform; image equalization; satellite image contrast enhancement

To this end, in this paper, we propose a Traffic aware and Link Quality sensitive Routing Protocol (TLRP) for urban Internet of Vehicles (IoV). First, we design a novel routing metric, i.e., Link Transmission Quality (LTQ), to account for the impact of the number, quality and relative positions of communication links along a routing path on the network performance. Then, to adapt to the dynamic characteristics of IoV, a road weight evaluation scheme is presented to assess each road segment using the real-time traffic and link information quantified by the LTQ. Next, the path with the lowest aggregated weight is selected as the routing candidate. Extensive simulations demonstrate that our proposed protocol achieves significant performance improvements compared to the state-of-the-art protocol MM-GPSR, the typical junction-based scheme E-GyTAR, and the classic connectivity-based routing iCAR, in terms of packet delivery ratio and average transmission delay.",Routing; Routing protocols; Roads; Delays; Trajectory; Internet of Vehicles; geographic routing protocol; routing metric; link transmission quality

Despite their achievements, however, there remains a demand for an advanced method that can offer detailed insights into cellular functions with higher spatiotemporal resolution. Here, we present a pH image sensor that employs a high-density array of 256 x 256 pixels and readout circuitry designed for fast operation. The sensor's characteristics, such as the pH sensitivity of 55.1 mV/pH and higher frame speed of 1933 fps, are experimentally demonstrated and compared to those of state-of-the-art pH image sensors. Among them, our sensor presents the smallest pitch of 2 mu m with a significantly high operation speed. This sensor can successfully detect a pH change, but also transform the measured data to a two-dimensional image series in real time. The practical spatial resolution of images is investigated by an evaluation method that we first propose in this paper. By this method, we confirm that our sensor can discriminate objects distanced over 4 mu m apart, which is twice bigger than the pixel pitch. In order to analyze the degraded resolution and image blur, a capacitive coupling effect at an ion-sensitive membrane is suggested as the main factor and demonstrated by simulation.",High-density array; high frame rate; ion sensitive field effect transistor (ISFET); pH image sensor; pH monitoring; spatial resolution

One solution to solve some of these problems is to use multibiometrics where different biometric systems are combined together (multiple captures of the same biometric modality, multiple feature extraction algorithms, multiple biometric modalities ... ). In this paper, we are interested in score level fusion functions application (i.e., we use a multibiometric authentication scheme which accept or deny the claimant for using an application). In the state of the art, the weighted sum of scores (which is a linear classifier) and the use of an SVM (which is a non linear classifier) provided by different biometric systems provide one of the best performances. We present a new method based on the use of genetic programming giving similar or better performances (depending on the complexity of the database). We derive a score fusion function by assembling some classical primitives functions (+, *, -, ... ).

In this article, instead of reviewing the theoretical studies on RL, which were almost fully completed several decades ago, we summarize some state-of-the-art techniques added to commonly used RL frameworks for robot control. We mainly review bioinspired robots (BIRs) because they can learn to locomote or produce natural behaviors similar to animals and humans. With the ultimate goal of practical applications in real world, we further narrow our review scope to techniques that could aid in sim-to-real transfer. We categorized these techniques into four groups: 1) use of accurate simulators; 2) use of kinematic and dynamic models; 3) use of hierarchical and distributed controllers; and 4) use of demonstrations. The purposes of these four groups of techniques are to supply general and accurate environments for RL training, improve sampling efficiency, divide and conquer complex motion tasks and redundant robot structures, and acquire natural skills. We found that, by synthetically using these techniques, it is possible to deploy RL on physical BIRs in actuality.",Robots; Engines; Training; Task analysis; Legged locomotion; Reinforcement learning; Kinematics; Bioinspired robots; reinforcement learning (RL); sim-to-real; transfer techniques

The efficacy and safety of omalizumab treatment in allergic asthma clinical trials and its effectiveness in the real world have been reported in numerous studies. In this review, we examine clinical evidence in pediatric and adult patients with allergic asthma who received omalizumab treatment for at least 2 years, to assess its effectiveness, durability, and trajectory of response over time as well as safety. We performed a literature search from inception until March 2022 in PubMed using the keywords ""omalizumab"" and ""allergic asthma"" to retrieve articles examining the effects of omalizumab in patients with allergic asthma, aged ≥6 years. Only articles that evaluated the effectiveness of omalizumab for at least 2 years were included. Data from case reports were excluded. Our review confirmed the long-term effectiveness and safety of omalizumab, demonstrating reduced rate of exacerbations, improved lung function, asthma control, and quality of life, decreased health care resource utilization, and use of corticosteroids (oral/inhaled) with a favorable safety and tolerability profile for up to 9 years in adult patients with moderate-to-severe allergic asthma.

To overcome limitations of state-of-the-art optical tracking systems, a pipeline for robust target identification and 3D point reconstruction has been investigated that enables camera calibration and tracking in environments with poor illumination, static and moving ambient light sources, occlusions and harsh conditions, such as fog. For evaluation, the system has been successfully applied in three different wide and unconstrained indoor environments, (1) user tracking for virtual and augmented reality applications, (2) handheld target tracking for tunneling and (3) machine guidance for mining. The results of each use case are discussed to embed the presented approach into a larger technological and application context. The experimental results demonstrate the system's capabilities to track targets up to 100 m. Comparing the proposed approach to prior art in optical tracking in terms of range coverage and accuracy, it significantly extends the available tracking range, while only requiring two cameras and providing a relative 3D point accuracy with sub-centimeter deviation up to 30 m and low-centimeter deviation up to 100 m.",indoor positioning; optical; wide-area; virtual teality; surveying

Image-guided percutaneous biopsy allows for real-time visualization of the biopsy needle and surrounding structures, combining high diagnostic accuracy with safety and cost-effectiveness. However, determining a surgically optimal biopsy trajectory for a mass can be technically challenging due to critical surrounding anatomy or challenging needle approach angles. Inappropriately placed biopsies can have serious repercussions on patient function and oncological survival. The potential for needle tract seeding and local recurrence after biopsy of sarcoma has been central to the debate regarding the need for excision of the biopsy tract.

896,"A Benchmark for Studying Diabetic Retinopathy: Segmentation, Grading, and Transferability","Zhou, Yi; Wang, Boyang; Huang, Lei; Cui, Shanshan; Shao, Ling","People with diabetes are at risk of developing an eye disease called diabetic retinopathy (DR). This disease occurs when high blood glucose levels cause damage to blood vessels in the retina. Computer-aided DR diagnosis has become a promising tool for the early detection and severity grading of DR, due to the great success of deep learning. However, most current DR diagnosis systems do not achieve satisfactory performance or interpretability for ophthalmologists, due to the lack of training data with consistent and fine-grained annotations. To address this problem, we construct a large fine-grained annotated DR dataset containing 2,842 images (FGADR). Specifically, this dataset has 1,842 images with pixel-level DR-related lesion annotations, and 1,000 images with image-level labels graded by six board-certified ophthalmologists with intra-rater consistency. The proposed dataset will enable extensive studies on DR diagnosis. Further, we establish three benchmark tasks for evaluation: 1. DR lesion segmentation; 2. DR grading by joint classification and segmentation; 3. Transfer learning for ocular multi-disease identification. Moreover, a novel inductive transfer learning method is introduced for the third task. Extensive experiments using different state-of-the-art methods are conducted on our FGADR dataset, which can serve as baselines for future research.

To reduce surgeons' contact with radioactive tissue and remain within occupational dose limits, current guidelines recommend delaying transplants at least 14 days, if possible. We wanted to determine the level of radiation exposure to the transplant surgeon when explanting an irradiated liver before the recommended decay period. An ex-vivo radiation exposure analysis was conducted on the explanted liver of a patient who received Y-90 therapy 46 h prior to orthotopic liver transplant. To estimate exposure to the surgeon's hands, radiation dosimeter rings were placed inside three different surgical glove configurations and exposed to the explanted liver. Estimated radiation doses corrected for Y-90 decay were calculated. Radiation safety gloves performed best, with an average radiation exposure rate of 5.36 mSV h(-1) in the static hand position, an 83% reduction in exposure over controls with no glove (31.31 mSv h(-1)). Interestingly, non-radiation safety gloves also demonstrated reduced exposure rates, well below occupational regulation limits. Handling of Y-90 radiated organs within the immediate post-treatment period can be done safely and does not exceed federal occupational dose limits if appropriate gloves and necessary precautions are exercised.",radiation; exposures; Y-90; liver; safety; surgeons
898,Collaborative Filtering With Ranking-Based Priors on Unknown Ratings,"Chen, Jin; Lian, Defu; Zheng, Kai","Advanced collaborative filtering methods based on explicit feedback assume that unknown ratings are missing not at random. The state-of-the-art algorithm hypothesizes that unknown items are weakly rated and sets an explicit prior to unknown ratings. However, the prior assuming unknown ratings be close to zero may be questionable and it is challenging to set appropriate prior ratings for unknown items. In this article, to avert the use of prior ratings, we propose a ranking-based prior by hypothesizing that each user's unknown ratings are close to each other. This prior essentially acts as a regularizer to penalize the discrepancy of predicted ratings between any two unknown items. With the ranking-based prior, we design a generic collaborative filtering framework for explicit feedback and develop an efficient optimization algorithm for parameter learning. We finally evaluate the proposed algorithms on four real-world rating datasets. The results show that the proposed algorithms consistently outperform the state-of-the-art baselines and that the ranking-based prior leads to superior recommendation accuracy.",Collaboration; Prediction algorithms; Intelligent systems; Optimization; Predictive models; Matrix decomposition; Estimation; Recommendations; Data Mining; Information Retrieval; Collaborative Filtering
899,Unsupervised Two-Path Neural Network for Cell Event Detection and Classification Using Spatiotemporal Patterns,"Ha Tran Hong Phan; Kumar, Ashnil; Feng, David; Fulham, Michael; Kim, Jinman","Automatic event detection in cell videos is essential for monitoring cell populations in biomedicine. Deep learning methods have advantages over traditional approaches for cell event detection due to their ability to capture more discriminative features of cellular processes. Supervised deep learning methods, however, are inherently limited due to the scarcity of annotated data. Unsupervised deep learning methods have shown promise in general (non-cell) videos because they can learn the visual appearance and motion of regularly occurring events. Cell videos, however, can have rapid, irregular changes in cell appearance and motion, such as during cell division and death, which are often the events of most interest. We propose a novel unsupervised two-path input neural network architecture to capture these irregular events with three key elements: 1) a visual encoding path to capture regular spatiotemporal patterns of observed objects with convolutional long short-term memory units; 2) an event detection path to extract information related to irregular events with max-pooling layers; and 3) integration of the hidden states of the two paths to provide a comprehensive representation of the video that is used to simultaneously locate and classify cell events. We evaluated our network in detecting cell division in densely packed stem cells in phase-contrast microscopy videos.

In October 2021, a leaf spot disease was observed on I. nil in a field as weed in Jingzhou (N 30° 21', E 112° 19'), Hubei Province, China. Symptoms began as small brown blotches, then developed into oval or irregularly shaped brown necrotic lesions. In severe cases, the leaves were completely necrotic and detached. In the surveyed area, the incidence was between 30% - 40%. To isolate the pathogen, twenty-one leaf pieces (5×5 mm) were cut from the lesion edges of seven symptomatic leaves, disinfected with 70% ethanol and 2% sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl), rinsed with sterile water five times, then placed on three potato dextrose agar (PDA) modified with 50 μg/mL kanamycin, and incubated at 25 °C in dark for 5 days. The isolates were subcultured by transferring mycelium tips. Sixteen fungal strains were isolated from the tissues, and nine of them showed similar morphological characteristics. After cultured 7 days on PDA at 25 °C, the nine colonies were initially white, then turned greenish brown to black in the center and had abundant fine villous aerial mycelia up to 61.5 mm in average diameter. To examine its conidial morphology, the fungi were cultured for 7 days on potato carrot agar (PCA) at 22°C with a light/dark period of 8/16 h. On PCA, conidia were brown or olive-brown, obclavate to obpyriform, with a short beak, one to five transverse and zero to three longitudinal septa. They formed chains of 1 - 8 conidia, with branches. Conidia were 16 - 46 µm long and 8 - 14 µm wide (n=50). These morphological features were similar to those described in Alternaria spp. (Simmons 2007). A single isolate ""Q2"" was selected for molecular identification because it was the most aggressive in preliminary leaf pathogenicity assays. The internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of rDNA and histone 3 (H3) gene were amplified and sequenced using primers ITS1/ITS4 (White et al. 1990) and H3-1a/H3-1b (Zheng et al. 2015). BLAST analysis revealed that the sequences (ITS, ON360984; H3, ON375577) were 100% identical to Alternaria alternata (ITS, MK396607; H3, MN840996), respectively. Maximum likelihood analysis based on combined two gene sequences was conducted with an evolutionary model of GTR+I+G under 1000 bootstrap replicates. Phylogenetic tree showed that Q2 and Alternaria alternata 21-5 and BLH-YB-11 located in one clade supported with 99% bootstrap values. The pathogen was identified as A. alternata. To fulfill Koch's postulate, 10 ml conidia (106 spores/ml) of Q2 was sprayed on five healthy seedlings, with sterile distilled water as a control. All leaves were rinsed three times with sterile water before inoculation. All seedlings were placed in sealed plastic bags with air valves, and grown in a greenhouse (25 ± 2 ˚C, RH 65%). The test was repeated twice. After 10 days, symptoms typical of brown blotches similar to those observed in the field were observed on leaves of inoculated plants, while control remained healthy. A. alternata was re-isolated from the inoculated symptomatic leaves with a frequency of 100% based on morphological and molecular characters, thus Koch's postulate was confirmed.

901,Omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2: a review of existing literature,"Lovedeep Kaur,Ashok Kumar Ahirwar,Lovedeep Kaur,Ashok Kumar Ahirwar","On November 24th, 2021 a case of a new viral variant of SARS-CoV-2 was reported by South Africa and Botswana to WHO, which later was designated as the variant of concern on 26th November 2021. It has around 60 mutations (50 non synonymous, 8 synonymous, and 2 non coding) as compared to the original parent strain of Wuhan. Different hypotheses have been put forward as an explanation for the origin like reverse zoonosis i.e. animal to human transmission, origin from an immune compromised patient or use of highly mutagenic drug like molnupiravir as treatment. A huge spike in cases around the globe is suggestive of a high rate of infectivity and transmissivity as compared to the previous known variants. With whatever cases have been documented so far, it is said that omicron causes mostly mild clinical illnesses and there is a less chance of hospitalization according to the clinicians. Among the reported cases, there were already vaccinated patients also. So there is a possibility that omicron might be able to evade the vaccine induced immunity due to a huge number of mutations (especially in the spike protein sequences). Until new vaccines specific to the pathogen are being developed, the coverage of the currently acceptable vaccines should be increased so that none is deprived of the mandatory doses and a third booster dose might help to reduce the chances of serious complications of this new strain beforehand. So an equal focus on the host and environment is required along with the pathogen.",COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2; omicron; pandemic.

So, the best natural approach to lowering the carbon from the atmosphere is mangroves which have more potential to sequestrate carbon. But mangroves are under threat due to land use land cover change. This research has been carried out on the mangroves of Gulf of Khambhat, Gujarat, India, where anthropic activity is affecting the mangrove forest cover with spatiotemporal heterogeneity. In the present study, multi-temporal high-resolution satellite data AVNIR-2 (Advanced Visible and Near Infrared Radiometer type-2) and LISS-4 (Linear Imaging Self-Scanning Sensors-4) were used for the demarcation of various land use/land cover class (LULC), and change analysis and assessment of mangroves health for the years 2009, 2014, and 2019. The impact of saltpan/aquaculture on mangroves growth and its health status has been calculated by various MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) satellite data products such as gross primary productivity (GPP), enhanced vegetation index (EVI), and leaf area index (LAI) in Google Earth Engine (GEE), and field-based method was also considered. This study suggests that there is a marginal increase (17.11 km2) in mangrove cover during the assessment period 2009-2019; on other side, 65.42 km2 was degraded also. However, increase in saltpan/aquaculture is imposing an adverse effect on mangroves' basal area, plant density, and productivity. Change analysis also suggests a reduction in healthy mangrove area (from 25.20 to 2.84 km2), which will have an impact on ecosystem services.",Land use land cover dynamics; MODIS; Multi-temporal satellite data; Vegetation indices.
903,Deep and shallow fast embedded capsule networks: going faster with capsules,"Abo-Zahhad, Mohammed; Eldifrawi, Islam; Abdelwahab, Moataz; Abd El-Malek, Ahmed H.","Capsule Networks (CapsNets) is a great approach for understanding data in the field of computer vision. CapsNets allow a deeper understanding of images compared to the traditional Convolutional Neural Networks. The first test for CapsNet was in digits recognition on the 'MNIST' dataset, where it successfully achieved high accuracy. CapsNets are reliable at deciphering overlapping digits. Deep Capsule Networks achieved state-of-the-art accuracy in CIFAR10 which isn't achieved by shallow capsule networks. Despite all these accomplishments, Deep Capsule Networks are very slow due to the 'Dynamic Routing' algorithm. In this paper, Fast Embedded Capsule Network and Deep Fast Embedded Capsule Network are introduced, representing novel capsule network architectures that uses 1D convolution based dynamic routing with a fast element-wise multiplication transformation process. These architectures not only compete with the state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy in the capsule domain, but also excels in terms of speed, and reduced complexity. This is shown by the 58% reduction in the number of trainable parameters and 64% reduction in the average epoch time in the training process.

904,Communal visual histories to detect environmental change in northern areas: Examples of emerging North American and Eurasian practices,"Mustonen, Tero","This article explores the pioneering potential of communal visual-optic histories which are recorded, painted, documented, or otherwise expressed. These materials provide collective meanings of an image or visual material within a specific cultural group. They potentially provide a new method for monitoring and documenting changes to ecosystem health and species distribution, which can effectively inform society and decision makers of Arctic change. These visual histories can be positioned in a continuum that extends from rock art to digital photography. They find their expressions in forms ranging from images to the oral recording of knowledge and operate on a given cultural context. For monitoring efforts in the changing boreal zone and Arctic, a respectful engagement with visual histories can reveal emerging aspects of change. The examples from North America and case studies from Eurasia in this article include Inuit sea ice observations, Yu'pik visual traditions of masks, fish die-offs in a sub-boreal catchment area, permafrost melt in the Siberian tundra and early, first detection of a scarabaeid beetle outbreak, a Southern species in the Skolt Sami area.

Although polyglutamine expansion accelerates protein aggregation, the misfolding process is frequently instigated by flanking domains. For example, polyglutamine expansion in ataxin-3 allosterically triggers the aggregation of the catalytic Josephin domain. The molecular mechanism that underpins this allosteric aggregation trigger remains to be determined. Here, we establish that polyglutamine expansion increases the molecular mobility of two juxtaposed helices critical to ataxin-3 deubiquitinase activity. Within one of these helices, we identified a highly amyloidogenic sequence motif that instigates aggregation and forms the core of the growing fibril. Critically, by mutating residues within this key region, we decrease local structural fluctuations to slow ataxin-3 aggregation. This provides significant insight, down to the molecular level, into how polyglutamine expansion drives aggregation and explains the positive correlation between polyglutamine tract length, protein aggregation, and disease severity.",Huntington disease; Machado-Joseph disease; amyloid; ataxia; ataxin-3; molecular dynamics; polyglutamine; protein misfolding; spinocerebellar ataxia type-3.

With the rapid development of a convolutional neural network in image processing, deep learning has been used for medical image segmentation, such as optic disc segmentation, blood vessel detection, lung segmentation, cell segmentation, and so on. Previously, U-net based approaches have been proposed. However, the consecutive pooling and strided convolutional operations led to the loss of some spatial information. In this paper, we propose a context encoder network (CE-Net) to capture more high-level information and preserve spatial information for 2D medical image segmentation. CE-Net mainly contains three major components: a feature encoder module, a context extractor, and a feature decoder module. We use the pretrained ResNet block as the fixed feature extractor. The context extractor module is formed by a newly proposed dense atrous convolution block and a residual multi-kernel pooling block. We applied the proposed CE-Net to different 2D medical image segmentation tasks. Comprehensive results show that the proposed method outperforms the original U-Net method and other state-of-the-art methods for optic disc segmentation, vessel detection, lung segmentation, cell contour segmentation, and retinal optical coherence tomography layer segmentation.",Image segmentation; Feature extraction; Convolution; Biomedical optical imaging; Optical imaging; Computed tomography; Medical image segmentation; deep learning; context encoder network

However, automatic vascular detection continues to be an open issue because of difficulties posed by multiple factors, such as poor contrast, in homogeneous backgrounds, anatomical variations, and the presence of noise during image acquisition. In this paper, we propose a novel 2-D/3-D symmetry filter to tackle these challenging issues for enhancing vessels from different imaging modalities. The proposed filter not only considers local phase features by using a quadrature filter to distinguish between lines and edges, but also uses the weighted geometric mean of the blurred and shifted responses of the quadrature filter, which allows more tolerance of vessels with irregular appearance. As a result, this filter shows a strong response to the vascular features under typical imaging conditions. Results based on eight publicly available datasets (six 2-D data sets, one 3-D data set, and one 3-D synthetic data set) demonstrate its superior performance to other state-of-the-art methods.",Symmetry filter; local phase; vascular; enhancement; angiography

The purpose of ICT is to restrict intact cells to a specific location while allowing biological function. It improves cell stability, operational flexibility, and control in brewing, as well as ease in executing continuous operations. We investigated the use of yeast biocapsules for Indian Pale Ale (IPA) type beer wort fermentation, a novel ICT in brewing. Yeast biocapsules are a spherical yeast immobilization system in which yeast cells are encapsulated and connected to the hyphae of an inactivated hollow filamentous fungus pellet. Fermentations with yeast encapsulated in alginate beads, as the standard immobilization practice, and in free (non-immobilized) forms were carried out in parallel. We found that yeast biocapsules are a better option for cell reutilization than alginate beads, but worse for beer must clarity. Beer brewed with yeast biocapsules differed in concentration for five volatile compounds (acetaldehyde, diacetyl, ethyl acetate, 1,1-diethoxyethane, and isoamyl alcohol) and three sensory characters (persistency of the foam, malt, and yeast character).

910,LIGHT DESIGN IN RUSSIAN UNIVERSITIES: WHAT AND HOW TO TEACH?,"Zaeva-Burdonskaya, Elena A.; Nazarov, Yuri, V","Light design as a prominent and self-sufficient branch of design has appeared and developed abroad and is a rather new part of Russian design practice. Along with solving practical problems, it is time to think on the aspects of training of light design specialists in Russian design universities. Engineering and technical, and partially artistic aspects in light design education, have international nature to a great extent, but the new specialty has been acquiring its own distinctions in Russia, which are mainly related to aesthetical problems of the profession and specific understanding of the cultural and historical context. These national distinctions have first appeared in practice and theoretical studies and then they began being translated into the educational sphere, turning into authorial education programmes and techniques and predetermining selection of design problems and their implementation methods. Light design implies training of interdisciplinary specialists, which requires a comprehensive approach to development of the educational process including innovative-technological as well as humanitarian sections, forming an unconventional model of the educational process. The Environment Design sub-department of Moscow State Stroganov Academy of Design and Applied Arts, the oldest Russian art and industry school, has gained a rich experience in artistic design in the field of light design, which comprises all leading professional trends.

Previous studies have not performed a broad analysis of the allergenic peptide content and protease activity of milk feeds in this population. Methods: To evaluate feasibility, we initially performed mass spectrometry on 4 human milk (HM) samples (2 term and 2 preterm) from the Mommy's Milk Human Milk Biorepository (HMB) and analyzed the results against the University of Nebraska FASTA database and UniProt for a total of 2,211 protein sequences. We then further analyzed five samples from the Microbiome, Atopy, and Prematurity (MAP) study including peptidomic and protease activity analysis. Results: Each HMB sample had between 806 and 1,007 proteins, with 37-44 nonhuman proteins/sample encompassing 26 plant and animal species. In the preterm MAP samples, 784 digested nonhuman proteins were identified, 30 were nonbovine in origin. Proteins from 23 different species including aeroallergens, food, and contact allergens were identified. Protease activity was highest in HM samples without human milk fortifier and lowest in preterm formula. Conclusions: These findings represent the first preterm milk feed mass spectrometry and protease analysis with identification of known allergenic proteins to food, contact, and aeroallergens. These results raise questions of whether the composition of milk feeds in the neonatal intensive care unit impact the development of atopic disease in the preterm population and whether the complex interaction between allergens, proteases, and other HM components can serve to induce sensitization or tolerance to allergens in infants.

The method is built on hybrid density functional theory where the inclusion of a fraction of exact exchange is critical. Two examples of where the methodology has been applied are described. The first example is the mechanism for water oxidation in photosystem II, and the second one is the mechanism for N2 activation by nitrogenase. The mechanism for PSII has obtained very strong support from subsequent experiments.

Over 150 rock shelters in the remote Kimberley region of Western Australia were visited in five field seasons. Mud wasp nest samples were collected from 108 sites. Thirty newly constructed wasp nests were collected to understand their initial composition and to determine the major sources of carbon. Charcoal-rich fractions extracted from 9 modem nests were radiocarbon dated and, whilst most were of zero age, some were found to be up to 1000 years old with the mean age being 255 years. Of the old wasp nest samples, 120 were utilised in the experiments reported here. A variety of different physical and chemical pretreatment methods were explored but small sample sizes and low carbon concentrations limit the range of techniques that can be used in practice. The radiocarbon ages measured on the 75 nest samples that contained sufficient carbon for analysis ranged from Modern to just over 20 cal ka BP. Half of these nests were older than 8 cal ka BP and 20% were older than 11 cal ka BP. Even allowing for the inherent uncertainties due to any inbuilt carbon age, the method is capable of producing useful age estimates for rock art and other features of archaeological interest, in relatively open rock shelters.",Radiocarbon dating; Rock art; Mud wasp nests; Charcoal; Pretreatment protocols; Kimberley western Australia; Quaternary; Geochronology

These methods out-perform several state-of-the-art methods. However, in RNNRec and GRURec, action vectors and item vectors are shared among users. The different meanings of the same action for different users are not considered. Similarly, different user preference for the same item is also ignored. To address this problem, the models of RNNRec and GRURec are modified in this paper. In the proposed methods, action vectors and item vectors are transformed into the user space for each user firstly, and then the transformed vectors are fed into the original neural networks of RNNRec and GRURec. The transformed action vectors and item vectors represent the user specified meaning of actions and the preference for items, which makes the proposed method obtain more accurate recommendation results. The experimental results on two real-life datasets indicate that the proposed method outperforms RNNRec and GRURec as well as other state-of-the-art approaches in most cases.",recommender system; collaborative filtering; time heterogeneous feedback; recurrent neural network; gated recurrent unit (GRU); user space transformation

The stiffness of the scaffold extracellular matrix determines the cell's fate via cell adhesion migration and differentiation in-vitro and in-vivo. This study aims to investigate the effect of hydrothermal treatment on polyelectrolyte complex (PEC) fibrous biomaterials and its effect on scaffold morphology, cell viability, and function in-vitro. FTIR analysis revealed the ability of the thermal treatment to set the interaction of HAp with polymeric PEC fibers. FESEM analysis showed that with an increase in temperature, the interconnectivity and pore size increased (control-82.38 ± 12.92 μm; at 120°C-335.48 ± 85.10 μm). Mechanical tests showed that the scaffolds heated at 90°C showed the highest stiffness in both dry and wet states (dry state: 1.82 ± 0.07 MPa, wet state: 122 ± 1.78 kPa). Additionally, the hydrothermal treatment also improved the aqueous stability as well as swelling capacity. According to the experimental findings, hydrothermal treatment is a useful technique for crosslinker-free gelation with improved mechanical strength and nanofibrous structure. Furthermore, the cell adhesion, proliferation, and osteogenic differentiation of the MG63 cells on the hydrogel scaffolds in-vitro were evaluated by MTT assay, confocal imaging, alkaline phosphatase assay, and collagen estimation. The in-vitro study showed that scaffolds fabricated at 90°C promoted better MG63 cell attachment, proliferation, and differentiation.

Identifying camera is possible by analyzing camera's sensor artifacts that occur during the process of photo processing. The problem of digital camera identification has been popular for a long time. Recently many effective and robust algorithms for solving this problem have been proposed. However, almost all solutions are based on state-of-the-art algorithm, proposed by Lukas et al. in 2006. Core of this algorithm is to calculate the so-called sensor pattern noise based on denoising images with wavelet-based denoising filter. Such technique is very efficient, but very time consuming. In this paper we consider tracing cameras by analyzing defects of their optical systems, like vignetting and lens distortion. We show that analysis of vignetting defect allows for recognizing brand of the camera. Lens distortion can be used to distinguish images from different cameras. Experimental evaluation was carried out on 60 devices (compact cameras and smartphones) for a total number of 12 051 images, with support of the Dresden Image Database. Proposed methods do not require denoising images with wavelet-based denoising filter what has a significant influence for speed of image processing, compared with state-of-the-art algorithm.",Hardwaremetry; Camera recognition; Sensor identification; Photo response non uniformity; Distortion; Vignetting; Privacy; Digital forensics

It has been identified that the filters in the state-of-the-art spectral graph convolutional networks (SGCNs) are essentially low-pass filters that enforce smoothness across the graph and use the functions of graph Laplacian as a tool that injects graph structure into the learning algorithm. There had been research findings that connect the smoothness functional in graphs, graph Laplacian, and regularization operators.

Hence, capturing, storing, and reusing design information, design intent, and underlining design knowledge to support design activities is a key issue in engineering knowledge management. To meet the demand for engineering designers regarding functional feature and engineering specification-based knowledge resources, this study proposes a novel scheme for functional feature and engineering specification-based reference design retrieval using an integrated clustering approach for providing engineering designers with easy access to relevant reference design and associated knowledge. The research objectives can be achieved by performing the following five tasks: (i) designing a functional feature and engineering specification-based reference design retrieval process, (ii) developing a functional feature and engineering specification representation, (iii) investigating and integrating ART1 (adaptive resonance theory 1) neural network, GA (genetic algorithm), and fuzzy ART (fuzzy adaptive resonance theory) clustering techniques, and (iv) implementing a functional feature and engineering specification-based reference design retrieval mechanism and experimenting with an example. The retrieval process involves three steps: functional feature and engineering specification-based query, similar design case search and retrieval, and similar design case ranking. The techniques involved include: (i) a binary code-based representation for functional feature and an EXPRESS language-based representation for engineering specification, (ii) ART1 neural network and genetic algorithm for functional feature-based similar design case clustering, (iii) fuzzy ART for engineering specification-based similar design ease clustering, (iv) similarity calculation for ranking similar design cases, and (v) a case-based representation for designed entities.",engineering knowledge management; reference design retrieval; adaptive resonance theory (ART); genetic algorithm (GA); fuzzy adaptive resonance theory (fuzzy ART)

Results: ORADUR-methylphenidate significantly decreased inattention (Cohen d = 2.17) and hyperactivity-impulsivity (Cohen d = 0.98) symptoms. We found less activation in the right inferior frontal gyrus (rIFG) in the pre-treatment ADHD children than TD children and greater treatment-induced activation in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) and the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (rDLPFC). There was no significant difference between the post-treatment ADHD and TD groups. However, the treatment-related activations in the dACC, rDLPFC, and rIFG were significantly correlated with CCPT and RVP measures. Conclusions: Our findings indicated that ORADUR-methylphenidate increased brain activations in the dACC, rDLPFC, and rIFG in children with ADHD, associated with improved focused attention, reduced impulsivity, and enhanced inhibition control. Activities of these brain regions might be biomarkers for the treatment effectiveness of methylphenidate for ADHD.

This paradigm, which builds upon three main components, is particularly compute-intensive and represents many image processing pipelines' bottlenecks. State-of-the-art solutions leverage hardware acceleration to speed up image registration, but they are usually limited to implementing a single component. We present Faber, an open-source HW/SW CAD toolchain tailored to image registration. The Faber toolchain comprises HW/SW highly-tunable registration components, supports users with different expertise in building custom pipelines, and automates the design process. In this direction, Faber provides both default settings for entry-level users and latency and resource models to guide HW experts in customizing the different components.

W.; Wang, Defeng; Shi, Lin","Acute ischemic stroke is recognized as a common cerebral vascular disease in aging people. Accurate diagnosis and timely treatment can effectively improve the blood supply of the ischemic area and reduce the risk of disability or even death. Understanding the location and size of infarcts plays a critical role in the diagnosis decision. However, manual localization and quantification of stroke lesions are laborious and time-consuming. In this paper, we propose a novel automatic method to segment acute ischemic stroke from diffusion weighted images (DWIs) using deep 3-D convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Our method can efficiently utilize 3-D contextual information and automatically learn very discriminative features in an end-to-end and data-driven way. To relieve the difficulty of training very deep 3-D CNN, we equip our network with dense connectivity to enable the unimpeded propagation of information and gradients throughout the network. We train our model with Dice objective function to combat the severe class imbalance problem in data. A DWI data set containing 242 subjects (90 for training, 62 for validation, and 90 for testing) with various types of acute ischemic stroke was constructed to evaluate our method. Our model achieved high performance on various metrics (Dice similarity coefficient: 79.13%, lesionwise precision: 92.67%, and lesionwise F1 score: 89.25%), outperforming the other state-of- the-art CNN methods by a large margin. We also evaluated the model on ISLES2015-SSIS data set and achieved very competitive performance, which further demonstrated its generalization capacity. The proposed method is fast and accurate, demonstrating a good potential in clinical routines.",Acute ischemic stroke segmentation; DWI; 3D convolutional neural networks; deep learning

Further the objectives were to (1) to study the factor solution of Bush Francis Catatonia Rating Scale (BFCRS); (2) To compare the prevalence and symptom profile of catatonia in patients with psychotic and mood disorders among patients admitted to the psychiatry inpatient of a general hospital psychiatric unit. 201 patients were screened for presence of catatonia by using BFCRS. By using cluster analysis, discriminant analysis, ROC curve, sensitivity and specificity analysis, data suggested that a threshold of 3 symptoms was able to correctly categorize 89.4% of patients with catatonia and 100% of patients without catatonia. Prevalence of catatonia was 9.45%. There was no difference in the prevalence rate and symptom profile of catatonia between those with schizophrenia and mood disorders (i.e., unipolar depression and bipolar affective disorder). Factor analysis of the data yielded 2 factor solutions, i.e., retarded and excited catatonia. To conclude this study suggests that presence of 3 symptoms for making the diagnosis of catatonia can correctly distinguish patients with and without catatonia. This is compatible with the recommendations of DSM-5.

Most existing studies rely on the similar assumption that the heterogeneous units are subject to periodic inspections and identical in terms of their aging situations and the numbers of resisted shocks. In practice, it is often adequate to trigger a unit individually in the event of a single shock, which intensifies the degradation of that unit, accordingly, requiring a sooner inspection to ensure its safety. In this study, the stochastic dependency among units is addressed firstly by introducing a novel activation sequence. Secondly, an adaptive system-level inspection policy is proposed by prioritizing the unit with a worse state. Finally, we take advantage of Monte Carlo methods to simulate the whole process and estimate two objectives, referring to the average system unavailability and maintenance cost, in a designed service time. It is found that the two objectives are contradictory through numerical examples. The Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm III (NSGA-III) algorithm, therefore, has been employed to find the optimal solutions in system unavailability and cost, which provide clues for practitioners in decision-making.",1oo2 configuration; Activation sequence; Adaptive inspection; Maintenance optimization; NSGA-III algorithm; Redundant structure.
930,Combining Individual Travel Preferences Into Destination Prediction: A Multi-Module Deep Learning Network,"Liang, Jian; Tang, Jinjun; Liu, Fang; Wang, Yinhai","Accurate destination prediction over sub-trajectories is essential for a wide range of location-based services. Traditional trip matching methods fail to capture temporal dependence hidden in trajectories and may suffer from data sparsity problems. With the help of massive trajectory data, state-of-the-art approaches based on deep learning (DL) have achieved great success. However, existing DL approaches rarely consider the influence of individual travel preferences in destination prediction. When the trip is long but the known partial trajectory is short, DL models are unable to produce satisfactory results. Thus, we design a feature extraction mechanism to extract useful temporal features, spatial features, and static covariates for destination prediction, among which the spatial features characterize individual travel preferences by considering two main movement patterns in daily travel. Then, a hierarchical model including multiple modules is proposed to finely process heterogeneous features. Extensive experiments conducted on two public datasets demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed model compared to the state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, further experimental results show that the proposed model still performs well when trajectory prefix is short or travel duration is long, which confirms the effectiveness of integrating individual travel preferences.",Trajectory; Feature extraction; Predictive models; Hidden Markov models; Deep learning; Time series analysis; Adaptation models; Destination prediction; deep learning; individual travel preferences; trajectory data mining
931,Caught in the act-Visualizing ribonucleases during eukaryotic ribosome assembly,"Claudia Schneider,Katherine E Bohnsack,Claudia Schneider,Katherine E Bohnsack","Ribosomes are essential macromolecular machines responsible for translating the genetic information encoded in mRNAs into proteins. Ribosomes are composed of ribosomal RNAs and proteins (rRNAs and RPs) and the rRNAs fulfill both catalytic and architectural functions. Excision of the mature eukaryotic rRNAs from their precursor transcript is achieved through a complex series of endoribonucleolytic cleavages and exoribonucleolytic processing steps that are precisely coordinated with other aspects of ribosome assembly. Many ribonucleases involved in pre-rRNA processing have been identified and pre-rRNA processing pathways are relatively well defined. However, momentous advances in cryo-electron microscopy have recently enabled structural snapshots of various pre-ribosomal particles from budding yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) and human cells to be captured and, excitingly, these structures not only allow pre-rRNAs to be observed before and after cleavage events, but also enable ribonucleases to be visualized on their target RNAs. These structural views of pre-rRNA processing in action allow a new layer of understanding of rRNA maturation and how it is coordinated with other aspects of ribosome assembly. They illuminate mechanisms of target recognition by the diverse ribonucleases involved and reveal how the cleavage/processing activities of these enzymes are regulated. In this review, we discuss the new insights into pre-rRNA processing gained by structural analyses and the growing understanding of the mechanisms of ribonuclease regulation.

Its typical application includes the analysis of consumer's materials. Adaptive resonance theory network (ART) is very popular in the unsupervised neural network. Type I adaptive resonance theory network (ART1) deals with the binary numerical data, whereas type II adaptive resonance theory network (ART2) deals with the general numerical data. Several information systems collect the mixing type attitudes, which included numeric attributes and categorical attributes. However, ART1 and ART2 do not deal with mixed data. If the categorical data attributes are transferred to the binary data format, the binary data do not reflect the similar degree. It influences the Clustering quality. Therefore, this paper proposes a modified adaptive resonance theory network (M-ART) and the conceptual hierarchy tree to solve similar degrees of mixed data. This paper Utilizes artificial simulation materials and collects a piece of actual data about the family income to do experiments. The results show that the M-ART algorithm can process the mixed data and has a great effect on clustering. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

However, the deep learning approaches inevitably lose the edge information, which contains spatial features of vessels while performing down-sampling, leading to the limited segmentation performance of fine blood vessels. Furthermore, the existing methods ignore the dynamic topological correlations among feature maps in the deep learning framework, resulting in the inefficient capture of the channel characterization. To address these limitations, we propose a novel dual encoder-based dynamic-channel graph convolutional network with edge enhancement (DE-DCGCN-EE) for retinal vessel segmentation. Specifically, we first design an edge detection-based dual encoder to preserve the edge of vessels in down-sampling. Secondly, we investigate a dynamic-channel graph convolutional network to map the image channels to the topological space and synthesize the features of each channel on the topological map, which solves the limitation of insufficient channel information utilization. Finally, we study an edge enhancement block, aiming to fuse the edge and spatial features in the dual encoder, which is beneficial to improve the accuracy of fine blood vessel segmentation. Competitive experimental results on five retinal image datasets validate the efficacy of the proposed DE-DCGCN-EE, which achieves more remarkable segmentation results against the other state-of-the-art methods, indicating its potential clinical application.",Image edge detection; Biomedical imaging; Image segmentation; Feature extraction; Deep learning; Convolution; Decoding; Retinal vessel segmentation; dual encoder; dynamic graph convolution network; edge enhancement; deep learning

Ranking treatments using both direct and indirect evidence can provide guidance to policy makers and clinicians for making decisions. The purpose of this paper is to introduce fundamental concepts of Bayesian network meta-analysis (BNMA) to researchers in psychology and social sciences. We discuss several essential concepts of BNMA, including the assumptions of homogeneity and consistency, the fixed and random effects models, prior specification, and model fit evaluation strategies, while pointing out some issues and areas where researchers should use caution in the application of BNMA.

Although some progress has been made in chemotherapy and surgery, it is still one of the highest mortalities in the world. Therefore, early detection, diagnosis and treatment are very important to improve the prognosis of patients. In recent years, with the proposal of the concept of radiomics, it has been gradually applied to histopathological grading, differential diagnosis, therapeutic efficacy and prognosis evaluation of gastric cancer, whose advantage is to comprehensively quantify the tumor phenotype using a large number of quantitative image features, so as to predict and diagnose the lesion area of gastric cancer early. The purpose of this review is to evaluate the research status and progress of radiomics in gastric cancer, and reviewed the workflow and clinical application of radiomics. The 27 original studies on the application of radiomics in gastric cancer were included from web of science database search results from 2017 to 2021, the number of patients included ranged from 30 to 1680, and the models used were based on the combination of radiomics signature and clinical factors. Most of these studies showed positive results, the median radiomics quality score (RQS) for all studies was 36.1%, and the development prospect and challenges of radiomics development were prospected.

Specifically, in upsampling path, we introduce two types of contextual modules to model the interdependencies of features in channel and spatial dimensions respectively. The channel contextual module captures image-level semantic information by aggregating the feature maps across spatial dimensions, and clarifies global ambiguity of features. Meanwhile, the spatial contextual module obtains patch-level semantic context by learning a spatial weight map, and enhance the feature discrimination. We embed the two contextual modules into individual components of the decoder network, thus improving the representation power and gaining more precise segment results. Thorough evaluations are performed on four challenging datasets, i.e., PASCAL VOC 2012, ADE20K, PASCAL-Context and Cityscapes dataset.

The prevalence of RTS following ACLR ranges from 71% to 83%. Concerning elements affecting RTS, a limb symmetry index score of 90 or more duplicates the likelihood of RTS and triplicates it when the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) score is 95 or more, irrespective of age. Other elements recognized to be preindicative of RTS at 1 year include complete rehabilitation, age ≤25, and higher IKDC scores. The prevalence of reinjury following ACLR ranges from 1.5% to 37.5% (between 9% and 29% in the majority of reports). It has been published that 1 in 5 individuals suffers reinjury to either knee, and that male individuals are more prone to reinjure following ACLR. The highest percentage of ACLR reinjury happens in younger male (<18 years), being substantially higher than in female of the same age.

Although oxidative stress caused by UVA exposure is assumed to be dependent on skin colour, few studies have demonstrated this dependency. We investigated the effects of skin colour on UVA-induced oxidative stress using ultraweak photon emission (UPE) generated from the skin during oxidation processes. The UPE intensities of skin samples were detected using a photomultiplier tube every second without any labelling. We irradiated skin tissue of different colours with UVA and measured UPE over time. UVA-induced UPE could be detected from immediately after irradiation to 2 h after irradiation, indicating persistent oxidative stress. Skin lightness (L*) positively correlates with UPE intensity. Lighter-coloured skin exhibited more UVA-induced UPE, indicating higher oxidative stress. Additionally, oxidative stress persisted significantly more in lighter skin compared with darker skin. Skin tissues exhibited pigment darkening after UVA irradiation. Our results suggest that skin lightness affects oxidative stress induced by UV irradiation. Our study demonstrated the relationship between skin lightness and UVA-induced oxidative stress for the first time and offers new photodermatological insights into the human skin.",optics and photonics; oxidative stress; skin aging; skin pigmentation; ultraviolet rays.

With recent developments in deep learning, state-of-the-art performance can now be achieved using a single 2D-RGB-camera-based gait analysis system, offering an objective assessment of gait-related pathologies. Such systems provide a valuable complement/alternative to the current standard practice of subjective assessment. Most 2D-RGB-camera-based gait analysis approaches rely on compact gait representations, such as the gait energy image, which summarize the characteristics of a walking sequence into one single image. However, such compact representations do not fully capture the temporal information and dependencies between successive gait movements. This limitation is addressed by proposing a spatiotemporal deep learning approach that uses a selection of key frames to represent a gait cycle. Convolutional and recurrent deep neural networks were combined, processing each gait cycle as a collection of silhouette key frames, allowing the system to learn temporal patterns among the spatial features extracted at individual time instants. Trained with gait sequences from the GAIT-IT dataset, the proposed system is able to improve gait pathology classification accuracy, outperforming state-of-the-art solutions and achieving improved generalization on cross-dataset tests.",gait analysis; gait pathology classification; deep learning; computer vision

947,Nested mechanosensory feedback actively damps visually guided head movements in Drosophila,"Benjamin Cellini,Jean-Michel Mongeau,Benjamin Cellini,Jean-Michel Mongeau","Executing agile locomotion requires animals to integrate sensory feedback, often from multiple sources. For example, human gaze is mediated by multiple feedback loops that integrate visual and vestibular information. A central challenge in studying biological feedback loops is that they are nested and dynamically coupled. Here, we develop a framework based on control theory for unraveling nested feedback systems and apply it to study gaze stabilization in the fruit fly (Drosophila). By combining experimental and mathematical methods to manipulate control topologies, we uncovered the role of body-generated mechanosensory feedback nested within visual feedback in the control of head movements. We discovered that visual feedback changed the tuning of head movements across visual motion frequencies whereas mechanosensory feedback damped head movements. Head saccades had slower dynamics when the body was free to move, further pointing to the role of damping via mechanosensory feedback. By comparing head responses between self-generated and externally generated body motion, we revealed a nonlinear gating of mechanosensory feedback that is motor-context dependent. Altogether, our findings reveal the role of nested feedback loops in flies and uncover mechanisms that reconcile differences in head kinematics between body-free and body-fixed flies. Our framework is generalizable to biological and robotic systems relying on nested feedback control for guiding locomotion.",D. melanogaster; Drosophila; control theory; insect flight; neuroscience; physics of living systems; proprioception; sensory fusion; vision.
948,Self-Supervised Attention Mechanism for Pediatric Bone Age Assessment With Efficient Weak Annotation,"Liu, Chuanbin; Xie, Hongtao; Zhang, Yongdong","Pediatric bone age assessment (BAA) is a common clinical practice to investigate endocrinology, genetic and growth disorders of children. Different specific bone parts are extracted as anatomical Regions of Interest (RoIs) during this task, since their morphological characters have important biological identification in skeletal maturity. Following this clinical prior knowledge, recently developed deep learning methods address BAA with an RoI-based attention mechanism, which segments or detects the discriminative RoIs for meticulous analysis. Great strides have been made, however, these methods strictly require large and precise RoIs annotations, which limits the real-world clinical value. To overcome the severe requirements on RoIs annotations, in this paper, we propose a novel self-supervised learning mechanism to effectively discover the informative RoIs without the need of extra knowledge and precise annotation-only image-level weak annotation is all we take. Our model, termed PEAR-Net for Part Extracting and Age Recognition Network, consists of one Part Extracting (PE) agent for discriminative RoIs discovering and one Age Recognition (AR) agent for age assessment. Without precise supervision, the PE agent is designed to discover and extract RoIs fully automatically. Then the proposed RoIs are fed into AR agent for feature learning and age recognition. Furthermore, we utilize the self-consistency of RoIs to optimize PE agent to understand the part relation and select the most useful RoIs. With this self-supervised design, the PE agent and AR agent can reinforce each other mutually. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first end-to-end bone age assessment method which can discover RoIs automatically with only image-level annotation. We conduct extensive experiments on the public RSNA 2017 dataset and achieve state-of-the-art performance with MAE 3.99 months.

After presenting the state of the art, we focus on nearest neighbor regression methods, which are data-driven algorithms that are effective yet simple to implement. We try to strengthen their efficacy in two ways that are little explored in literature, i.e., by adopting a multivariate approach and by adding awareness of the time of the day. The combination of these two refinements, which represents a novelty, leads to the definition of a new class of methods that we call time-aware multivariate nearest neighbor regression (TaM-NNR) algorithms. To assess this class, we have used publicly available traffic data from a California highway. Computational results show the effectiveness of such algorithms in comparison with state-of-the-art parametric and non-parametric methods. In particular, they consistently perform better than their corresponding standard univariate versions. These facts highlight the importance of context elements in traffic prediction. The ideas presented here may be further investigated considering more context elements (e.g., weather conditions), more complex road topologies (e.g., urban networks), and different types of prediction methods.",Traffic flow prediction; nearest neighbor regression; multivariate analysis; context awareness; pattern recognition algorithm; Bayesian networks

We examined the intrinsic connectivity during rest within and between these networks. Six-minute resting-state scans were obtained. Using a network-based approach, connectivity within and between the dorsal and ventral attention, the default mode and the salience networks was compared between the ADHD and control group. The ADHD group displayed hyperconnectivity between the two attention networks and within the default mode and ventral attention network. The salience network was hypoconnected to the dorsal attention network. There were trends towards hyperconnectivity within the dorsal attention network and between the salience and ventral attention network in ADHD. Connectivity within and between other networks was unrelated to ADHD. Our findings highlight the altered connectivity within and between attention networks, and between them and the salience network in ADHD. One hypothesis to be tested in future studies is that individuals with ADHD are affected by an imbalance between ventral and dorsal attention systems with the former playing a dominant role during task engagement, making individuals with ADHD highly susceptible to distraction by salient task-irrelevant stimuli.",ADHD; Brain networks; Connectivity; Resting state; fMRI.
951,Video Captioning Using Global-Local Representation,"Yan, Liqi; Ma, Siqi; Wang, Qifan; Chen, Yingjie; Zhang, Xiangyu; Savakis, Andreas; Liu, Dongfang","Video captioning is a challenging task as it needs to accurately transform visual understanding into natural language description. To date, state-of-the-art methods inadequately model global-local vision representation for sentence generation, leaving plenty of room for improvement. In this work, we approach the video captioning task from a new perspective and propose a GLR framework, namely a global-local representation granularity. Our GLR demonstrates three advantages over the prior efforts. First, we propose a simple solution, which exploits extensive vision representations from different video ranges to improve linguistic expression. Second, we devise a novel global-local encoder, which encodes different video representations including long-range, short-range and local-keyframe, to produce rich semantic vocabulary for obtaining a descriptive granularity of video contents across frames. Finally, we introduce the progressive training strategy which can effectively organize feature learning to incur optimal captioning behavior. Evaluated on the MSR-VTT and MSVD dataset, we outperform recent state-of-the-art methods including a well-tuned SA-LSTM baseline by a significant margin, with shorter training schedules. Because of its simplicity and efficacy, we hope that our GLR could serve as a strong baseline for many video understanding tasks besides video captioning.

952,Generative Consistency for Semi-Supervised Cerebrovascular Segmentation From TOF-MRA,"Chen, Cheng; Zhou, Kangneng; Wang, Zhiliang; Xiao, Ruoxiu","Cerebrovascular segmentation from Time-of-flight magnetic resonance angiography (TOF-MRA) is a critical step in computer-aided diagnosis. In recent years, deep learning models have proved its powerful feature extraction for cerebrovascular segmentation. However, they require many labeled datasets to implement effective driving, which are expensive and professional. In this paper, we propose a generative consistency for semi-supervised (GCS) model. Considering the rich information contained in the feature map, the GCS model utilizes the generation results to constrain the segmentation model. The generated data comes from labeled data, unlabeled data, and unlabeled data after perturbation, respectively. The GCS model also calculates the consistency of the perturbed data to improve the feature mining ability. Subsequently, we propose a new model as the backbone of the GSC model. It transfers TOF-MRA into graph space and establishes correlation using Transformer. We demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed model on TOF-MRA representations, and tested the GCS model with state-of-the-art semi-supervised methods using the proposed model as backbone. The experiments prove the important role of the GCS model in cerebrovascular segmentation.

953,Fast Blind Image Deblurring Using Smoothing-Enhancing Regularizer,"Dou, Zeyang; Gao, Kun; Zhang, Xiaodian; Wang, Hong","Blind deconvolution is a highly ill-posed problem for the restoration of degraded images and requires prior knowledge or regularization. Recently, various priors have been proposed and the models based on these priors have achieved state-of-the-art performances. In this paper, we present a blind image deblurring method based on a computationally efficient and effective image regularizer. The proposed regularizer is motivated by the fact that the success of recent priors mainly stems from their properties, which implicitly generate an unnatural latent image suppressing insignificant structures and preserving only salient edges. These salient edges guide the models to estimate an accurate kernel. In this paper, the proposed regularizer termed smoothing-enhancing regularizer, not only assures that only salient structures in the image are preserved but also enhances these salient structures to help the model estimate the more accurate kernel. To efficiently solve the proposed model, we develop an efficient numerical approach based on the half-quadratic splitting algorithm and the lagged-fixed-point iteration scheme. The optimization scheme only requires a few additional shrinkage operations compared with the original half-quadratic splitting algorithm, making our method much faster than recent leading methods. The qualitative and quantitative experimental results show that our algorithm achieves the state-of-the-art results and can be extended to other challenging deblurring tasks, such as those involving text, face, and low-illuminated images. Furthermore, the proposed method is much more computationally efficient than the recent state-of-the-art algorithms with up to more than 10x faster execution time.",Blind restoration; motion deblur; half quadratic splitting; smoothing-enhancing regularizer

In this work we study such tradeoffs, first in a general and then in a mobile wireless setting. In the general setting, we capture the tradeoff between the delivery delay of a packet and its transportation cost (which comprises a transmission component and a storage component) on the cost-delay plane using the Optimal Cost/Delay Curve (OC/DC), for the case when the packet follows optimal routes, and the Achievable Cost/Delay Curve (AC/DC), for the case when a specific (suboptimal) routing protocol is used. Applying the framework of the general setting to mobile wireless DTNs, we evaluate a novel set of geographic routing protocols with delay-tolerant features against both state-of-the-art routing protocols (using their respective average AC/DCs) and also optimal routing (described in terms of the average OC/DC). Compared to the state-of-the-art protocols, our protocols are shown to achieve cost/delay tradeoffs much closer to the optimal one. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

955,Dephenolization pyrolysis fluid improved physicochemical properties and microbial community structure of saline-alkali soils,"Shuai Wang,Hanyu Chang,Zhenfei Dong,Yansen Ren,Tianle Tan,Hui Deng,Shuai Wang,Hanyu Chang,Zhenfei Dong,Yansen Ren,Tianle Tan,Hui Deng","Saline-sodic soil is widely distributed around the world and has induced severe impacts on ecosystems and agriculture. Biomass pyrolysis fluid (BPF), as a substance rich in organic acids, has been proposed as a saline-alkali soil conditioner. One of the main problems with BPF applications is the potential contamination of the phenolic substances it contains. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to reduce the phenolic substances in BFP and study the improvement effect of BFP on saline-alkali soil. Firstly, we explored the physicochemical properties of BPF prepared at different temperatures (300 °C, 400 °C, 500 °C, 600 °C, and 700 °C). Then BPF was separated into upper phases (UP) and lower phases (LP) by a simple one-step salting-out extraction method. We found that phenolic substances were mainly concentrated in the UP (average content was 193.27 mg/g), and the content of phenolic substances in the LP was effectively reduced (average content was 64.52 mg/g). Next, we added the LP diluted at different times (0, 50, 100, 200, 400) into saline-alkali soil for improvement experiments. The experimental results show that the lower phase diluted 400 times at the pyrolysis temperature of 500℃ was added into saline-alkali soil, which greatly increased the content of soil available nutrients. Under the action of organic acids, soil pH (the average was 7.43) and total salt content could be reduced effectively, and soil enzyme activities can be increased. Microbial community analysis showed that the addition of LP could increase the proportion of Actinomycetes, which played a beneficial role in improving soil fertility and then improved the growth of Chinese cabbage.",Biomass pyrolysis fluids; Enzyme activity; Microorganisms; Saline-alkali soil; Salting-out extraction; Soil remediation.

Herein, the micro-coordination environment of Al in commercial Y zeolite was regulated by a specific dealumination method and then the dealuminated Y zeolite was used as the support of Cu-Mn oxides. The optimized catalyst Cu-Mn/DY exhibited excellent performance with around 95% of toluene removal at 30 °C. Besides, the catalyst delivered satisfactory stability in both high-humidity conditions and long-term reactions, which is attributed to more active oxygen vacancies and acidic sites, especially the strong Lewis acid sites newly formed in the catalyst. The decrease in the electron cloud density around aluminum species enhanced electron transfer at the interface between Cu-Mn oxides. Moreover, extra-framework octahedrally coordinated Al in the support promoted the electronic metal-support interaction (EMSI). Compared with single Mn catalysts, the incorporation of the Cu component changed the degradation pathway of toluene. Benzoic acid, as the intermediate of toluene oxidation, can directly ring-open on Cu-doped catalysts rather than being further oxidized to other byproducts, which increased the rate of the catalytic reaction. This work provides a new insight and theoretical guidance into the rational design of efficient catalysts for the catalytic ozonation of VOCs.",Cu−Mn oxides; VOCs; catalytic ozonation; dealumination; interface effect.
957,Toward Accurate Binarized Neural Networks With Sparsity for Mobile Application,"Wang, Peisong; He, Xiangyu; Cheng, Jian","While binarized neural networks (BNNs) have attracted great interest, popular approaches proposed so far mainly exploit the symmetric sign function for feature binarization, i.e., to binarize activations into -1 and +1 with a fixed threshold of 0. However, whether this option is optimal has been largely overlooked. In this work, we propose the Sparsity-inducing BNN (Si-BNN) to quantize the activations to be either 0 or +1, which better approximates ReLU using 1-bit. We further introduce trainable thresholds into the backward function of binarization to guide the gradient propagation. Our method dramatically outperforms the current state-of-the-art, lowering the performance gap between full-precision networks and BNNs on mainstream architectures, achieving the new state-of-the-art on binarized AlexNet (Top-1 50.5%), ResNet-18 (Top-1 62.2%), and ResNet-50 (Top-1 68.3%). At inference time, Si-BNN still enjoys the high efficiency of bit-wise operations.

958,Modified Dolphin Swarm Algorithm Based on Chaotic Maps for Solving High-Dimensional Function Optimization Problems,"Qiao, Weibiao; Yang, Zhe","In 2016, dolphin swarm algorithm (DSA) that has received sustained research interest due to its simplicity and effectiveness was proposed. However, when solving high-dimensional function optimization problems, DSA is prone to fall into local optimization problems, which leads to low optimization accuracy or even failure. In this paper, to solve this problem, chaotic mapping is introduced into DSA, and chaotic dolphin swarm algorithm (CDSA) is successfully proposed. Based on high-dimensional Rastrigin function, the optimal chaotic map is determined among eight chaotic maps (e.g., Logistic). Then, in view of high-dimensional Levy function, Rotated Hyper-Ellipsoid function and Sum Squares function respectively, the performance of CDSA and that of the state-of-the-art algorithms (e.g. (whale optimization algorithm) WOA) are compared. The results show that the performance of CDSA based on Kent map is best and the performance of CDSA outperform that of the state-of-the-art algorithms considered to be compared. Finally, it is concluded that such a new meta-heuristic algorithm could help to improve the shortcomings of DSA and increase the applied range of DSA.",Chaotic maps; dolphin swarm algorithm; high-dimensional function; optimization
959,"Geoelectric investigations into sandstone moisture regimes: Implications for rock weathering and the deterioration of San Rock Art in the Golden Gate Reserve, South Africa","Mol, L.; Viles, H. A.","The Clarens sandstone in the Golden Gate Reserve, South Africa, is the canvas for a collection of San (Bushmen) Rock Art, dating from Neolithic times until as recently as 150 years ago. This Rock Art is under threat from human interference but also, to a greater degree, from weathering processes on the rock surface. The dominant weathering processes occurring in the rock shelters which host the Rock Art are flaking and honeycombing. Two rock shelter sites in the Reserve have been investigated using electric resistivity tomography (ERT) and supportive methods for measuring surface moisture (Protimeter) and surface hardness (Equotip). These non-destructive techniques can be used in situ to assess the extent of weathering within a rock outcrop and are especially suited for investigations in sensitive areas such as Rock Art sites. Moisture movement has been mapped and related to the weathering processes observed on the surface. The aim of the study is to aid Rock Art conservation in the Golden Gate Reserve through a better understanding of the driving processes of surface weathering. The evidence shows that the extensive flaking and honeycombing found in the rock shelters is most likely caused by water pockets in the near-surface zone, which are replenished through internal moisture transport, driving the superficial weathering processes. These weathering processes pose a significant problem: Rock Art in the Golden Gate Reserve shows severe deterioration due to flaking. Conservation strategies should therefore take internal processes into account as much as their superficial expression. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

A circular transformation is designed to capture both the circular shape of the OD and the image variation across the OD boundary simultaneously. For each retinal image pixel, it evaluates the image variation along multiple evenly-oriented radial line segments of specific length. The pixels with the maximum variation along all radial line segments are determined, which can be further exploited to locate both the OD center and the OD boundary accurately. Experiments show that OD detection accuracies of 99.75%, 97.5%, and 98.77% are obtained for the STARE dataset, the ARIA dataset, and the MES-SIDOR dataset, respectively, and the OD center error lies around six pixels for the STARE dataset and the ARIA dataset which is much smaller than that of state-of-the-art methods ranging 14-29 pixels. In addition, the OD segmentation accuracies of 93.4% and 91.7% are obtained for STARE dataset and ARIA dataset, respectively, that consists of many severely degraded images of pathological retinas that state-of-the-art methods cannot segment properly.

Currently, the main stream low-dose CT methods include vendor-specific sinogram domain filtration and iterative reconstruction algorithms, but they need to access raw data, whose formats are not transparent to most users. Due to the difficulty of modeling the statistical characteristics in the image domain, the existing methods for directly processing reconstructed images cannot eliminate image noise very well while keeping structural details. Inspired by the idea of deep learning, here we combine the autoencoder, deconvolution network, and shortcut connections into the residual encoder-decoder convolutional neural network (RED-CNN) for low-dose CT imaging. After patch-based training, the proposed RED-CNN achieves a competitive performance relative to the-state-of-art methods in both simulated and clinical cases.

The inoculation of tropical tree seedlings with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AM fungi) can improve tree growth and viability, but efficiency may depend on plant and AM fungal genotype. To study such effects, seven phylogenetically diverse AM fungi, native to Ecuador, from seven genera and a non-native AM fungus (Rhizophagus irregularis DAOM197198) were used to inoculate the tropical potential crop tree (PCT) species Handroanthus chrysanthus (synonym Tabebuia chrysantha), Cedrela montana, and Heliocarpus americanus. Twenty-four plant-fungus combinations were studied in five different fertilization and AMF inoculation treatments. Numerous plant growth parameters and mycorrhizal root colonization were assessed. The inoculation with any of the tested AM fungi improved seedling growth significantly and in most cases reduced plant mortality. Plants produced up to threefold higher biomass, when compared to the standard nursery practice. AM fungal inoculation alone or in combination with low fertilization both outperformed full fertilization in terms of plant growth promotion. Interestingly, root colonization levels for individual fungi strongly depended on the host tree species, but surprisingly the colonization strength did not correlate with plant growth promotion. The combination of AM fungal inoculation with a low dosage of slow release fertilizer improved PCT seedling performance strongest, but also AM fungal treatments without any fertilization were highly efficient. The AM fungi tested are promising candidates to improve management practices in tropical tree seedling production.",Afforestation; Andes; Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AM fungi); Plant growth promotion; Tree nursery; Tropical tree seedlings.

968,Beyond feature integration: a coarse-to-fine framework for cascade correlation tracking,"Li, Dongdong; Wen, Gongjian; Kuai, Yangliu; Porikli, Fatih","Discriminative correlation filters (DCF) have achieved enormous popularity in the tracking community. Recently, the performance advancement in DCF-based trackers is predominantly driven by the use of convolutional features. In pursuit of extreme tracking performance, state-of-the-art trackers (e.g., cascade correlation tracking [1] and HCF [2]) equip DCF with hierarchical convolutional features to capture both semantics and spatial details of the target appearance. While such methods have been shown to work well, multiple feature integration results in high model complexity which significantly increases the over-fitting risk and computational burden. In this paper, we present a coarse-to-fine framework for cascade correlation tracking (CCT). Instead of integrating hierarchical features, this framework decomposes a complicated tracker into two low-complexity modules, a coarse tracker and a refined tracker , working in a coarse-to-fine manner. The coarse tracker employs low-resolution semantic convolutional features extracted from a large search area to cope with large target displacement and appearance change between adjacent frames. By contrast, the refined tracker employs high-resolution handcraft features extracted from a small search area to further refine the coarse location of .

Based on N-Net, a temporal correlation among the phase-resolved images is also considered by the proposed CycN-Net. Extensive experiments on both XCAT simulation data and real patient 4D CBCT datasets were carried out to verify the feasibility of the proposed CNNs. Both networks can effectively suppress streaking artifacts and noise while restoring the distinct features simultaneously, compared with the existing CNN models and two state-of-the-art iterative algorithms. Moreover, the proposed method is robust in handling complicated tasks of various patient datasets and imaging devices, which implies its excellent generalization ability.",Image reconstruction; Computed tomography; Logic gates; Image restoration; Imaging; Training; Correlation; 4D cone-beam computed tomography (4D CBCT); artifact reduction; deep learning; prior knowledge; spatiotemporal resolution

974,FPGA implementation of a low-power and area-efficient state-table-based compression algorithm for DSLR cameras,"Lone, Mohd Rafi; Hakim, Najeeb-ud-Din","Small image acquisition devices like digital single lens reflex (DSLR) cameras most commonly use Joint Photographic Expects Group (JPEG) coding standard for lossy compression. Although JPEG is a simple coding standard, its compression efficiency is very low as compared to any typical state-of-the-art image coding standards like set partitioning in hierarchical trees (SPIRT). In this paper, a novel state-table-based SPIRT (STS) algorithm and its field programmable gate array (FPGA) implementation is proposed. The STS uses two small state-tables and two extremely small lists. The STS not only provides better compression efficiency than the state-of-the-art JPEG 2000 at high bit rates but also requires very small memory to hold the state-tables and lists in comparison to SPIRT. On average STS requires 0.86% of the memory needed by SPIRT when evaluated for image sizes ranging from 4 Mpixels to 40 Mpixels. The implementation results show that STS consumes very less FPGA area in comparison to SPIRT-based architectures. The dynamic power dissipation of STS is also less than that of JPEG-like compression standards. This makes our proposed algorithm a better candidate for compression in low-power, low-memory digital image acquisition devices.",Set partitioning in hierarchical trees; very large-scale integration; image compression; dynamic power dissipation; field programmable logic array; digital single lens reflex
975,Right Ventricular Limitation: A Tale of Two Elastances,"Sheldon Magder,Douglas Slobod,Nawaporn Assanangkornchai,Sheldon Magder,Douglas Slobod,Nawaporn Assanangkornchai","Right ventricular (RV) dysfunction is a commonly considered cause of low cardiac output in critically ill patients. Its management can be difficult and requires an understanding of how the RV limits cardiac output. We explain that RV stroke output is caught between the passive elastance of the RV walls during diastolic filling and the active elastance produced by the RV in systole. These two elastances limit RV filling and stroke volume and consequently limit left ventricular stroke volume. We emphasize the use of the term ""RV limitation"" and argue that limitation of RV filling is the primary pathophysiological process by which the RV causes hemodynamic instability. Importantly, RV limitation can be present even when RV function is normal. We use the term ""RV dysfunction"" to indicate that RV end-systolic elastance is depressed or diastolic elastance is increased. When RV dysfunction is present, RV limitation occurs at lowerpulmonary valve opening pressures and lower stroke volume, but stroke volume and cardiac output still can be maintained until RV filling is limited. We use the term ""RV failure"" to indicate the condition in which RV output is insufficient for tissue needs. We discuss the physiological underpinnings of these terms and implications for clinical management.",cardiac output; pulmonary pressure; pulmonary vascular resistance; shock; stroke volume.
976,Integrating Graph Partitioning and Matching for Trajectory Analysis in Video Surveillance,"Lin, Liang; Lu, Yongyi; Pan, Yan; Chen, Xiaowu","In order to track moving objects in long range against occlusion, interruption, and background clutter, this paper proposes a unified approach for global trajectory analysis. Instead of the traditional frame-by-frame tracking, our method recovers target trajectories based on a short sequence of video frames, e.g., 15 frames. We initially calculate a foreground map at each frame obtained from a state-of-the-art background model. An attribute graph is then extracted from the foreground map, where the graph vertices are image primitives represented by the composite features. With this graph representation, we pose trajectory analysis as a joint task of spatial graph partitioning and temporal graph matching. The task can be formulated by maximizing a posteriori under the Bayesian framework, in which we integrate the spatio-temporal contexts and the appearance models. The probabilistic inference is achieved by a data-driven Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm. Given a period of observed frames, the algorithm simulates an ergodic and aperiodic Markov chain, and it visits a sequence of solution states in the joint space of spatial graph partitioning and temporal graph matching. In the experiments, our method is tested on several challenging videos from the public datasets of visual surveillance, and it outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.",Graph partitioning and matching; multiple object tracking; trajectory analysis; video surveillance
977,Extraordinary Creatures: The Role of Birds in Early Iron Age Slovenia,"Frie, Adrienne C.","Depictions of birds are overrepresented in the Dolenjska Hallstatt culture, and appear on over a quarter of artefacts depicting animals. A wide variety of artefacts with birds have been found primarily in graves, and crosscut gender, status, and age. However, poor preservation of zooarchaeological remains has made reconstructions of lived human-bird interactions difficult. This study uses ecological and ethological data, combined with local imagery, to provide insight into prehistoric human-bird interfaces in this area, and the cultural conceptions surrounding these interactions. Birds would have been a constant presence in the lives of Dolenjska Hallstatt people; however, human relationships with them were based more on observation than direct interaction. Birds were ubiquitous in imagery, and it is proposed that this stemmed from Dolenjska Hallstatt conceptions of birds as important observers of human actions, ritual mediators, and possibly guides or guardians. Their differences from humans and other animals distinguished them - they were set apart, and depictions highlighted non-normative behaviours. Birds in the Dolenjska Hallstatt worldview were more than animals, ascribed extraordinary capabilities that made them ritually potent and richly symbolic creatures.",Early Iron Age; Hallstatt period; birds; prehistoric art; situla art; human-animal relationships

Information regarding flood effects on food security is of particular importance for humanitarian organizations and is especially valuable across Africa's rural areas that contribute to regional food supplies. We quantitatively evaluate where and to what extent flooding impacts food security across Africa, using a Granger causality analysis and panel modeling approaches. Within our modeled areas, we find that ∼12% of the people that experienced food insecurity from 2009 to 2020 had their food security status affected by flooding. Furthermore, flooding and its associated meteorological conditions can simultaneously degrade food security locally while enhancing it at regional spatial scales, leading to large variations in overall food security outcomes. Dedicated data collection at the intersection of flood events and associated food security measures across different spatial and temporal scales are required to better characterize the extent of flood impact and inform preparedness, response, and recovery needs.",Africa; disaster; extremes; floods; food security.

An education in healthy habits from early ages to increase children's physical and mental well-being together with their level of cultural knowledge contributes to the acquisition of a Leisure Culture that allows children to perceive the close environment as a scene for learning and enjoyment. It is thus be necessary for schools to foster pedagogical experiences, taking the physical and cultural environment as teaching resources. An innovation project is proposed which will be implemented with 25 university students from the School of Teacher Training and Education at the University of Oviedo (Oviedo, Spain). The project will consist of the proposal of educational itineraries through the city of Oviedo and Mount Naranco. As teachers-to-be, students must combine knowledge of the related areas and generate inter-disciplinary activities throughout the routes that will foster respect for the environment and leisure based on culture and physical activity, attitudes that they will transmit to their own students in the future.",education; teacher training; interdisciplinary; social sciences; art; physical education; leisure culture; educational itineraries

Each temporal-domain MR image is viewed as a point that lies onto or close to a smooth manifold, and landmark points are identified to describe the point cloud concisely. To facilitate computations, a dimensionality reduction module generates low-dimensional/compressed renditions of the landmark points. Recovery of high-fidelity MRI data is realized by solving a non-convex minimization task for the linear decompression operator and affine combinations of landmark points which locally approximate the latent manifold geometry. An algorithm with guaranteed convergence to stationary solutions of the non-convex minimization task is also provided. The aforementioned framework exploits the underlying spatio-temporal patterns and geometry of the acquired data without any prior training on external data or information. Extensive numerical results on simulated as well as real cardiac-cine MRI data illustrate noteworthy improvements of the advocated machine-learning framework over state-of-the-art reconstruction techniques.",Magnetic resonance imaging; Manifolds; Task analysis; Data models; Image reconstruction; Dimensionality reduction; Laplace equations; Dynamic MRI; manifold learning; low rank; sparsity; dimensionality reduction

The mixing and segregation phenomenon occur in most systems of granular solids and have a significant influence on the quality and outcome of the final product. The usual approach to mix the powders is by using a tumbling blender which rotates around one axis, where, the radial convection is reported to be faster than axial dispersion transport, hindering the mixing performance. A double cone mixer is fabricated which rotates around two axes, causing axial mixing competitive to its radial counterpart. Samples are collected intrusively using the discrete pocket samplers to quantify the characteristics of mixing for millimeter sized glass beads. Digital video recording and MATLAB based image analysis techniques are used for non-intrusive characterization of mixing in micron sized art sands. A parametric study of the effect of particle size, vessel speeds on the granular mixing is accomplished. Incorporation of dual axis rotation enhances axial mixing by 70-90% in comparison to single axis rotation. Particles of smaller sizes (art sand) tend to mix quicker than the bigger particles (glass beads) due to mild cohesive effects. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

982,DESCNet: Developing Efficient Scratchpad Memories for Capsule Network Hardware,"Marchisio, Alberto; Mrazek, Vojtech; Hanif, Muhammad Abdullah; Shafique, Muhammad","Deep neural networks (DNNs) have been established as the state-of-the-art method for advanced machine learning applications. Recently proposed by the Google Brain's team, the capsule networks (CapsNets) have improved the generalization ability, as compared to DNNs, due to their multidimensional capsules and preserving the spatial relationship between different objects. However, they pose significantly high computational and memory requirements, making their energy-efficient inference a challenging task. This article provides, for the first time, an in-depth analysis to highlight the design and runtime challenges for the (on-chip scratchpad) memories deployed in hardware accelerators executing fast CapsNets inference. To enable an efficient design, we propose an application-specific memory architecture, called DESCNet, which minimizes the off-chip memory accesses, while efficiently feeding the data to the hardware accelerator executing CapsNets inference. We analyze the corresponding on-chip memory requirement and leverage it to propose a methodology for exploring different scratchpad memory (SPM) designs and their energy/area tradeoffs. Afterward, an application-specific power-gating technique for the on-chip SPM is employed to further reduce its energy consumption, depending upon the mapped dataflow of the CapsNet and the utilization across different operations of its processing. We integrated our DESCNet memory design, as well as another state-of-the-art memory design Marchisio et al. [2018] for comparison studies, with an opensource DNN accelerator executing Google's CapsNet model Sabour et al. [2017] for the MNIST dataset. We also enhanced the design to execute the recent deep CapsNet model Rajasegaran et al. [2019] for the CIFAR10 dataset. Note: we use the same benchmarks and test conditions for which these CapsNets have been proposed and evaluated by their respective teams. The complete hardware is synthesized for a 32-nm CMOS technology using the ASIC-design flow with Synopsys tools and CACTI-P, and detailed area, performance, and power/energy estimation is performed using different configurations. Our results for a selected Pareto-optimal solution demonstrate no performance loss and an energy reduction of 79% for the complete accelerator, including computational units and memories, when compared to the state-of-the-art design.",Memory management; Hardware; System-on-chip; Two dimensional displays; Memory architecture; Routing; Capsule networks (CapsNets); design space exploration (DSE); energy efficiency; machine learning (ML); memory design; memory management; performance; power gating; scratchpad memory (SPM); special-purpose hardware

Methods: A multistage cluster random sampling method was adopted to recruit 600 adolescents with equal sex distribution in the city of Kerman/southeast of Iran. Decayed, Missing and Filled Teeth (DMFT) and Tooth Wear Index (TWI) were recorded for each subject. Snacking and breakfast quality, frequency of snacking and regular/irregular use of main meals were also recorded. Poisson regression and Firth's bias-reduced penalized-likelihood logistic regression were used for data analysis. Results: DMFT score of adolescents who consumed low-quality snacks were 1.13 times more than those who consumed high-quality snacks. Regular use of all three main meals was associated with a lower DMFT score. DMFT score of adolescents who did not have regular use of breakfast was 1.19 times more than those who consumed breakfast on a regular basis. Also, regarding adolescents who had an irregular use of lunch, the DMFT score was 1.3 times more than those who had a regular lunch schedule. In addition, participants with irregular dinner consumption had 1.24 times more DMFT scores compared to those with a regular dinner schedule. Conclusions: Regular breakfast consumption, decreased snacking occasions, use of higher nutritional quality snacks, and increased nutritional education are important in order to prevent a higher chance of dental caries and promote dental health status.",Food quality; breakfast; dental caries; meals; snacks; tooth erosion.

An extremely high incidence of essential hypertension was found in the Han and the Yugur people who resided in Sunan County in China's nomadic steppes, with little population movement. To investigate gut microbial contributions to this high incidence of hypertension, we recruited a total of 1, 242 Yugur and Han people, who had resided in Sunan County for more than 15 years and accounted for 3% of the local population. The epidemiological survey of 1,089 individuals indicated their nearly 1.8-times-higher prevalence of hypertension (38.2 to 43.3%) than the average in China (23.2%), under a special high-calorie diet based on wheat, cattle, mutton, and animal offal. Investigations of the fecal microbiota of another cohort of 153 individuals revealed that certain Lachnospiraceae genera were positively correlated with high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) but negatively correlated with systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP). HDL-C was negatively correlated with SBP and DBP. We further observed that the serum butyrate content was lower in both Han and Yugur people with hypertension than in those without hypertension. This study gives novel insight into the role of gut microbial dysbiosis in hypertension modulation under a high-calorie diet, where the notable depletion of Lachnospiraceae genera might lead to less production of butyrate, contributing to the lower level of HDL-C and elevating blood pressure in hypertension. IMPORTANCE Dietary nutrients can be converted by the gut microbiota into metabolites such as short-chain fatty acids, which may serve as disease-preventing agents in hypertension. Due to the limited population mobility and unique high-calorie dietary habits, the cohort of this study can serve as a representative cohort for elucidating the associations between the gut microbiota and hypertension under a high-calorie diet. Moreover, low levels of HDL-C have previously been associated with an increased risk of various cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). Our findings provide new insight showing that low levels of HDL-C may be a potential medium between the depletion of Lachnospiraceae genera and hypertension under a high-calorie diet, which might also be a potential candidate for other CVDs.",Lachnospiraceae; butyrate; ethnic group; gut microbiota; high-calorie diet; high-density lipoprotein cholesterol; hypertension; systolic blood pressure.

However, there is a dispute about how to construct the storylines in a traceable, consistent, comprehensive, and reproducible way. This study aims to support energy researchers considering the use of the concept of socio-technical scenarios in two ways: first, we provide a state-of-the-art analysis of socio-technical energy scenario construction by comparing 16 studies with respect to five categories.

This problem has drawn much attention due to a large number of applications. The state-of-the-art method for this problem suffers from low efficiency. To enable fast verifiable pattern matching, we propose a novel scheme in this paper. Our scheme is based on an ordered set accumulator data structure and a newly developed verifiable suffix array structure, which only involves fast cryptographic hash computations. Our scheme also supports fast multiple-occurrence pattern matching. A striking feature of our proposed scheme is that our scheme works even with no secret keys, which ensures public verifiability. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the proposed scheme using Java. The results show that our scheme is orders of magnitude faster than the state-of-the-art work. Specifically, our scheme with public verifiability only costs a preprocessing time of 47 s (merely one-time off-line cost during outsourcing), a search time of 30 mu s, a verification time of 149 mu s, and a proof size of 2760 bytes for a verifiable pattern matching query with pattern length 200 on 10-million long textual data which consists of sequences of two-byte, Unicode characters in Java.",Pattern matching outsourcing; verifiability; accumulator; hashing

In particular, RoR adds levelwise shortcut connections upon original residual networks to promote the learning capability of residual networks. More importantly, RoR can be applied to various kinds of residual networks (ResNets, Pre-ResNets, and WRN) and significantly boost their performance. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and versatility of RoR, where it achieves the best performance in all residual-networklike structures. Our RoR-3-WRN58-4 + SD models achieve new state-of-the-art results on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and SVHN, with the test errors of 3.77%, 19.73%, and 1.59%, respectively.

Methods: Porcine corneas were held in CS (4°C; 1-7 days) with Cornisol™ preservation medium supplemented with epothilone B (EpoB; microtubule stabilizer; 100 nM), SB-203580 (p38 mitogen-activated protein [MAP] kinase inhibitor; 20 μM), or antioxidants (quercetin, 100 μM; vitamin E, 1 mM; deferoxamine, an iron chelator, 10 mM). After CS termination, the damage to endothelial AJC was characterized by imaging perijunctional actomyosin ring (PAMR) and zonula occludens (ZO-1). The effects of EpoB and SB-203580 were characterized by imaging microtubules. The loss in the barrier function was assessed in cultured cells grown on biotin-coated gelatin by permeability to fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-avidin. The accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), altered mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), lipid peroxidation, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release were also determined in response to CS. Results: CS led to the loss of microtubules, destruction of PAMR, and breakdown of ZO-1 in the endothelium. The severity of damage increased when CS was prolonged. Although rewarming of the tissue increased the damage, the effect was marginal. CS also induced accumulation of ROS, alteration in MMP, lipid peroxidation, enhanced LDH release, and increased permeability to FITC-avidin. These changes were opposed by EpoB, SB-203580, and antioxidants. Conclusion: Corneal CS destroys AJC of the endothelium, leading to loss of its barrier function. The effects were surmounted by microtubule stabilization, p38 MAP kinase inhibition, and antioxidants. Thus, there is potential for reformulation of the preservation medium to maintain the health of the donor corneal endothelium before transplantation.",barrier dysfunction; cold storage; corneal endothelium; mitochondrial dysfunction; oxidative stress.

Unlike traditional dictionary-based algorithms, which typically learn a shared dictionary for all of the classes, we unify the intraclass and interclass mutual information (MI) into an single objective function to optimize class-specific dictionary. The objective function has two aims: 1) maximizing the MI between dictionary items within a specific class (intrinsic structure) and 2) minimizing the MI between the dictionary items in a given class and those of the other classes (extrinsic structure).

Comparison study of the proposed ischemic heart disease squirrel search optimization (IHDSSO) model in conjunction with random forest classifier ensures better feature selection and accuracy over 98% with respect to other state-of-the-art optimization algorithms.",Machine learning; feature selection; squirrel search algorithm; random forest algorithm; University of California Irvin dataset
997,Gangliosides in Neurodegenerative Diseases,"Robert Ledeen,Suman Chowdhury,Robert Ledeen,Suman Chowdhury","The main purpose of this chapter is to summarize the chief findings on ganglioside changes/interactions with some of the neurodegenerative disorders. For the latter we have focused on three diseases that have seen especially intensive study in that regard: Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, and Huntington's diseases. Parkinson's disease (PD) has received the most intensive study with revelation of systemic deficiency of GM1 in brain and all peripheral tissues that have been analyzed to date; this pointed to GM1 replacement as a promising therapy which proved only partially successful when tried for reasons that are discussed. Huntington's disease resembles PD in also manifesting GM1 deficiency, which did, however, respond to GM1 replacement therapy - apparently due to GM1 being administered directly into the brain. Alzheimer's disease was more complex in relation to gangliosides, with b-series (GD1b, GT1b) apparently depressed along with a-series. GM1 administered in brain appeared to induce improvement, but in a limited number of patients. We summarize studies showing why GM1 is of critical importance in neuronal function, and we also briefly point to a few additional neurological disorders in which one or more ganglioside changes have been implicated.",Alzheimer’s disease; GM1 essentiality; Gangliosides; Huntington’s disease; Neurodegenerative disorders; Parkinson’s disease.

While gene/protein expression profiling holds great potential as an approach to cancer diagnosis and prognosis, previously developed protocols using multiple diagnostic signatures for expression-based metastasis prediction have not been widely applied successfully because batch effects and different data types greatly decreased the predictive performance of gene/protein expression profile-based signatures in interlaboratory and data type dependent validation. To address this problem and assist in more precise diagnosis, we performed a genome-wide integrative proteome and transcriptome analysis and developed an ensemble machine learning-based integration algorithm for metastasis prediction (EMLI-Metastasis) and risk stratification (EMLI-Prognosis) in ICC. Based on massive proteome (216) and transcriptome (244) data sets, 132 feature (biomarker) genes were selected and used to train the EMLI-Metastasis algorithm. To accurately detect the metastasis of ICC patients, we developed a weighted ensemble machine learning method based on k-Top Scoring Pairs (k-TSP) method. This approach generates a metastasis classifier for each bootstrap aggregating training data set. Ten binary expression rank-based classifiers were generated for detection of metastasis separately. To further improve the accuracy of the method, the 10 binary metastasis classifiers were combined by weighted voting based on the score from the prediction results of each classifier. The prediction accuracy of the EMLI-Metastasis algorithm achieved 97.1% and 85.0% in proteome and transcriptome datasets, respectively. Among the 132 feature genes, 21 gene-pair signatures were developed to establish a metastasis-related prognosis risk-stratification model in ICC (EMLI-Prognosis). Based on EMLI-Prognosis algorithm, patients in the high-risk group had significantly dismal overall survival relative to the low-risk group in the clinical cohort (P-value < 0.05). Taken together, the EMLI-ICC algorithm provides a powerful and robust means for accurate metastasis prediction and risk stratification across proteome and transcriptome data types that is superior to currently used clinicopathological features in patients with ICC. Our developed algorithm could have profound implications not just in improved clinical care in cancer metastasis risk prediction, but also more broadly in machine-learning-based multi-cohort diagnosis method development. To make the EMLI-ICC algorithm easily accessible for clinical application, we established a web-based server for metastasis risk prediction (http://ibi.zju.edu.cn/EMLI/).",algorithm; intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC); machine learning; metastasis; risk stratification.
999,Domain Adaptation Meets Zero-Shot Learning: An Annotation-Efficient Approach to Multi-Modality Medical Image Segmentation,"Bian, Cheng; Yuan, Chenglang; Ma, Kai; Yu, Shuang; Wei, Dong; Zheng, Yefeng","Due to the lack of properly annotated medical data, exploring the generalization capability of the deep model is becoming a public concern. Zero-shot learning (ZSL) has emerged in recent years to equip the deep model with the ability to recognize unseen classes. However, existing studies mainly focus on natural images, which utilize linguistic models to extract auxiliary information for ZSL. It is impractical to apply the natural image ZSL solutions directly to medical images, since the medical terminology is very domain-specific, and it is not easy to acquire linguistic models for the medical terminology. In this work, we propose a new paradigm of ZSL specifically for medical images utilizing cross-modality information. We make three main contributions with the proposed paradigm. First, we extract the prior knowledge about the segmentation targets, called relation prototypes, from the prior model and then propose a cross-modality adaptation module to inherit the prototypes to the zero-shot model. Second, we propose a relation prototype awareness module to make the zero-shot model aware of information contained in the prototypes. Last but not least, we develop an inheritance attention module to recalibrate the relation prototypes to enhance the inheritance process. The proposed framework is evaluated on two public cross-modality datasets including a cardiac dataset and an abdominal dataset. Extensive experiments show that the proposed framework significantly outperforms the state of the arts.",Biomedical imaging; Image segmentation; Prototypes; Annotations; Data models; Semantics; Training; Zero-shot learning; semantic segmentation; multi-modality medical image

Research has shown that this function, when implemented in stochastic computing (SC) domain, can result in significant reduction in area cost and power consumption compared to its equivalent counterpart in the conventional binary-encoded (BE) deterministic computing. However, existing designs of SC inner product are disadvantaged due to high BE-SC conversion circuits, hence high overall area cost. They also suffer from correlation-induced errors that affect their accuracy performance. In this work, we propose a novel inner product design method for the SC domain that has high accuracy, low area cost, and most importantly, the circuit is correlation-insensitive. Experimental results show that the proposed design on average reduces 85.7% of hardware footprint when compared to its equivalent BE counterpart. We show that it outperforms current state-of-the-art SC designs in terms of area savings, both in computation and conversion costs. Furthermore, it achieves better (or comparable) accuracy performance compared to existing works, especially in designs having large number of inputs with low stochastic number lengths. Moreover, SC FIR filter based on the proposed design method outperforms state-of-the-art SC filters in terms of area and accuracy. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

1001,Industry-Fit AI Usage for Crack Detection in Ground Steel,"Soukup, Daniel; Kapeller, Christian; Raml, Bernhard; Ruisz, Johannes","We investigated optimal implementation strategies for industrial inspection systems aiming to detect cracks on ground steel billets' surfaces by combining state-of-the-art AI-based methods and classical computational imaging techniques. In 2D texture images, the interesting patterns of surface irregularities are often surrounded by visual clutter, which is to be ignored, e.g., grinding patterns. Even neural networks struggle to reliably distinguish between actual surface disruptions and irrelevant background patterns. Consequently, the image acquisition procedure already has to be optimised to the specific application. In our case, we use photometric stereo (PS) imaging to generate 3D surface models of steel billets using multiple illumination units. However, we demonstrate that the neural networks, especially in high-speed scenarios, still suffer from recognition deficiencies when using raw photometric stereo camera data, and are unable to generalise to new billets and image acquisition conditions. Only the additional application of adequate state-of-the-art image processing algorithms guarantees the best results in both aspects. The neural networks benefit when appropriate image acquisition methods together with image processing algorithms emphasise relevant surface structures and reduce overall pattern variation. Our proposed combined strategy shows a 9.25% better detection rate on validation data and is 14.7% better on test data, displaying the best generalisation.",deep learning; machine vision; computational imaging; photometric stereo; industrial quality inspection

To achieve the study's objectives, the fully modified least square (FMOLS), dynamic least squares (DOLS), canonical cointegrating regression (CCR), Bayer-Hanck cointegration and Toda-Yamamoto causality test are employed for the period 1984-2018. Results from the study show that coal mining contributes to environmental degradation in South Africa, while its interaction with institutional quality mitigates the severity of this negative impact. Furthermore, there is evidence that economic growth has a bidirectional causality with ecological footprint and coal mining, while institutional quality also Granger causes ecological footprint. To promote a sustainable environment, there is a need for the government and the institutions to form the foundation for the shift toward environmental sustainability, with particular attention paid to the development and implementation of greenhouse policy.",Causality; Coal mining; Cointegration; Ecological footprint; Environmental sustainability; Institutional quality.

However, the role of host-microbiota interactions in the host's response to rising temperature and the underlying mechanisms are incompletely understood in marine organisms. Here, the symbiotic intestinal microbiota and transcriptional responses between diploid and triploid oysters that displayed susceptible and resistant performance under the stress of rising temperature during a summer mortality event were compared to investigate the host-microbiota interactions. The rising and fluctuating temperatures triggered an earlier onset and higher mortality in susceptible oysters (46.7%) than in resistant oysters (17.3%). Correlation analysis between microbial properties and environmental factors showed temperature was strongly correlated with indices of α-diversity and the abundance of top 10 phyla, indicating that temperature significantly shaped the intestinal microbiota of oysters. The microbiota structure of resistant oysters exhibited more rapid changes in composition and diversity compared to susceptible oysters before peak mortality, indicating that resistant oysters possessed a stronger ability to regulate their symbiotic microbiota. Meanwhile, linear discriminant analysis effect size (LefSe) analysis found that the probiotics Verrucomicrobiales and Clostridiales were highly enriched in resistant oysters, and that potential pathogens Betaproteobacteriales and Acidobacteriales were enriched in susceptible oysters. These results implied that the symbiotic microbiota played a significant role in the oysters' adaptation to rising temperature. Accompanying the decrease in unfavorable bacteria before peak mortality, genes related to phagocytosis and lysozymes were upregulated and the xenobiotics elimination pathway was exclusively expressed in resistant oysters, demonstrating the validity of these immunological functions in controlling proliferation of pathogens driven by rising temperature. Compromised immunological functions might lead to proliferation of pathogens in susceptible oysters. This study might uncover a conserved mechanism of adaptation to rising temperature in marine invertebrates from the perspective of interactions between host and symbiotic microbiota.",Adaptation; Intestinal microbiota; Oyster mortality; Rising temperature; Transcriptomic response.

The great surface area and active groups within the GQDs permitted the functionalization with 8-HQ to increase their selectivity toward the analyte of interest. The fluorescence probe follows the Stern-Volmer model, yielding a direct relationship between the degree of quenching and the concentration of the analyte. Diverse parameters, including the pH and the use of masking agents, were optimized in order to improve the selectivity toward Hg2+ down to a limit of detection of 2.4 nmol L-1. It is hereby demonstrated that the functionalized GQDs work perfectly fine under adverse conditions such as acidic pH and in the presence of a large number of cationic and anionic interferences for the detection of Hg2+ in real samples. Parallel measurements using cold vapor atomic fluorescence spectrometry also demonstrated an excellent correlation with the front-face fluorescence method applied here for real samples including tap, river, underground, and dam waters.",Analytical method; Environmental samples; Fluorescent probe; Nanomaterial; Water analysis.

However, the performance of current state-of-the-art methods is limited, particularly when applied in highly reverberant room environments. In this paper, we propose a two-stage approach with two DNN-based methods to address this problem. In the first stage, the dereverheration of the speech mixture is achieved with the proposed dereverberation mask (DM). In the second stage, the dereverberant speech mixture is separated with the ideal ratio mask (IRM). To realize this two-stage approach, in the first DNN-based method, the DM is integrated with the IRM to generate the enhanced time-frequency (T-F) mask, namely the ideal enhanced mask (IEM), as the training target for the single DNN. In the second DNN-based method, the DM and the IRM are predicted with two individual DNNs. The IEEE and the TIMIT corpora with real room impulse responses and noise from the NOISEX dataset are used to generate speech mixtures for evaluations. The proposed methods outperform the state-of-the-art specifically in highly reverberant room environments.",Deep neural networks; monaural source separation; dereverheration mask; highly reverberant room environments

Compared with the static brain networks, the DFCNs have a natural advantage in reflecting the process of brain activity due to the time information contained in it. However, most of the current methods for constructing DFCNs fail to aggregate the brain topology structure and temporal variation of the functional architecture associated with brain regions, and often ignore the inherent multi-dimensional feature representation of DFCNs for classification. In order to address these issues, we propose a novel DFCNs construction and representation method and apply it to brain disease diagnosis. Specifically, we fuse the blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signal and interactions between brain regions to distinguish the brain topology within each time domain and across different time domains, by embedding block structure in the adjacency matrix. After that, a sparse tensor decomposition method with sparse local structure preserving regularization is developed to extract DFCNs features from a multi-dimensional perspective. Finally, the kernel discriminant analysis is employed to provide the decision result. We validate the proposed method on epilepsy and schizophrenia identification tasks, respectively. The experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms several state-of-the-art methods in the diagnosis of brain diseases.",Time-domain analysis; Feature extraction; Diseases; Epilepsy; Correlation; Tensors; Sparse matrices; Dynamic brain networks; tensor; rs-fMRI; computer-aided diagnosis
1008,Toward Modeling Psychomotor Performance in Karate Combats Using Computer Vision Pose Estimation,"Echeverria, Jon; Santos, Olga C.","Technological advances enable the design of systems that interact more closely with humans in a multitude of previously unsuspected fields. Martial arts are not outside the application of these techniques. From the point of view of the modeling of human movement in relation to the learning of complex motor skills, martial arts are of interest because they are articulated around a system of movements that are predefined, or at least, bounded, and governed by the laws of Physics. Their execution must be learned after continuous practice over time. Literature suggests that artificial intelligence algorithms, such as those used for computer vision, can model the movements performed. Thus, they can be compared with a good execution as well as analyze their temporal evolution during learning. We are exploring the application of this approach to model psychomotor performance in Karate combats (called kumites), which are characterized by the explosiveness of their movements. In addition, modeling psychomotor performance in a kumite requires the modeling of the joint interaction of two participants, while most current research efforts in human movement computing focus on the modeling of movements performed individually. Thus, in this work, we explore how to apply a pose estimation algorithm to extract the features of some predefined movements of Ippon Kihon kumite (a one-step conventional assault) and compare classification metrics with four data mining algorithms, obtaining high values with them.",human activity recognition (HAR); computer vision; deep learning; human pose estimation (HPE); OpenPose; martial arts; karate
1009,Learn to Threshold: ThresholdNet With Confidence-Guided Manifold Mixup for Polyp Segmentation,"Guo, Xiaoqing; Yang, Chen; Liu, Yajie; Yuan, Yixuan","The automatic segmentation of polyp in endoscopy images is crucial for early diagnosis and cure of colorectal cancer. Existing deep learning-based methods for polyp segmentation, however, are inadequate due to the limited annotated dataset and the class imbalance problems. Moreover, these methods obtained the final polyp segmentation results by simply thresholding the likelihood maps at an eclectic and equivalent value (often set to 0.5). In this paper, we propose a novel ThresholdNet with a confidence-guided manifold mixup (CGMMix) data augmentation method, mainly for addressing the aforementioned issues in polyp segmentation. The CGMMix conducts manifold mixup at the image and feature levels, and adaptively lures the decision boundary away from the under-represented polyp class with the confidence guidance to alleviate the limited training dataset and the class imbalance problems. Two consistency regularizations, mixup feature map consistency (MFMC) loss and mixup confidence map consistency (MCMC) loss, are devised to exploit the consistent constraints in the training of the augmented mixup data. We then propose a two-branch approach, termed ThresholdNet, to collaborate the segmentation and threshold learning in an alternative training strategy. The threshold map supervision generator (TMSG) is embedded to provide supervision for the threshold map, thereby inducing better optimization of the threshold branch. As a consequence, ThresholdNet is able to calibrate the segmentation result with the learned threshold map. We illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method on two polyp segmentation datasets, and our methods achieved the state-of-the-art result with 87.307% and 87.879% dice score on the EndoScene dataset and the WCE polyp dataset.

This system comprises 29 relative humidity (RH) and temperature sensors: 10 of them inserted into the plaster layer supporting the fresco paintings, 10 sensors in the walls close to the frescoes and nine sensors measuring the indoor microclimate at different points of the vault. Principal component analysis was applied to RH data recorded in 2007. The analysis was repeated with data collected in 2008 and 2010. The resulting loading plots revealed that the similarities and dissimilarities among sensors were approximately maintained along the three years. A physical interpretation was provided for the first and second principal components. Interestingly, sensors recording the highest RH values correspond to zones where humidity problems are causing formation of efflorescence. Recorded data of RH and temperature are discussed according to Italian Standard UNI 10829 (1999).",microclimate; art conservation; diagnosis; sensor; multivariate monitoring

Kamrul","Traffic sign detection is a central part of autonomous vehicle technology. Recent advances in deep learning algorithms have motivated researchers to use neural networks to perform this task. In this paper, we look at traffic sign detection as an image segmentation problem and propose a deep convolutional neural network-based approach to solve it. To this end, we propose a new network, the SegU-Net, which we form by merging the state-of-the-art segmentation architectures-SegNet and U-Net to detect traffic signs from video sequences. For training the network, we use the Tversky loss function constrained by an L1 term instead of the intersection over union loss traditionally used to train segmentation networks. We use a separate network, inspired by the VGG-16 architecture, to classify the detected signs. The networks are trained on the challenge free sequences of the CURE-TSD dataset. Our proposed network outperforms the state-of-the-art object detection networks, such as the Faster R-CNN inception Resnet V2 and R-FCN Resnet 101, by a large margin and obtains a precision and recall of 94.60% and 80.21%, respectively, which is the current state of the art on this part of the dataset. In addition, the network is tested on the German Traffic Sign Detection Benchmark (GTSDB) dataset, where it achieves a precision and recall of 95.29% and 89.01%, respectively. This is on a par with the performance of the aforementioned object detection networks.

The appearance of high anatomical diversity in hominin groups coincides with long-lasting and relatively stable humid conditions from ~620,000 to 275,000 years bp (episodes 1-6), interrupted by several abrupt and extreme hydroclimate perturbations. A pattern of pronounced climatic cyclicity transformed habitats during episodes 7-9 (~275,000-60,000 years bp), a crucial phase encompassing the gradual transition from Acheulean to Middle Stone Age technologies, the emergence of Homo sapiens in eastern Africa and key human social and cultural innovations.

Furthermore, the binary and ternary nanocomposites of graphitic carbon nitride further enhance their performance as a sensor making it a cost effective, fast, and reliable gadget for the purpose, and opens a wide area of research.

As few studies have been published specific to clinician evaluation and management of this population, this analysis serves to begin to identify educational needs and potential clinical impact.Methods: We conducted a case-based survey of US general pediatric (n = 227), allergy (n = 158), and pediatric pulmonology (n = 70) clinicians to understand the current approach to management of pediatric patients with moderate-to-severe asthma.Results: Results show inconsistencies in guideline adherence, identification of disease severity and control, referral practices, and knowledge of phenotypes, which may impact clinical decision making. While most clinicians refer to guidelines when managing pediatric patients with moderate-to-severe asthma, there is no preferred set, and they find the guidelines to be moderately useful. General pediatricians are more likely than specialists to have difficulty distinguishing control and severity and may not be familiar with the concept of asthma phenotype. Most surveyed pediatricians indicated they refer patients to a specialist, but did not always do so in the cases. Clinicians have little consensus on the best approach to manage patients with uncontrolled symptoms after optimized therapy. Many clinicians may have uncertainty about how elevated eosinophils or FeNO could affect patient management. Further, there may be gaps in incorporating parents and pediatric patients into shared decision-making in their care.Conclusions: Understanding the needs of those managing patients with moderate-to-severe asthma is critical to developing effective continuing education activities to improve patient outcomes.",Education; management/control; pediatrics; phenotypes; treatment.

When constructing large-scale parallel computing systems, they will face many challenges in system efficiency, power consumption, system maintenance, and cost. Heterogeneous architectures have begun to become the key to constructing supercomputer systems. In order to improve the optimization efficiency of the particle swarm algorithm, based on the simplified particle swarm algorithm, an improved strategy for fusion of population information is proposed. Only using the optimal position of the individual particle and the optimal position of the population to update the particle position makes the algorithm description simpler, construct a random term that depends on the population information to increase the diversity of the population, and design an adaptive control function equation to balance the algorithm's global detection and local detection. This article aims to study the design and algorithm of art installations for heterogeneous computing architecture and particle swarm algorithm. Aiming at the two heterogeneous system components of GPU and FPGA in heterogeneous computing systems to solve the dual heterogeneous problem between various computing components and applications, a task flow model for heterogeneous computing systems is proposed, which adopts heterogeneous systems. The structure focuses on the deterministic and nondeterministic calculation methods of particle swarm algorithm and carries out parallel research algorithms of particle transport data to analyze the design of art installations. The experimental results show that by making full use of the GPU hardware storage structure to improve memory access speed and reduce cache failure, the combination of particle swarm algorithm and heterogeneous computing system enables the calculation of the carrier components to obtain 3 times the acceleration effect; through the energy analysis model, Heterogeneous computing system components can obtain at least 1.5 times performance improvement.",Computer architecture; Computational modeling; Heterogeneous networks; Particle swarm optimization; Statistics; Sociology; Optimization
1019,Keypoint detection by wave propagation,"Salti, Samuele; Lanza, Alessandro; Di Stefano, Luigi","We propose to rely on the wave equation for the detection of repeatable keypoints invariant up to image scale and rotation and robust to viewpoint variations, blur, and lighting changes. The algorithm exploits the properties of local spatial-temporal extrema of the evolution of image intensities under the wave propagation to highlight salient symmetries at different scales. Although the image structures found by most state-of-the-art detectors, such as blobs and corners, occur typically on highly textured surfaces, salient symmetries are widespread in diverse kinds of images, including those related to poorly textured objects, which are hardly dealt with by current pipelines based on local invariant features. The impact on the overall algorithm of different numerical wave simulation schemes and their parameters is discussed, and a pyramidal approximation to speed-up the simulation is proposed and validated. Experiments on publicly available datasets show that the proposed algorithm offers state-of-the-art repeatability on a broad set of different images while detecting regions that can be distinctively described and robustly matched.

1020,Efficient Noisy Sound-Event Mixture Classification Using Adaptive-Sparse Complex-Valued Matrix Factorization and OvsO SVM,"Parathai, Phetcharat; Tengtrairat, Naruephorn; Woo, Wai Lok; Abdullah, Mohammed A. M.; Rafiee, Gholamreza; Alshabrawy, Ossama","This paper proposes a solution for events classification from a sole noisy mixture that consist of two major steps: a sound-event separation and a sound-event classification. The traditional complex nonnegative matrix factorization (CMF) is extended by cooperation with the optimal adaptiveL(1)sparsity to decompose a noisy single-channel mixture. The proposed adaptiveL(1)sparsity CMF algorithm encodes the spectra pattern and estimates the phase of the original signals in time-frequency representation. Their features enhance the temporal decomposition process efficiently. The support vector machine (SVM) based one versus one (OvsO) strategy was applied with a mean supervector to categorize the demixed sound into the matching sound-event class. The first step of the multi-class MSVM method is to segment the separated signal into blocks by sliding demixed signals, then encoding the three features of each block. Mel frequency cepstral coefficients, short-time energy, and short-time zero-crossing rate are learned with multi sound-event classes by the SVM based OvsO method. The mean supervector is encoded from the obtained features. The proposed method has been evaluated with both separation and classification scenarios using real-world single recorded signals and compared with the state-of-the-art separation method. Experimental results confirmed that the proposed method outperformed the state-of-the-art methods.",audio signal processing; sound event classification; nonnegative matric factorization; blind signal separation; support vector machines

J.; Wang, Guanghui; You, Xinge","Traffic surveillance is an important topic in computer vision and intelligent transportation systems and has intensively been studied in the past decades. However, most of the state-of-the-art methods concentrate on daytime traffic monitoring. In this paper, we propose a nighttime traffic surveillance system, which consists of headlight detection, headlight tracking and pairing, and camera calibration and vehicle speed estimation. First, a vehicle headlight is detected using a reflection intensity map and a reflection suppressed map based on the analysis of the light attenuation model. Second, the headlight is tracked and paired by utilizing a simple yet effective bidirectional reasoning algorithm. Finally, the trajectories of the vehicle's headlight are employed to calibrate the surveillance camera and estimate the vehicle's speed. Experimental results on typical sequences show that the proposed method can robustly detect, track, and pair the vehicle headlight in night scenes. Extensive quantitative evaluations and related comparisons demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods.",Calibration; intelligent transportation system; reflection; vehicle headlight detection; vehicle headlight pairing
1022,Monoclonal antibodies targeting small airways: a new perspective for biological therapies in severe asthma,"Carlo Lombardi,Marcello Cottini,Alvise Berti,Pasquale Comberiati,Carlo Lombardi,Marcello Cottini,Alvise Berti,Pasquale Comberiati","Small airway dysfunction (SAD) in asthma is characterized by the inflammation and narrowing of airways with less of 2 mm in diameter between generations 8 and 23 of the bronchial tree. It is now widely accepted that small airways are involved in the pathogenesis of asthma and are a major determinant of airflow obstruction in this disease. In recent years, specialized tests have been developed, such as Impulse Oscillometry (IOS) and Multiple Breath Nitrogen Washout (MBNW) tests, which have been deemed more accurate in detecting SAD than conventional spirometry. Clinical studies show that SAD is associated with more severe bronchial hyperresponsiveness, worse asthma control, and a higher risk of exacerbations. Recent data from a large cohort study showed that the prevalence of SAD in asthma patients increases with asthma severity. Overall, SAD seems to represent a treatable trait, which makes it appealing for asthma control optimization and exacerbation rate reduction, especially in moderate-to-severe asthma.Biologic agents are now available for the treatment of different severe asthma phenotypes and endotypes. However, the effect of these therapies on SAD remains poorly characterized. Literature showing that biologic agents can also favorably improve small airway function is accumulating. In particular, anti-IL5 agents (mepolizumab and benralizumab) seems to have a greater impact on SAD as compared to other biological agents, but direct comparisons in prospective randomized controlled trials are lacking.In this mini-review article, we address the latest evidence on the effect of biological therapies on SAD in patients with severe asthma.",Benralizumab; Biological agents; Dupilumab; Mepolizumab; Omalizumab; Severe asthma; Small airways disease; Tezepelumab.

Uncommon SARS-CoV-2 point mutations could cause nucleocapsid (N) gene target failure (NGTF) when using first-generation Xpert Xpress assays, so improvements were designed and implemented. In response to NGTF reports and with consideration of viral genomic information in public databases, the Xpress assays were redesigned to mitigate the impact of SARS-CoV-2 mutations on qualitative assay performance. The second-generation assays include a third gene target (RNA-dependent RNA polymerase [RdRp]) and redundant oligonucleotide probes for the N2 target. First- and second-generation assay performances were evaluated using a challenge set of samples. A second-generation assay with updated oligonucleotide chemistry received FDA EUA in September 2021. A prototype assay with oligonucleotide chemistry similar to that of the second-generation assay with FDA EUA successfully detected all three gene targets (N2, envelope [E], and RdRp) in all challenge samples (100%; 50/50), including variants with N gene mutations (g.29197C>T or g.29200C>T), which caused NGTF in the first-generation assays. Investigation and reporting of IVD target failures, public sharing of viral genomic sequence data, and the FDA EUA pathway were essential components in facilitating a short cycle time from the identification of mutations that impact the performance of an IVD assay to the design and implementation of an improved IVD assay. IMPORTANCE The SARS-CoV-2 genome has mutated during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Some of these mutations have impacted the performance of nucleic acid amplification tests like PCR, which are commonly used as diagnostic tools to detect an infection. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) emergency use authorization (EUA) process enables the rapid reformulation and regulatory authorization of improved PCRs. In our experience, the identification of SARS-CoV-2 mutations that impact PCR performance, the subsequent development of improved PCR chemistry, and the use of the FDA EUA regulatory pathway led to improved diagnostic performance during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic that is able to keep pace with the rapidly evolving genome of SARS-CoV-2.",Cepheid; FDA emergency use authorization; NGTF; SARS-CoV-2; Xpert; Xpress; gene mutations; target failures.

In this context, several metaheuristic techniques have been extensively studied achieving results comparable to some state-of-the-art and traditional optimization techniques. This paper introduces a variation of the Brain Storm Optimization (i.e., Binary Brain Storm Optimization) for feature selection purposes, where real-valued solutions are mapped onto a boolean hyper cube using different transfer functions. The proposed Binary Brain Storm Optimization was evaluated under different scenarios and with its results compared to some state-of-the-art techniques.

1025,Sinkhorn Adversarial Attack and Defense,"Subramanyam, A. V.","Adversarial attacks have been extensively investigated in the recent past. Quite interestingly, a majority of these attacks primarily work in the l(p) space. In this work, we propose a novel approach for generating adversarial samples using Wasserstein distance. Unlike previous approaches, we use an unbalanced optimal transport formulation which is naturally suited for images. We first compute an adversarial sample using a gradient step and then project the resultant image into Wasserstein ball with respect to original sample. The attack introduces perturbation in the form of pixel mass distribution which is guided by a cost metric. Elaborate experiments on MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10 and Tiny ImageNet demonstrate a sharp decrease in the performance of state-of-art classifiers. We also perform experiments with adversarially trained classifiers and show that our system achieves superior performance in terms of adversarial defense against several state-of-art attacks.

In recent years, machines have managed to master the art of generating speech that is understandable by humans. However, the linguistic content of an utterance encompasses only a part of its meaning. Affect, or expressivity, has the capacity to turn speech into a medium capable of conveying intimate thoughts, feelings, and emotions-aspects that are essential for engaging and naturalistic interpersonal communication. While the goal of imparting expressivity to synthesized utterances has so far remained elusive, following recent advances in text-to-speech synthesis, a paradigm shift is well under way in the fields of affective speech synthesis and conversion as well. Deep learning, as the technology that underlies most of the recent advances in artificial intelligence, is spearheading these efforts.

1027,Measurement approaches for Thermal Impedance Spectroscopy of Li-ion batteries,"Kirst, Cedric; Zayas, Juan Ramos; Singer, Jan","This work introduces two novel measurement methods for capturing the thermal behaviour of Li-ion cells in the frequency domain. For the validation, we compare them to the state of the art measurement method, in which the battery is thermally stimulated by a set of discrete frequencies, each tested individually in a sequential manner. All experiments are conducted with a cylindrical 18650 LFP-Graphite cell and lead to similar thermal impedance spectra. We validate a 0-D thermal model fitted to the respective measurement results with a thermal step response in the time domain. The results show, that all three models accurately represent the thermal behaviour of a Li-ion cell, with a mean absolute error below 0.3 K on the validation test. A spider-web diagram classifies and compares the given methods based on five values showing, that the state of art thermal measurement time can be reduced by 62% while also increasing the impedance measurement resolution by measuring multiple frequencies simultaneously.",Thermal model; Thermal Impedance Spectroscopy; Li-ion cells

We analyzed observational studies on patients with AMI and CS, identified through a systematic search using PubMed and Scopus databases. The main outcome was mortality and other outcomes of interest were risk of major bleeding, re-infarction, cerebrovascular adverse events, and need for revascularization. We conducted the meta-analysis with data from 15 studies. Compared to patients without diabetes, those with diabetes had an increased risk of in-hospital mortality (OR, 1.34; 95% CI, 1.17-1.54) and cerebrovascular complications (OR, 1.28; 95% CI, 1.11-1.48).

In addition, it is a highly unregulated market, with very little standardized information in economic terms. This paper focuses on art galleries, which are the most influential intermediaries in the Spanish primary contemporary fine-art market and perform a role that goes beyond the mere distribution of works of art. This study develops and applies a prospective methodology based on the subjective information compiled by experts, known as the Delphi method, to identify and evaluate the factors that determine the current situation and future outlook for Spanish contemporary art galleries. The results show, on one hand, that the method employed constitutes a valid option to provide reliable information. In addition, they show that the survival of these organizations will depend on their ability to adapt to the changing conditions of the economic environment, reactivating and internationalizing demand, and redirecting their business model towards sustainable management by implementing appropriate business management models and techniques.",contemporary art market; art galleries; sustainable management; Delphi method; foresight study
1031,Establishment and Evaluation of a New Meteorological Observation-Based Grid Model for Estimating Zenith Wet Delay in Ground-Based Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS),"Yao, Yibin; Sun, Zhangyu; Xu, Chaoqian","With the availability to high-accuracy a priori zenith wet delay (ZWD) data, the positioning efficiency of the precise point positioning (PPP) processing can be effectively improved, including accelerating the convergence time and improving the positioning precision, in ground-based Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) technology. Considering the limitations existing in the state-of-the-art ZWD models, this paper established and evaluated a new in-situ meteorological observation-based grid model for estimating ZWD named GridZWD using the radiosonde data and the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECWMF) data. The results show that ZWD has a strong correlation with the meteorological parameter water vapor pressure in continental and high-latitude regions. The root of mean square error (RMS) of 24.6 mm and 36.0 mm are achievable by the GridZWD model when evaluated with the ECWMF data and the radiosonde data, respectively.

The defects in PCC reduce the concentrations of nonesterified coenzyme A (CoASH), thus compromising mitochondrial function and disrupting intermediary metabolism. Here, we use a hypomorphic PA mouse model to test the effectiveness of BBP-671 in correcting the metabolic imbalances in PA. BBP-671 is a high-affinity allosteric pantothenate kinase activator that counteracts feedback inhibition of the enzyme to increase the intracellular concentration of CoA. Liver CoASH and acetyl-CoA are depressed in PA mice and BBP-671 treatment normalizes the cellular concentrations of these two key cofactors. Hepatic propionyl-CoA is also reduced by BBP-671 leading to an improved intracellular C3:C2-CoA ratio. Elevated plasma C3:C2-carnitine ratio and methylcitrate, hallmark biomarkers of PA, are significantly reduced by BBP-671. The large elevations of malate and α-ketoglutarate in the urine of PA mice are biomarkers for compromised tricarboxylic acid cycle activity and BBP-671 therapy reduces the amounts of both metabolites. Furthermore, the low survival of PA mice is restored to normal by BBP-671. These data show that BBP-671 relieves CoA sequestration, improves mitochondrial function, reduces plasma PA biomarkers, and extends the lifespan of PA mice, providing the preclinical foundation for the therapeutic potential of BBP-671.",Coenzyme A; metabolomics; mitochondria; propionic acidemia; propionyl-CoA carboxylase; tricarboxcylic acid cycle.

The causes include anemia of chronic disease, vitamin B12 and iron deficiency, opportunistic infections (Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Pneumocystis jiroveci), HIV-related bone marrow suppression, AIDS-associated malignancies, and antiretroviral therapy (ART), specifically zidovudine. In HIV patients with advanced immunodeficiency, failure to produce neutralizing antibodies can lead to chronic parvovirus B19 (B19) infection. Normally, in persons with intact immunity, the progression of B19 is self-limited. However, in chronic B19 infection, it can lead to pure red cell aplasia (PRCA) and chronic anemia. In human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients, B19-related anemia is rare and underdiagnosed. It has a great response to intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) therapy. Hence, early diagnosis and prompt treatment can significantly reduce mortality. In this article, we described the case of a 25-year-old male with HIV infection who presented with a headache. He had severe normocytic anemia with a low reticulocyte count. The workup for blood loss, hemolysis, hemoglobinopathy, and iron deficiency was negative. Because of extremely low reticulocytopenia with severe anemia, the investigations favored multiple myeloma, parvovirus infection, and bone marrow aspiration biopsy. He was tested for parvovirus B19 deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test due to insufficient seroconversion. It turned out to be positive and he was treated with IVIG therapy.",hiv infection; immunocompromised; parvovirus b19; pure red cell aplasia; severe anemia.

Nevertheless, so far the focus has been on the selective response triggered by a single stressor. Building on the highly parallel selection response of founder populations with reduced variation, we evaluated how the presence of a second stressor affects the genomic selection response. After 20 generations of adaptation to laboratory conditions at either 18°C or 29°C, strong genome-wide selection signatures were observed. Only 38% of the selection signatures can be attributed to laboratory adaptation (no difference between temperature regimes). The remaining selection responses are either caused by temperature-specific effects, or reflect the joint effects of temperature and laboratory adaptation (same direction, but the magnitude differs between temperatures). The allele frequency changes resulting from the combined effects of temperature and laboratory adaptation were more extreme in the hot environment for 83% of the affected genomic regions-indicating widespread synergistic effects of the two stressors. We conclude that E&R with reduced genetic variation is a powerful approach to study genome-wide fitness consequences driven by the combined effects of multiple environmental factors.",Drosophila melanogaster; experimental evolution; local adaptation; parallel evolution; temperature adaptation.

Kevin","There is clinical evidence that suppressing the bone structures in Chest X-rays (CXRs) improves diagnostic value, either for radiologists or computer-aided diagnosis. However, bone-free CXRs are not always accessible. We hereby propose a coarse-to-fine CXR bone suppression approach by using structural priors derived from unpaired computed tomography (CT) images. In the low-resolution stage, we use the digitally reconstructed radiograph (DRR) image that is computed from CT as a bridge to connect CT and CXR. We then perform CXR bone decomposition by leveraging the DRR bone decomposition model learned from unpaired CTs and domain adaptation between CXR and DRR. To further mitigate the domain differences between CXRs and DRRs and speed up the learning convergence, we perform all the aboved operations in Laplacian of Gaussian (LoG) domain. After obtaining the bone decomposition result in DRR, we upsample it to a high resolution, based on which the bone region in the original high-resolution CXR is cropped and processed to produce a high-resolution bone decomposition result. Finally, such a produced bone image is subtracted from the original high-resolution CXR to obtain the bone suppression result. We conduct experiments and clinical evaluations based on two benchmarking CXR databases to show that (i) the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art unsupervised CXR bone suppression approaches; (ii) the CXRs with bone suppression are instrumental to radiologists for reducing their false-negative rate of lung diseases from 15% to 8%; and (iii) state-of-the-art disease classification performances are achieved by learning a deep network that takes the original CXR and its bone-suppressed image as inputs.",Bones; Computed tomography; Computational modeling; Image resolution; Manuals; Computational efficiency; Generative adversarial networks; Coarse-to-fine; CXR bone suppression; domain adaptation; LoG transform; unsupervised leaning

The slice-level motion is estimated through a filtering approach that allows tracking the head motion during the scan and correcting for out-of-plane inconsistency in the acquired images. Diffusion-sensitized image slices are registered to a base volume sequentially over time in the acquisition order where an outlier-robust Kalman filter, coupled with slice-to-volume registration, estimates head motion parameters. Diffusion gradient directions are corrected for the aligned DWI slices based on the computed rotation parameters and the diffusion tensors are directly estimated from the corrected data at each voxel using weighted linear least squares. The method was evaluated in DWI scans of adult volunteers who deliberately moved during scans as well as clinical DWI of 28 neonates and children with different types of motion. Experimental results showed marked improvements in DWI reconstruction using the proposed method compared to the state-of-the-art DWI analysis based on volume-to-volume registration.

Live animal models have associated ethical issues and scientific concerns regarding the predictability of human responses. Alternative models that replicate the 3D architecture of the central nervous system have prompted the development of organotypic neural injury models. However, the lack of reliable means to access normal human neural tissue has driven reliance on pathological or post-mortem tissue which limits their biological utility. We have established a protocol to use donor cerebellar tonsillar tissue surgically resected from patients with Chiari malformation (cerebellar herniation towards the foramen magnum, with ectopic rather than diseased tissue) to develop an in vitro organotypic model of traumatic brain injury. Viable tissue was maintained for approximately 2 weeks with all the major neural cell types detected. Traumatic injuries could be introduced into the slices with some cardinal features of post-injury pathology evident. Biomaterial placement was also feasible within the in vitro lesions. Accordingly, this 'proof-of-concept' study demonstrates that the model offers potential as an alternative to the use of animal tissue for preclinical testing in neural tissue engineering. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration that donor tissue from patients with Chiari malformation can be used to develop a benchtop model of traumatic brain injury. However, significant challenges in relation to the clinical availability of tissue were encountered, and we discuss logistical issues that must be considered for model scale-up.",Chiari malformation; biomaterial; cerebellar slice; human tissue; injury model; neuroregeneration; organotypic; traumatic brain injury.
1039,Multiple genetic sources facilitate the northward range expansion of an intertidal oyster along China's coast,"Li-Sha Hu,Yun-Wei Dong,Li-Sha Hu,Yun-Wei Dong","Coastal artificial structures on the former mudflats provide available habitats for the rocky intertidal species which can establish new populations in these emerging habitats over their former distribution range limits. As a former southern species, the oyster Crassostrea sikamea has become a pioneer and rapidly invaded the artificial shorelines in northern China. We used a seascape genomics approach to investigate the population structure and genetic sources of C. sikamea on the coastal artificial structures, which is crucial for understanding the genetic mechanisms driving species distribution range expansion and invasion pathway of intertidal species. Five C. sikamea populations, including two artificial substrate populations (WGZ and ZAP), one oyster reef population (LS), and two natural rocky shore populations (ZS and XM), were measured using single nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs) obtained from double digest restriction-site associated DNA sequencing (ddRAD-Seq). Redundancy analyses (RDA) were implemented for investigating the relationship between local temperature variables and the temperature adaptability of C. sikamea. Genetic diversity, direction and strength of gene flow, and population structure all revealed that the LS and ZS populations were the genetic sources for the oyster populations on the emerging northern coastal artificial structures. Results of RDA showed that there were different adaptive potentials for northern and southern populations to local temperature variables and the oyster reef population which frequently suffers from heat stress owned high heat adaptability. The ZS population as a genetic source nearby the Yangtze River estuary provided mass larvae for the northern populations, and the other genetic source, the heat-tolerant LS population, in the oyster reef played an important role in the post-settlement success by providing preadapted genotypes. These results highlight the importance of multiple sources with divergent adaptative capabilities for biological invasion, and also emphasize the importance of the oyster reef in coastal biodiversity and conservation.",adaptation; biogeographic barrier; biological invasion; dispersal pathway; genetic sources; population connectivity.

To investigate the pathophysiology of HANAC syndrome, we generated mice harboring the Col4a1 p.Gly498Val mutation identified in a family with the syndrome. Col4a1 G498V mutation resulted in delayed glomerulogenesis and podocyte differentiation without reduction of nephron number, causing albuminuria and hematuria in newborns.

Abnormal structure of Bowman's capsule was associated with metalloproteinase induction and activation of the glomerular parietal epithelial cells that abnormally expressed CD44,α-SMA, ILK, and DDR1. Inflammatory infiltrates were observed around glomeruli and arterioles. Homozygous Col4a1 G498V mutant mice additionally showed dysmorphic papillae and urinary concentration defects. These results reveal a developmental role for the α1α1α2 collagen IV molecule in the embryonic glomerular basement membrane, affecting podocyte differentiation. The observed association between molecular alteration of the collagenous network in Bowman's capsule of the mature kidney and activation of parietal epithelial cells, matrix remodeling, and inflammation may account for glomerular cyst development and CKD in patients with COL4A1-related disorders.",genetic renal disease; glomerular epithelial cells; kidney development; molecular biology.
1041,"Survey on Wheel Slip Control Design Strategies, Evaluation and Application to Antilock Braking Systems","Pretagostini, Francesco; Ferranti, Laura; Berardo, Giovanni; Ivanov, Valentin; Shyrokau, Barys","Since their introduction, anti-lock braking systems (ABS) have mostly relied on heuristic, rule-based control strategies. ABS performance, however, can be significantly improved thanks to many recent technological developments. This work presents an extensive review of the state of the art to verify such a statement and quantify the benefits of a new generation of wheel slip control (WSC) systems. Motivated by the state of the art, as a case study, a nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) design based on a new load-sensing technology was developed. The proposed ABS was tested on Toyota's high-end vehicle simulator and was benchmarked against currently applied industrial controller. Additionally, a comprehensive set of manoeuvres were deployed to assess the performance and robustness of the proposed NMPC design. The analysis showed substantial reduction of the braking distance and better steerability with the proposed approach. Furthermore, the proposed design showed comparable robustness against external factors to the industrial benchmark.",Road vehicles; vehicle safety; antilock braking system; wheel slip control; model predictive control
1042,Maximum Power Peak Detection of Partially Shaded PV Panel by Using Intelligent Monkey King Evolution Algorithm,"Kumar, Nishant; Hussain, Ikhlaq; Singh, Bhim; Panigrahi, Bijaya Ketan","This work deals with the development of an intelligent monkey king evolution (IMKE) algorithm for maximum power peak (MPP) detection under partially shaded condition in a solar photovoltaic (SPV) array. In IMKE algorithm, an additional intelligent decision taking ability is embedded with the monkey king evolution (MKE) algorithm, which magnifies all the options to closely observe the exact peak position. The MKE algorithm is good in terms of exploration and exploitation. However, the additional intelligent decision taking ability avoids the stagnation on local maxima and helps to quickly track the true global maximum position. The performance evaluation of IMKE algorithm is performed on ten types of power-voltage patterns of partially shaded SPV array, through MATLAB simulation, as well as through experimentation. Moreover, the effectiveness of all the results is verified through comparison with state-of-the-art methods. The satisfactory steady-state and dynamic performances of the IMKE algorithm on partially shaded SPV array show the superiority over the state-of-the-art maximum power point tracking methods.",Intelligent monkey king evolution (IMKE); maximum power point tracking (MPPT); partially shaded condition (PSC); solar photovoltaic (SPV)
1043,"TMO-Net: A Parameter-Free Tone Mapping Operator Using Generative Adversarial Network, and Performance Benchmarking on Large Scale HDR Dataset","Panetta, Karen; Kezebou, Landry; Oludare, Victor; Agaian, Sos; Xia, Zehua","Currently published tone mapping operators (TMO) are often evaluated on a very limited test set of high dynamic range (HDR) images. Thus, the resulting performance index is highly subject to extensive hyperparameter tuning, and many TMOs exhibit sub-optimal performance when tested on a broader spectrum of HDR images. This indicates that there are deficiencies in the generalizable applicability of these techniques. Finally, it is a challenge developing parameter-free tone mapping operators using data-hungry advanced deep learning methods due to the paucity of large scale HDR datasets. In this paper, these issues are addressed through the following contributions: a) a large scale HDR image benchmark dataset (LVZ-HDR dataset) with multiple variations in sceneries and lighting conditions is created to enable performance evaluation of TMOs across a diverse conditions and scenes that will also contribute to facilitate the development of more robust TMOs using state-of-the-art deep learning methods; b) a deep learning-based tone mapping operator (TMO-Net) is presented, which offers an efficient and parameter-free method capable of generalizing effectively across a wider spectrum of HDR content; c) finally, a comparative analysis, and performance benchmarking of 19 state-of-the-art TMOs on the new LVZ-HDR dataset are presented. Standard metrics including the Tone Mapping Quality Index (TMQI), Feature Similarity Index for Tone Mapped images (FSITM), and Natural Image Quality Evaluator (NIQE) are used to qualitatively evaluate the performance index of the benchmarked TMOs. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed TMO-Net qualitatively and quantitatively outperforms current state-of-the-art TMOs.",Dynamic range; Benchmark testing; Deep learning; Visualization; Generative adversarial networks; Image segmentation; Licenses; Deep learning; GAN-based tone mapping; TMO benchmarking; tone mapping; TMO-Net HDR dataset; parameter-free tone mapping

1045,KDFC-ART: a KD-tree approach to enhancing Fixed-size-Candidate-set Adaptive Random Testing,"Mao, Chengying; Zhan, Xuzheng; Tse, T. H.; Chen, Tsong Yueh","Adaptive random testing (ART) was developed as an enhanced version of random testing to increase the effectiveness of detecting failures in programs by spreading the test cases evenly over the input space. However, heavy computation may be incurred. In this paper, three enhanced algorithms for fixed-size-candidate-set ART (FSCS-ART) are proposed based on the $k$-dimensional tree (KD-tree) structure. The first algorithm Naive-KDFC constructs a KD-tree by splitting the input space with respect to every dimension successively in a round-robin fashion. The second algorithm SemiBal-KDFC improves the balance of the KD-tree by prioritizing the splitting according to the spread in each dimension. In order to control the number of traversed nodes in backtracking, the third algorithm LimBal-KDFC introduces an upper bound for the nodes involved. Simulation and empirical studies have been conducted to investigate the efficiency and effectiveness of the three algorithms. The experimental results show that these algorithms significantly reduce the computation time of the original FSCS-ART for low dimensions and for the case of high dimensions with low failure rates. The efficiency of SemiBal-KDFC is better than that of Naive-KDFC when the dimension is no more than 8, but LimBal-KDFC is the most efficient of all three. Although the limited backtracking leads only to an approximate nearest neighbor in LimBal-KDFC, its failure-detection effectiveness is, in fact, better than FSCS-ART in high-dimensional input spaces and has no significant deterioration in low-dimensional spaces.",Power capacitors; Testing; Subspace constraints; Software; Strips; Data structures; Aerospace electronics; Adaptive random testing (ART); computation time; effectiveness; efficiency; KD-tree; software testing; test case generation

In times of rapidly advancing precision oncology approaches in everyday clinical processes, reliable and valid tumor models are required. Tumor organoids consist of tumor ""stem"" cells, differentiated (epithelial) tumor, and stroma cells. The cellular architecture and interactions closely mimic the original patient tumor. These organoids can be implanted into immunodeficient mice, generating patient-derived organoid-derived xenografts, thus enabling in vitro to in vivo transfer. Most importantly, the high clinical relevance of PDO models is maintained in this conversion. This protocol describes in detail the methods and techniques as well as the materials necessary to generate in vitro PDO and in vivo PDO-derived xenograft models. The elaborate process description starts with the processing of freshly obtained tumor tissue. The proceedings include tissue processing, organoid culturing, PDO implantation into immunodeficient mice, tumor explantation, and finally tumor preservation. All these proceedings are described in this timely chronological order. This protocol will enable researchers to generate PDO models from freshly received tumor tissue and generate PDO-derived xenografts.

Slim model can be achieved by minimizing computational complexity which theoretically will make processing time faster. Therefore, our focus is to build an architecture with minimum floating-point operation per second (FLOPs). In this work, we propose a small and slim architecture which later will be compared to state-of-the-art models. This architecture will be implemented into two models which are CustomNet and CustomNet2. Each of these models implements 3 convolutional blocks which reduce the computational complexity while maintains its accuracy and able to compete with state-of-the-art DCNN models. These models will be trained using ImageNet, CIFAR 10, CIFAR 100 and other datasets. The result will be compared based on accuracy, complexity, size, processing time, and trainable parameter. From the result, we found that one of our models which is CustomNet2, is better than MobileNet, MobileNet-v2, DenseNet, NASNetMobile in accuracy, trainable parameter, and complexity.

1048,Inflammation and plaque vulnerability,"G K Hansson,P Libby,I Tabas,G K Hansson,P Libby,I Tabas","Atherosclerosis is a maladaptive, nonresolving chronic inflammatory disease that occurs at sites of blood flow disturbance. The disease usually remains silent until a breakdown of integrity at the arterial surface triggers the formation of a thrombus. By occluding the lumen, the thrombus or emboli detaching from it elicits ischaemic symptoms that may be life-threatening. Two types of surface damage can cause atherothrombosis: plaque rupture and endothelial erosion. Plaque rupture is thought to be caused by loss of mechanical stability, often due to reduced tensile strength of the collagen cap surrounding the plaque. Therefore, plaques with reduced collagen content are thought to be more vulnerable than those with a thick collagen cap. Endothelial erosion, on the other hand, may occur after injurious insults to the endothelium instigated by metabolic disturbance or immune insults. This review discusses the molecular mechanisms involved in plaque vulnerability and the development of atherothrombosis.",atherosclerosis; atherothrombosis; en-dothelial erosion; inflammation; plaque rupture.
1049,Thyroid disorders and gastrointestinal and liver dysfunction: A state of the art review,"Angelos Kyriacou,John McLaughlin,Akheel A Syed,Angelos Kyriacou,John McLaughlin,Akheel A Syed","Thyroid disorders commonly impact on the gastrointestinal system and may even present with gastrointestinal symptoms in isolation; for example, metastatic medullary thyroid carcinoma typically presents with diarrhoea. Delays in identifying and treating the underlying thyroid dysfunction may lead to unnecessary investigations and treatment, with ongoing morbidity, and can potentially be life-threatening. Similarly, gastrointestinal diseases can impact on thyroid function tests, and an awareness of the concept and management of non-thyroidal illness is necessary to avoid giving unnecessary thyroid therapies that could potentially exacerbate the underlying gastrointestinal disease. Dual thyroid and gastrointestinal pathologies are also common, with presentations occurring concurrently or sequentially, the latter after a variable time lag that can even extend over decades. Such an association aetiologically relates to the autoimmune background of many thyroid disorders (e.g. Graves' disease and Hashimoto's thyroiditis) and gastrointestinal disorders (e.g. coeliac disease and inflammatory bowel disease); such autoimmune conditions can sometimes occur in the context of autoimmune polyglandular syndrome. Emphasis should also be given to the gastrointestinal side effects of some of the medications used for thyroid disease (e.g. anti-thyroid drugs causing hepatotoxicity) and vice versa (e.g. interferon therapy causing autoimmune thyroid dysfunction). In this review, we discuss disorders of the thyroid-gut axis and identify the evidence base behind the management of such disorders.",Gastrointestinal dysfunction; Hypothyroidism; Liver disease; Obesity; Thyroid disease; Thyrotoxicosis.

Along with the increase of computational power, deep learning algorithms are commonly used for object detection tasks. However, aerial images have large variations, and the object sizes are usually small, rendering lower detection accuracy. Besides, real-time inferencing on low-cost edge devices remains an open-ended question. In this work, we explored the usage of state-of-the-art deep learning object detection on low-cost edge hardware. We propose YOLO-RTUAV, an improved version of YOLOv4-Tiny, as the solution. We benchmarked our proposed models with various state-of-the-art models on the VAID and COWC datasets. Our proposed model can achieve higher mean average precision (mAP) and frames per second (FPS) than other state-of-the-art tiny YOLO models, especially on a low-cost edge device such as the Jetson Nano 2 GB. It was observed that the Jetson Nano 2 GB can achieve up to 12.8 FPS with a model size of only 5.5 MB.",object detection; deep learning; aerial imaging; real-time detection

Few studies have investigated the impact of TP53 mutation in ALL patients after haploidentical hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (haplo-HSCT). We completed a retrospective study of 65 ALL patients with available TP53 status who underwent haplo-HSCT. They were divided into a TP53 mutation group (TP53mut ) and a TP53 wild-type (TP53wt ) group. TP53mut showed comparable 2-year cumulative incidence of relapse (CIR) rates (13.1% vs 12.5%, P = .96) and 2-year leukemia-free survival (LFS) (74.2% vs 77.4%, P = .80) with TP53wt . No significant differences in 2-year overall survival (OS) rates (82.9% vs 87.3%, P = .61) or 2-year NRM rates (12.7% vs 10.2%, P = .69) were observed in TP53mut and TP53wt patients.

Our study showed that TP53 mutations may not be related to the unfavorable impact on survival in ALL patients after treatment with haplo-HSCT. The present results suggested that haplo-HSCT may eliminate the poor prognosis effect of TP53 mutation in ALL.",TP53 mutation; acute lymphoblastic leukemia; haploidentical hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.
1053,Adaptive Block-Propagative Background Subtraction Method for UHDTV Foreground Detection,"Beaugendre, Axel; Goto, Satoshi","This paper presents an Adapting Block-Propagative Background Subtraction (ABPBGS) designed for Ultra High Definition Television (UHDTV) foreground detection. The main idea is to detect block after block along the objects in order to skip all areas of the image in which there is no moving object. This is particularly interesting for UHDTV when the objects of interest could represent not even 0.1% of the total area. From a seed block which is determined in a previous iteration, the detection will spread along an object as long as it detects a part of that object. A block history map guaranties that each block is processed only once. Moreover, only small blocks are loaded and processed, thus saving computational time and memory usage. The process of each block is independent enough to be easily parallelized. Compared to 9 state-of-the-art works, the ABPBGS achieved the best results with an average global quality score of 0.57 (1 being the maximum) on a dataset of 4K and 8K UHDTV sequences developed for this work. None of the state-of-the-art methods could process 4K videos in reasonable time while the ABPBGS has shown an average speed of 5.18 fps. In comparison, 5 of the 9 state-of-the-art methods performed slower on 270p down-scale version of the same videos. The experiments have also shown that for the process an 8K UHDTV video the ABPBGS can divide the memory required by about 24 for a total of 450 MB.",foreground detection; block-propagation; UHDTV; ABPBGS; 8K; 4K; moving object; super hi-vision

However, the effects of sequence variations of RPMS1 in hematological malignancies and their biological significance are unclear. To explore the association between RPMS1 gene variations and hematological malignancy, the RPMS1 gene of 391 EBV-positive samples from patients with EBV-positive leukemia, myelodysplastic syndromes and lymphoma in northern China were sequenced. On the basis of phylogenetic tree and mutation characteristics of RPMS1, all the sequences were divided into five major types: RPMS1-A, RPMS1-B, RPMS1-C, RPMS1-E, and RPMS1-F. RPMS1-A type, similar to the prototype B95-8, was identified in 71.87% (281/391) of samples and was the major type in all subpopulations. The frequency of RPMS1-F type was significantly higher in all malignant hematopathy groups than in healthy donors. The Hodgkin lymphoma group contained more RPMS1-F than other malignant hematopathy groups, and acute myeloid leukemia contained more RPMS1-C type than other malignant hematopathy groups. Therefore, RPMS1-A is the main type of RPMS1 gene in northern China, and RPMS1-F may be associated with hematologic malignancies.",Epstein-Barr virus; RPMS1; malignant hematopathy; polymorphism.

Methods The study included 76 patients who underwent unilateral adrenalectomy from January 2012 to November 2021 and did not have an additional etiologic factor for hypercalcemia, During the postoperative period, the highest calcium value in six months was taken into account as the postoperative value. Calcium values were corrected according to the albumin value. Results Of the 76 patients included in the study, serum calcium levels were higher in six patients (7.9%) after adrenalectomy. Unlike the others, a decrease in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and an increase in serum creatinine values were detected in the postoperative period in this patient group. In this patient group, the corrected calcium level detected an average increase of 1.3 mg/dL. Conclusion After unilateral adrenalectomy, hypercalcemia may occur due to adrenal insufficiency. It should also be considered that there may be a decrease in GFR and increased creatinine in these patients.",adrenal insufficiency; adrenalectomy; creatinine; gfr; hypercalcemia.

In this paper we report the results of using several approaches to mitigate this sparsity condition in machine learning models specially tailored towards modeling homicides events. Since spatial resolution is a direct determinant of sparsity, we focus on the performance of these models across different resolutions of interest to police authorities. We use a simple count model as benchmark and propose some enhancements of it directed towards improving prediction performance. We then compare the results to more complex models motivated by manifold learning and graph signal processing methods. We found that the simple benchmark models are as good as state of the art models for low resolution, but, as resolution increases, the performance of machine learning models outperform the benchmark. These results provide a rationality for the use of state of the art machine learning models for homicide prediction at the high resolution of interest for the deployment of police resources.",Predictive models; Urban areas; Spatial resolution; Data models; Training; Signal resolution; Law enforcement; Crime prediction; homicides; signal processing; kernel warping; spatio-temporal sparsity

The histopathological study was observed under SEM and it confirmed that the infection of Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. ricini was higher in the root of susceptible JI-35, while incompatible interaction is observed in resistant SKI-215 genotype. The acidic and neutral proteins were maximally up-expressed with 2 to 171 kDa in treated resistant and 2 to 150 kDa in treated susceptible interactions. In resistant genotype, the leaf proteins were recognized with 3.0- and 5.8-fold higher at infection stage and post-infection stage, respectively, as compared to susceptible genotype. The highly up expressions of leaf acidic (4.76 pI) and basic (8.77 pI) proteins were found with 224.94- and 61.68-fold change, respectively during the post-infection stage in treated resistance compared to its control. The protein spots at 4.76 pI and 8.77 pI were characterized with nanoLC-MS Triple TOF and were recognized as signalling molecules small GTP binding protein (23 kDa) and actin (8 kDa), respectively, on the basis of mass spectrometry and peptide sequences. However, basic and neutral proteins were up regulated as 30.11- and 20.30-fold changes in treated susceptible compared to its control. These proteins were identified as HSP90 (10 kDa) and LEA (27 kDa) proteins. The 148 kDa protein is recognized as histidine kinase in incompatible resistant interaction compared to compatible susceptible (serine threonine protein kinase, 65 kDa) as common acidic protein at 3.80 pI during infection stage.

This study was conducted to evaluate the frequency of aberrant cytoplasmic nucleophosmin 1 expression in leukemic blast cells on formalin fixed bone marrow trephine biopsy (BMB) sections and also to correlate this data with the reference molecular method (reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction; RT-PCR and gene sequencing), where available. Immunostains were performed using mouse anti-NPM1 monoclonal antibody on 71 paraffin embedded bone marrow biopsies (BMB) of patients with AML of any French-American-British (FAB) subtype. Results of immunohistochemistry (IHC) were then compared with the reference molecular method. The proportion of NPM1 expression by immunostaining in AML cases was found to be 17%. Twelve of the total 71 cases demonstrated cytoplasmic nucleophosmin (NPMc+) on immunostaining. Eleven of the positive cases that were correlated with the molecular standard demonstrated mutation in exon 12 of NPM1 gene. Cytoplasmic nucleophosmin expression by immunostaining was found to be in complete agreement with the standard molecular method.

Here, we assessed the effect of smoking during the Assisted Reproduction Therapy (ART) on a potential marker of ovarian reserve, anti-mullerian hormone (AMH) in the follicular fluid (FF). Materials and Methods: This was a cohort prospective study to assess the association between cigarette smoking and AMH concentrations in FF in fifty-six women undergoing their first ART cycle. Self-reported smoking status over time was also collected through personal interview. The main outcome measured was the association between current smoking and AMH concentrations in FF. Smoking status was assessed by FF cotinine concentrations. Analysis of covariance was performed to test statistical interaction between the main outcome and confounders. Results: The mean concentration of AMH in follicular fluid was significantly decreased among smokers (1.02+/-0.14 vs. 1.74+/-0.15, P<0.05). No statistical interaction was found between this difference in AMH concentrations and confounders like age and BMI. Thus, our data support the idea that AMH is decreased in active smokers across the fertile age. Conclusions: The hypothesis of decreased AMH concentration in follicular fluid in female smokers was confirmed. The mechanisms through which cigarette smoking induces this fall in AMH are unknown and additional research is needed to improve our comprehension of the negative impact of smoking on ART outcomes.

Physical objects in the world are 3-D, yet traditional endoscopes can only acquire 2-D images that lack depth information. This fundamental restriction greatly limits our ability to perceive and understand the complexity of real world objects. Lack of 3-D information also hinders our ability to quantitatively measure 3-D objects. In both medical imaging and industrial inspection applications, 3-D surface imaging capability would add one more dimension, literally and figuratively, to the existing imaging technologies. Over the past decades, tremendous new technologies and methods emerged in the 3-D surface imaging field. In this paper, we first provide a classification of these technologies. We then describe each category in detail, with representative designs and examples. This overview would be useful to researchers in the field since it provides a snapshot of the current state-of-the-art, from which subsequent research in meaningful directions is encouraged.

1061,Scalable Iterative Classification for Sanitizing Large-Scale Datasets,"Li, Bo; Vorobeychik, Yevgeniy; Li, Muqun; Malin, Bradley","Cheap ubiquitous computing enables the collection of massive amounts of personal data in a wide variety of domains. Many organizations aim to share such data while obscuring features that could disclose personally identifiable information. Much of this data exhibits weak structure (e.g., text), such that machine learning approaches have been developed to detect and remove identifiers from it. While learning is never perfect, and relying on such approaches to sanitize data can leak sensitive information, a small risk is often acceptable. Our goal is to balance the value of published data and the risk of an adversary discovering leaked identifiers. We model data sanitization as a game between 1) a publisher who chooses a set of classifiers to apply to data and publishes only instances predicted as non-sensitive and 2) an attacker who combines machine learning and manual inspection to uncover leaked identifying information. We introduce a fast iterative greedy algorithm for the publisher that ensures a low utility for a resource-limited adversary. Moreover, using five text data sets we illustrate that our algorithm leaves virtually no automatically identifiable sensitive instances for a state-of-the-art learning algorithm, while sharing over 93 percent of the original data, and completes after at most five iterations.",Privacy preserving; weak structured data sanitization; game theory

The Th-230/U dating results demonstrate that ages of the rock paintings can be bracketed between 1856 +/- 16 and 1728 +/- 41yr BP corresponding to the middle to the end of the Eastern Han dynasty (AD 25 to 220). The results imply that the rock painting practices at Mt. Huashan probably lasted more than a century, and the Zuojiang rock art is younger than that at Baiyunwan and Cangyuan in Yunnan Province by 1 to 10 centuries.","High precision U/Th dating; Secondary carbonates; World Heritage; Mt, Huashan rock paintings; Zuojiang River valley"

Thirty-six participants were examined, 18 with VP (52.6 ± 18.1 years) and 18 age-matched with normal vestibulocochlear testing (NP 50.3 ± 16.5 years). This study investigated whether (i) NA, (ii) DTI changes, or (iii) ELH occur in VP, and (iv) to what extent said parameters relate. Methods included vestibulocochlear testing and MRI data analyses for neurovascular compression (NVC) and NA verification, DTI and ELS quantification. As a result, (i) NA increased NVC specificity. (ii) DTI structural integrity was reduced on the side affected by VP (p < 0.05). (iii) 61.1% VP showed mild ELH and higher asymmetry indices than NP (p > 0.05). (iv) ""Disease duration"" and ""total number of attacks"" correlated with the decreased structural integrity of the affected nerve in DTI (p < 0.001). NVC distance within the nerve's root-entry zone correlated with nerve function (Roh = 0.72, p < 0.001), nerve integrity loss (Roh = - 0.638, p < 0.001), and ELS volume (Roh = - 0.604, p < 0.001) in VP. In conclusion, this study is the first to link eighth cranial nerve function, microstructure, and ELS changes in VP to clinical features and increased vulnerability of NVC in the root-entry zone. Combined MRI with NVC or NA verification, DTI and ELS quantification increased the diagnostic accuracy at group-level but did not suffice to diagnose VP on a single-subject level due to individual variability and lack of diagnostic specificity.",DTI; Diffusion imaging; Endolymphatic hydrops; Endolymphatic space; Gadolinium-based contrast agent; Inner ear; Intravenous; MRI; Root-entry zone; Vestibular nerve; Vestibular paroxysmia.

1065,Simultaneous Feature Aggregating and Hashing for Compact Binary Code Learning,"Thanh-Toan Do; Khoa Le; Tuan Hoang; Huu Le; Nguyen, Tam, V; Ngai-Man Cheung","Representing images by compact hash codes is an attractive approach for large-scale content-based image retrieval. In most state-of-the-art hashing-based image retrieval systems, for each image, local descriptors are first aggregated as a global representation vector. This global vector is then subjected to a hashing function to generate a binary hash code. In previous works, the aggregating and the hashing processes are designed independently. Hence, these frameworks may generate suboptimal hash codes. In this paper, we first propose a novel unsupervised hashing framework in which feature aggregating and hashing are designed simultaneously and optimized jointly. Specifically, our joint optimization generates aggregated representations that can be better reconstructed by some binary codes. This leads to more discriminative binary hash codes and improved retrieval accuracy. In addition, the proposed method is flexible. It can be extended for supervised hashing. When the data label is available, the framework can be adapted to learn binary codes which minimize the reconstruction loss with respect to label vectors. Furthermore, we also propose a fast version of the state-of-the-art hashing method Binary Autoencoder to be used in our proposed frameworks. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets under various settings show that the proposed methods outperform the state-of-the-art unsupervised and supervised hashing methods.",Image search; binary hashing; aggregating; embedding

To make sample collection less uncomfortable for the donor, we have developed a method that allows CMV status determination from buccal swab samples, thus avoiding blood drawing. However, the determination fails in some cases which leads to new donors being listed for donor search without CMV status, thus hindering donor searches. In this work, we evaluated the success rate of repeating CMV status analysis from a new swab. Our results show that about 90% of the samples could be successfully determined. Due to the great importance of the CMV status in donor search, we consider the retesting approach to be highly recommended for stem cell donor registries.",CMV; donor registry; stem cell donation.
1067,The influence of context representations on cognitive control states,"Reem Alzahabi,Erika Hussey,Nathan Ward,Reem Alzahabi,Erika Hussey,Nathan Ward","Cognitive control operates via two distinct mechanisms, proactive and reactive control. These control states are engaged differentially, depending on a number of within-subject factors, but also between-group variables. While research has begun to explore if shifts in control can be experimentally modulated, little is known about whether context impacts which control state is utilized. Thus, we test if contextual factors temporarily bias the use of a particular control state long enough to impact performance on a subsequent task. Our methodology involves two parts: first participants are exposed to a context manipulation designed to promote proactive or reactive processing through amount or availability of advanced preparation within a task-switching paradigm. Then, they complete an AX-CPT task, where we assess immediate transfer on preferential adoption of one control mode over another. We present results from a Pilot Study that revealed anecdotal evidence of proactive versus reactive processing for a context manipulation using long and short preparation times. We also present data from a follow-up Registered Experiment that implements a context manipulation using long or no preparation times to assess if a more extreme context leads to pronounced differences on AX-CPT performance. Together, the results suggest that contextual representations do not impact the engagement of a particular control state, but rather, there is a general preference for the engagement of proactive control.",Context; Control state; Proactive; Reactive; Task-switching.
1068,Urban Public Space as a Didactic Platform: Raising Awareness of Climate Change through Experiencing Arts,"Lee, Keunhye","This paper investigates the meanings of urban public space, both as a didactic platform and as a way to spread awareness of climate change through art. What are the roles of public space? How do artworks intervene in urban public space? How can public art contribute to ""sustainability"" issues? I have argued that the intervention of art in urban public space offers effective ways of developing climate change art, which is understood to be an educator. Public space can be categorized into three different types: everyday, social, and symbolic spaces. These can be used as a platform for opening discussion and learning about the increased issues of the global crisis in contemporary society. I have drawn upon the representative case studies about climate change to explore how they intervene in urban public space and how they engage viewers to spread awareness, which is one of the fundamental aspects of this paper. It also stimulates viewers' perceptions and awareness of a more sustainable future through phenomenological and emotional experiences. Thus, this paper contributes to the understanding and knowledge of the relationship between art and public space with respect to raising awareness about climate change and considering how art intervenes in urban public space to create an eco-didactic platform.",climate change art; urban public space; experience; emotion; eco-didactic
1069,Moving Object Detection Using Adaptive Blind Update and RGB-D Camera,"Dorudian, Navid; Lauria, Stanislao; Swift, Stephen","A novel background subtraction approach using an RCB-D camera and an adaptive blind updating policy is introduced. This method in the initialization creates a model to store background pixels to compare each pixel of the new frame with the model in the same location to identify background pixels. The background-model update presented in this paper uses regular and blind updates which also has different criteria from existing methods. In particular, blind update frequently changes based on the background changes and the speed of moving object. This will allow the scene model to adapt to the changes in the background, detecting the stationary moving object and reducing the ghost phenomenon. In addition, the proposed bootstrapping segmentation and shadow detection are added to the system to improve the accuracy of the algorithm in shadow and depth camouflage scenarios. The proposed method is compared with the original method and the other state of the art algorithms. The experimental results show significant improvement in those videos that stationary object appears. In addition, the benchmark results also indicate strong and stable results compared to the other state of the art algorithms.",GPS-denied environments; dynamic environments; object detection; nonparametric background subtraction; background-model update; segmentation

Descriptive analysis was performed using SPSS 18.0. From 2011 to 2014, we followed 22 PHIV+ pregnant women. Median age at prenatal entry was 19 years (Interquartile range (IQR) 17.6-21.0); 86% had an AIDS diagnosis; 81% had disclosed their HIV status to partner 11. The median age at HIV diagnosis was 8.3 y (IQR 4.0-13.6), the median age at sexual debut was 16 years (IQR 14-18). At the time of prenatal care initiation, four (18%) were on their first antiretroviral treatment (ART), eight (36%) in their second regimen and nine (41%) in their third regimen or beyond, and one had no data. Seventeen of 22 (77%) had HIV-viral load (VL) > 50 copies/mL at prenatal care entry, 16 had a genotyping exam performed. Seventeen of 22 PHIV+ had VL results near delivery: 7/17 (41%) had VL < 50 copies/mL. Among those who had genotyping at prenatal entry, 11/16 (69%) had mutations associated with ARV resistance. The most frequent major mutations were K103N, M184V, T215, M41L, D67N at reverse transcriptase gene and M46, I54V and V82A at protease gene. No vertical transmissions occurred. Management of pregnancy among PHIV+ is challenging.

Sreenivasa","The aim of this paper is to explore a robust method for vowel region detection from multimode speech. In realistic scenario, speech can be classified into three modes namely; conversation, extempore, and read. The existing method detects the vowel form the speech recorded in clean environment which may not be appropriate for the multimode speech tasks. To address this issue, we proposed an approach based on continuous wavelet transform coefficients and phone boundaries for detecting the vowel regions from different modes of the speech signal. For evaluation of the proposed vowel region (VR) detection technique, TIMIT (read speech) and Bengali (read, extempore, and conversation speech) corpora are used. The proposed VR detection technique is compared to the state-of-the-art methods. The experiments has recorded significant gain in the performance of the proposed technique than the state-of-the-art methods. The efficiency of the proposed technique is shown by extracting vocal tract and excitation source features from automatically detected VRs for developing the multilingual speech mode classification (MSMC) model. The evaluation results report that the performance of the MSMC model is significantly improved when features are extracted from the vowel regions than the entire speech utterance.",Continuous wavelet transform (CWT); Phone boundary; Vowel onset point; Vowel end point; Vowel region; Multilingual speech mode classification

However, previous solutions to this type of AMMs are based on 2D unit cells that require infinite or very large size in the third dimension; they cannot integrate with conventional acoustic sensors without deteriorating the ability of acoustic wave manipulation. In order to advance their practical applications, this paper proposes an axisymmetric, microphone embedded AMM device with gradient profile as well as gradient plate thickness and gradient gap width along the axis. Both numerical simulations and experiments are performed to examine the ART effect of the proposed AMM device and demonstrate its excellent capacity of acoustic pressure amplification and multi-band acoustic filtering. Deploying a microphone in the gap does not disturb the acoustic field, so the proposed AMM sensor experimentally achieves remarkable acoustic gains over one order of magnitude. Sound waves of different frequencies are picked up by microphones at different gaps, realizing the real-time spatially splitting of the sound spectrum. The proposed AMM provides excellent immunity to broadband noise and a little weak suppression of the single tone noise while significantly amplifying acoustic signals of a given frequency.",Acoustic metamaterial; rainbow trapping; acoustic sensing enhancement; artificial acoustic structure

Seventeen OCPs were analyzed in this study. The results showed that methoxychlor was dominant accounted for 13.4% of total OCPs with a mean concentration of 167.9 +/- 33.9 ng/g lipid weight (lw), followed by heptachlor-epoxide, hexachlorocyclohexanes, endrin and DDT.

Epidemiological evidence shows gender disparities in COVID-19 severity and fatality, with non-menopausal females having milder severity and better outcomes than age-matched males. However, the difference vanishes when comparing postmenopausal women with age-matched men. It has been suggested that, to some extent, this is due to the protective role of female hormones, such as anti-Müllerian hormone and oestradiol (E2), in non-menopausal women. Oestrogens have been hypothesized to be crucial in modulating viral infection and the progression of the disease via an action on immune/inflammatory responses and angiotensin-converting enzyme type 2 expression. Hence, the most likely explanation is that, because the levels of oestrogen in females after menopause decrease, oestrogen no longer offers a beneficial effect as seen in younger females. The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the serious negative effects arising from the state of E2 deficiency. Therefore, hormone replacement therapy gains further support as the damaging effect of the decline in ovarian function affects many biological systems, and recently with the COVID-19 pandemic, oestrogen's vital role within the immune system has become quite clear. However, additional clinical investigations regarding hormone replacement therapy are urgently needed to further verify the protective and therapeutic effects of E2 on menopausal women with COVID-19.",COVID-19; oestrogen; postmenopause; premenopausal women.
1075,Attention-Based Dropout Layer for Weakly Supervised Single Object Localization and Semantic Segmentation,"Choe, Junsuk; Lee, Seungho; Shim, Hyunjung","Both weakly supervised single object localization and semantic segmentation techniques learn an object's location using only image-level labels. However, these techniques are limited to cover only the most discriminative part of the object and not the entire object. To address this problem, we propose an attention-based dropout layer, which utilizes the attention mechanism to locate the entire object efficiently. To achieve this, we devise two key components, 1) hiding the most discriminative part from the model to capture the entire object, and 2) highlighting the informative region to improve the classification power of the model. These allow the classifier to be maintained with a reasonable accuracy while the entire object is covered. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that the proposed method effectively improves the weakly supervised single object localization accuracy, thereby achieving a new state-of-the-art localization accuracy on the CUB-200-2011 and a comparable accuracy existing state-of-the-arts on the ImageNet-1k. The proposed method is also effective in improving the weakly supervised semantic segmentation performance on the Pascal VOC and MS COCO. Furthermore, the proposed method is more efficient than existing techniques in terms of parameter and computation overheads. Additionally, the proposed method can be easily applied in various backbone networks.",Task analysis; Semantics; Training; Image segmentation; Feature extraction; Computational modeling; Convolutional codes; Attention; weakly supervised; object localization; semantic segmentation

Most previous studies detected brain midline on 2D plane and did not handle hemorrhage cases well. We propose a novel and efficient hemisphere-segmentation framework (HSF) for 3D brain midline surface delineation. Specifically, we formulate the brain midline delineation as a 3D hemisphere segmentation task, and employ an edge detector and a smooth regularization loss to generate the midline surface. We also introduce a distance-weighted map to keep the attention on the midline. Furthermore, we adopt rectification learning to handle various head poses. Finally, considering the complex situation of ventricle break-in for hemorrhages in bilateral intraventricular (B-IVH) cases, we identify those cases via a classification model and design a midline correction strategy to locally adjust the midline. To our best knowledge, it is the first study focusing on delineating the brain midline surface on 3D CT images of hemorrhage patients and handling the situation of ventricle break-in.

PoFUT2 recognizes a large and diverse number of TSRs through a dynamic network of water-mediated interactions. By X-ray structural studies of C. elegans PoFUT2 complexed to a TSR of group 2, we demonstrate that this GT recognizes similarly the 3D structure of TSRs from both groups 1 and 2. Its active site is highly exposed to the solvent, suggesting that water molecules might also play an essential role in the fucosylation mechanism. We applied QM/MM methods using human PoFUT2 as a model, and found that HsPoFUT2 follows a classical SN 2 reaction mechanism in which water molecules contribute to a great extent in facilitating the release of the leaving pyrophosphate unit, causing the H transfer from the acceptor nucleophile (Thr/Ser) to the catalytic base, which is the last event in the reaction. This demonstrates the importance of water molecules not only in recognition of the ligands but also in catalysis.",Enzyme Catalysis; Fucosylation; Glycosyltransferases; Protein Glycosylation; QM/MM.

A better understanding of appetite mechanisms is necessary to modulate eating behavior and food intake, and also provide a practical approach for weight management. Although many researchers have investigated the relationships between satiation/satiety and specific factors including human physiology, psychology, and food characteristics, limited information on the interactions between factors or comparisons between the relative importance of factors in contributing to satiation/satiety have been reported. This article reviews progress and gaps in understanding individual attributes contributing to perceived satiation/satiety, the advantages of considering multiple factors together in appetite experiments, as well as the applications of nondestructive sensing in evaluating human factors contributing to relative appetite perception. The approaches proposed position characterization of appetite (satiation and satiety) for personalized and precision nutrition in relation to human status and healthy diets.

In this paper, we propose a novel supervised dimensionality reduction method, called appropriate points choosing based DAG-DNE (Apps-DAG-DNE). In Apps-DAG-DNE, we choose appropriate points to construct adjacency graphs, for example, it chooses nearest neighbors to construct inter-class graph, which can build a margin between samples if they belong to the different classes, and chooses farthest points to construct intra-class graph, which can establish relationships between remote samples if and only if they belong to the same class. Thus, Apps-DAG-DNE could find a good representation for original data. To investigate the performance of Apps-DAG-DNE, we compare it with the state-of-the-art dimensionality reduction methods on Caltech-Leaves and Yale datasets.

In this paper, a robust Multiple Object Detection and Tracking (MODT) algorithm for a non-stationary base is presented, using multiple 3D LiDARs for perception. The merged LiDAR data is treated with an efficient MODT framework, considering the limitations of the vehicle-embedded computing environment. The ground classification is obtained through a grid-based method while considering a non-planar ground. Furthermore, unlike prior works, 3D grid-based clustering technique is developed to detect objects under elevated structures. The centroid measurements obtained from the object detection are tracked using Interactive Multiple Model-Unscented Kalman Filter-Joint Probabilistic Data Association Filter (IMM-UKF-JPDAF). IMM captures different motion patterns, UKF handles the nonlinearities of motion models, and JPDAF associates the measurements in the presence of clutter. The proposed algorithm is implemented on two slightly dissimilar platforms, giving real-time performance on embedded computers. The performance evaluation metrics by MOT16 and ground truths provided by KITTI Datasets are used for evaluations and comparison with the state-of-the-art. The experimentation on platforms and comparisons with state-of-the-art techniques suggest that the proposed framework is a feasible solution for MODT tasks.",data association; ground classification; multiple object detection; multiple object tracking
1083,A Novel Adaptive Parameter Search Elastic Net Method for Fluorescent Molecular Tomography,"Wang, Hanfan; Bian, Chang; Kong, Lingxin; An, Yu; Du, Yang; Tian, Jie","Fluorescence molecular tomography (FMT) is a new type of medical imaging technology that can quantitatively reconstruct the three-dimensional distribution of fluorescent probes in vivo. Traditional Lp norm regularization techniques used in FMT reconstruction often face problems such as over-sparseness, over-smoothness, spatial discontinuity, and poor robustness. To address these problems, this paper proposes an adaptive parameter search elastic net (APSEN) method that is based on elastic net regularization, using weight parameters to combine the L1 and L2 norms. For the selection of elastic net weight parameters, this approach introduces the L0 norm of valid reconstruction results and the L2 norm of the residual vector, which are used to adjust the weight parameters adaptively. To verify the proposed method, a series of numerical simulation experiments were performed using digital mice with tumors as experimental subjects, and in vivo experiments of liver tumors were also conducted. The results showed that, compared with the state-of-the-art methods with different light source sizes or distances, Gaussian noise of 5%-25%, and the brute-force parameter search method, the APSEN method has better location accuracy, spatial resolution, fluorescence yield recovery ability, morphological characteristics, and robustness. Furthermore, the in vivo experiments demonstrated the applicability of APSEN for FMT.",Image reconstruction; Fluorescence; Probes; Mathematical model; Photonics; Molecular imaging; Biological tissues; Fluorescence molecular tomography; adaptive parameter search; elastic net
1084,Task-based parameter isolation for foreground segmentation without catastrophic forgetting using multi-scale region and edges fusion network,"Osman, Islam; Eltantawy, Agwad; Shehata, Mohamed S.","Foreground segmentation of moving objects is widely used in different computer vision applications; however, existing deep learning-based methods generally suffer from overall degraded F-measure performance. The two main sources that degrade the F-measure are under-segmentation and catastrophic forgetting. Under segmentation is the problem of misdetecting objects' fine details. The catastrophic forgetting problem occurs when training on a large number of video sequences that leads to forgetting information learned from early video sequences. This paper proposes a novel multi-scale region and edges fusion network with task-based parameter isolation (REFNet-TBPI) to overcome these two problems. The proposed method consists of a novel multi-scale region and edges fusion network (REFNet) to capture the moving objects' boundary details by extracting regions and boundary edges of each object at different feature scales and fusing them to produce high-detailed segmented objects. REFNet is trained using a novel continual learning technique called task based parameter isolation (TBPI) to overcome the catastrophic forgetting problem. The proposed method (REFNet-TBPI) is extensively evaluated on three benchmarks, namely CDnet2014, DAVIS2016, and SegTrack. By comparing REFNet-TBPI with current state-of-the-art methods, the proposed method outperforms the best reported state-of-the-art by 4.4% on average. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

At the 12-week follow-up visit, there was a significant improvement of at least 0.2 logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution (logMAR) in BCVA (p=0.001). A significantly greater percentage of patients with higher age, DM, and HT was observed in the unfavorable visual recovery (UVR) group (p=0.002, p=0.001, and p=0.005 respectively). In contrast, neither baseline visual acuity nor cup-to-disc ratio (CDR) affected the result of visual recovery (p=0.275 and p=0.076, respectively). In multivariate logistic analysis, older age increased the odds of worse visual recovery [odds ratio (OR): 4.014; 95% CI: 1.038-15.515; p=0.044], as did having DM (OR: 3.809; 95% CI: 1.168-12.421; p=0.027), and HT (OR: 4.577; 95% CI: 1.491-14.049; p=0.008). Conclusions None of the baseline visual status parameters (visual acuity, CDR, or visual field defect) was able to determine the outcome of visual recovery at 12 weeks in our NAION patients. Regarding systemic vascular diseases, diabetes and HT are significant risk factors and also predictors of poor visual improvement in Thai populations. NAION patients who are elderly or have vascular diseases such as DM or HT should be closely followed up and advised about the likelihood of having inferior visual recovery.",diabetes mellitus; hypertension; non-arteric ischemic optic neuropathy; systemic vascular disease; visual acuity; visual field; visual outcome.
1086,Robust sound event classification with bilinear multi-column ELM-AE and two-stage ensemble learning,"Zhang, Junjie; Yin, Jie; Zhang, Qi; Shi, Jun; Li, Yan","The automatic sound event classification (SEC) has attracted a growing attention in recent years. Feature extraction is a critical factor in SEC system, and the deep neural network (DNN) algorithms have achieved the state-of-the-art performance for SEC. The extreme learning machine-based auto-encoder (ELM-AE) is a new deep learning algorithm, which has both an excellent representation performance and very fast training procedure. However, ELM-AE suffers from the problem of unstability. In this work, a bilinear multi-column ELM-AE (B-MC-ELM-AE) algorithm is proposed to improve the robustness, stability, and feature representation of the original ELM-AE, which is then applied to learn feature representation of sound signals. Moreover, a B-MC-ELM-AE and two-stage ensemble learning (TsEL)-based feature learning and classification framework is then developed to perform the robust and effective SEC. The experimental results on the Real World Computing Partnership Sound Scene Database show that the proposed SEC framework outperforms the state-of-the-art DNN algorithm.",Sound event classification; Multi-column; Bilinear; Extreme learning machine auto-encoder; Ensemble learning

1088,Verification of road databases using multiple road models,"Ziems, Marcel; Rottensteiner, Franz; Heipke, Christian","In this paper a new approach for automatic road database verification based on remote sensing images is presented. In contrast to existing methods, the applicability of the new approach is not restricted to specific road types, context areas or geographic regions. This is achieved by combining several stateof-the-art road detection and road verification approaches that work well under different circumstances. Each one serves as an independent module representing a unique road model and a specific processing strategy. All modules provide independent solutions for the verification problem of each road object stored in the database in form of two probability distributions, the first one for the state of a database object (correct or incorrect), and a second one for the state of the underlying road model (applicable or not applicable). In accordance with the Dempster-Shafer Theory, both distributions are mapped to a new state space comprising the classes correct, incorrect and unknown. Statistical reasoning is applied to obtain the optimal state of a road object. A comparison with state-of-the-art road detection approaches using benchmark datasets shows that in general the proposed approach provides results with larger completeness. Additional experiments reveal that based on the proposed method a highly reliable semiautomatic approach for road data base verification can be designed.

Macrophages derived from human blood-circulating monocytes were polarised using established protocols and metabolically challenged using small molecules to validate their responding metabolic actions in extracellular acidification and oxygen consumption. Large field-of-view images of individual polarised macrophages were obtained using fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM). These were challenged in real time with small-molecule perturbations of metabolism during imaging. We uncovered FLIM parameters that are pronounced under the action of carbonyl cyanide-p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone (FCCP), which strongly stratifies the phenotype of polarised human macrophages; however, this performance is impacted by donor variability when analysing the data at a single-cell level. The stratification and parameters emanating from a full field-of-view and single-cell FLIM approach serve as the basis for machine learning models. Applying a random forests model, we identify three strongly governing FLIM parameters, achieving an area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (ROC-AUC) value of 0.944 and out-of-bag (OBB) error rate of 16.67% when classifying human macrophages in a full field-of-view image. To conclude, 2P-FLIM with the integration of machine learning models is showed to be a powerful technique for analysis of both human macrophage metabolism and polarisation at full FoV and single-cell level.",FLIM; cell biology; cellular metabolism; human; immunology; inflammation; machine learning; macrophages; multiphoton.
1090,Local Information Assisted Attention-Free Decoder for Audio Captioning,"Xiao, Feiyang; Guan, Jian; Lan, Haiyan; Zhu, Qiaoxi; Wang, Wenwu","Automated audio captioning aims to describe audio data with captions using natural language. Existing methods often employ an encoder-decoder structure, where the attention-based decoder (e.g., Transformer decoder) is widely used and achieves state-of-the-art performance. Although this method effectively captures global information within audio data via the self-attention mechanism, it may ignore the event with short time duration, due to its limitation in capturing local information in an audio signal, leading to inaccurate prediction of captions. To address this issue, we propose a method using the pretrained audio neural networks (PANNs) as the encoder and local information assisted attention-free Transformer (LocalAFT) as the decoder. The novelty of our method is in the proposal of the LocalAFT decoder, which allows local information within an audio signal to be captured while retaining the global information. This enables the events of different duration, including short duration, to be captured for more precise caption generation. Experiments show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in Task 6 of the DCASE 2021 Challenge with the standard attention-based decoder for caption generation.",Decoding; Feature extraction; Wind forecasting; Interference; Convolution; Transformers; Task analysis; Automated audio captioning; local information; attention-free transformer

Several studies emphasized the role of MBL2 gene in several infectious diseases' susceptibility, including HIV-1 infection. We aim to investigate the impact of 10 MBL2 gene polymorphisms located in the promoter, 5'UTR and exon 1 regions on HIV-1 physiopathology. The polymorphisms genotyping of 400 individuals, which 200 were HIV-1 positive patients and 200 were controls, was performed by PCR-sequencing. Our results showed that rs503037 and rs1800451 polymorphisms are associated with a high risk of HIV-1 infection susceptibility while rs7096206 and rs11003123 showed a protective effect. A significant association between haplotype CGA and HIV-1 infection susceptibility was also found in the exon 1 region. Moreover, rs11003124, rs7084554, rs36014597 and rs11003123 polymorphisms revealed an association with treatment response outcome as measured by RNA viral load.

The lack of experience with this still-new technology, together with the inherent complexity of wind farm electrical systems, entails several unresolved issues pertinent to the topic of overvoltage protection, particularly in relation to lightning-initiated surges. Firstly, several aspects of the wind turbine lightning incidence, along with the issues related to the selection of lightning current parameters (pertinent to the wind farm overvoltage protection), are addressed in this paper. Secondly, several issues in the state-of-art models of the wind farm electrical systems-for the lightning surge analysis-are addressed and discussed. Here, a well-known ElectroMagnetic Transients Program (EMTP) software package is often employed, with all of its benefits and some limitations. Thirdly, the metal-oxide surge arrester energy capability and the issues related to the selection of the surge arrester rated energy-in relation to the direct lightning strikes to wind turbines-is addressed. Finally, some general considerations concerning the overvoltage protection selection for wind farm projects, particularly regarding the installation of the metal-oxide surge arresters, are provided as well.",EMTP model; lightning; overvoltage protection; risk of failure; surge arresters; wind farm
1095,"Insight Into Factors Governing Formation, Synthesis and Stereochemical Configuration of DNA Adducts Formed by Mitomycins","Manuel M Paz,Elise Champeil,Manuel M Paz,Elise Champeil","Mitomycin C, (MC), an antitumor drug used in the clinics, is a DNA alkylating agent. Inert in its native form, MC is reduced to reactive mitosenes in cellulo which undergo nucleophilic attack by DNA bases to form monoadducts as well as interstrand crosslinks (ICLs). These properties constitute the molecular basis for the cytotoxic effects of the drug. The mechanism of DNA alkylation by mitomycins has been studied for the past 30 years and, until recently, the consensus was that drugs of the mitomycins family mainly target CpG sequences in DNA. However, that paradigm was recently challenged. Here, we relate the latest research on both MC and dicarbamoylmitomycin C (DMC), a synthetic derivative of MC which has been used to investigate the regioselectivity of mitomycins DNA alkylation as well as the relationship between mitomycins reductive activation pathways and DNA adducts stereochemical configuration. We also review the different synthetic routes to access mitomycins nucleoside adducts and oligonucleotides containing MC/DMC DNA adducts located at a single position. Finally, we briefly describe the DNA structural modifications induced by MC and DMC adducts and how site specifically modified oligonucleotides have been used to elucidate the role each adduct plays in the drugs cytotoxicity.",DNA adducts; Mitomycin C; Reductive activation; Site-specific alkylation; Structure-activity relationship.
1096,Participatory arts and affective engagement with climate change: The missing link in achieving climate compatible behaviour change?,"Burke, Miriam; Tickwell, David; Whitmarsh, Lorraine","Despite a growing number of arts based climate change interventions and the importance emphasised in the social psychology literature of achieving affective (emotional) engagement with climate change before climate compatible behaviour change is likely, to date there has been no systematic application of interpretive social science techniques to understand the ways in which these arts based interventions do or do not achieve affective public engagement with climate change and hence might hold the key to unlocking broader climate compatible behaviour change. This article makes two key contributions.. First, it analyses the literature across social psychology and participatory arts to demonstrate why participatory, climate change based arts interventions could hold the key to more effective approaches to engaging multiple publics in climate compatible behaviour change. Second, using a small sample of participants in an arts based climate change intervention, in the Inner Hebrides, Scotland, it demonstrates the potential value of combining social science techniques (in this case Q Methodology) with participatory arts interventions to better understand and learn from the ways in which climate based arts interventions achieve affective public engagement with climate change.

1097,Multiscale texture retrieval based on low-dimensional and rotation-invariant features of curvelet transform,"Cavusoglu, Bulent","Multiscale-based texture retrieval algorithms use low-dimensional feature sets in general. However, they do not have as good retrieval performances as those of the state-of-the-art techniques in the literature. The main motivation of this study is to use low-dimensional multiscale features to provide comparable retrieval performances with the state-of-the-art techniques. The proposed features of this study are low-dimensional, robust against rotation, and have better performance than the earlier multiresolution-based algorithms and the state-of-the-art techniques with low-dimensional feature sets. They are obtained through curvelet transformation and have considerably small dimensions. The rotation invariance is provided by applying a novel principal orientation alignment based on cross energies of adjacent curvelet blocks. The curvelet block pair with the highest cross energy is marked as the principle orientation, and the rest of the blocks are cycle-shifted around the principle orientation. Two separate rotation-invariant feature vectors are proposed and evaluated in this study. The first feature vector has 84 elements and contains the mean and standard deviation of curvelet blocks at each angle together with a weighting factor based on the spatial support of the curvelet coefficients. The second feature vector has 840 elements and contains the kernel density estimation (KDE) of curvelet blocks at each angle. The first and the second feature vectors are used in the classification of textures based on nearest neighbor algorithm with Euclidian and Kullback-Leibler distance measures, respectively. The proposed method is evaluated on well-known databases such as, Brodatz, TC10, TC12-t184, and TC12-horizon of Outex, UIUCTex, and KTH-TIPS. The best performance is obtained for kernel density feature vector. Mean and standard deviation feature vector also provides similar performance and has less complexity due to its smaller feature dimension. The results are reported as both precision-recall curves and classification rates and compared with the existing state-of-the-art texture retrieval techniques. It is shown through several experiments that the proposed rotation-invariant feature vectors outperform earlier multiresolution-based ones and provide comparable performances with the rest of the literature even though they have considerably small dimensions.",Texture retrieval; Low dimension; Multiresolution; Curvelet transform; Rotation invariance; Principle orientation
1098,Conjoint belief adaption functionality for statistically secure communication paradigm for CR-IIoTs,"Indra, Gaurav; Dhurandher, Sanjay Kumar; Raj, Richa","In an infrastructure-critical manufacturing industry, continuous monitoring of the assembly lines with internet-integrated sensors in an unforeseeable, stochastic, and harsh environment becomes indispensable for real-time fault detection, location, and isolation. State-of-the-art literature suggest that the Cognitive Radio-based Industrial Internet of Things (CR-IIoTs), a spectrum aware wireless communication paradigm, is best suited for monitoring as they are proficient in overcoming spectrum scarcity in a 2.4-GHz industrial, scientific, and medical (ISM) band and guarantee a threshold Quality of Service (QoS) in hostile environs. Nonetheless, CR-IIoTs and the Cognitive Radio-based network archetype are susceptible to internal and external security threats at the application layer and vulnerable to Spectrum Sensing Data Falsification (SSDF) at Data Link Layer (DLL). In CR-IIoTs, cooperative spectrum sensing (CSS) is a competent technique to ameliorate the performance of Primary User (PU) detection and optimizes the idle licensed spectrum bands access management. In this paper, a novel belief adaption framework in conjunction with an optimized secure communication scheme (termed as CBAF) based on the Certificateless-Public Key Cryptography (CL-PKC) is proposed for robust CSS in CR-IIoTs. CBAF proficiently provides full-Perfect Forward Secrecy, Ephemeral Secret Leakage-Resilience, Public Key Replacement-Resilience Malicious but Passive KGC-Resilience, and Key Escrow Resilience. Simulation analysis pertaining to network performance indices ascertains the efficacy of CBAF, as it outperforms the state-of-the-art in throughput, packet delivery ratio, and communication overhead by 8.5%, 6.7%, and 19.9% respectively. Under internal attacks, CBAF outperforms the best from state-of-the-art by 11.3% in On-Off attack, 19.7% in Data Tampering attack, 21.1% in SDF attack, and 13.4% in DDoS attack.",certificateless-PKC; CL-PKC; CR-cognitive radio; CSS-; cooperative spectrum sensing; DDoS-distributed denial of service; ISM-industrial scientific and medical; SSDF-spectrum sensing data falsification

Plant-based traditional Chinese medicines are mostly plant rhizomes, which contain a large amount of cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin. In this study, carboxylated cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) were prepared from traditional Chinese medicine residues (CMR) by sequential periodate-chlorite oxidation without mechanical treatment. The obtained nanocelluloses were analyzed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and X-ray diffractometry (XRD); the carboxyl content and specific surface area were also measured, simultaneously. XRD results revealed that the crystallinity index decreased after sequential oxidation; however, the cellulose I structure was maintained. From the morphology analysis, the average length and width of CNCs were 139.3 and 10 nm, respectively. From the FTIR analysis, with the particle size decreasing, hydrogen bonds were broken and recombined. TGA results showed that the thermal property was decreased with a reduction of nanocellulose particle size and crystallinity index. This study is the first to refine utilization of traditional Chinese medicine residues as a potential source of cellulose, that is, to prepare nanocellulose efficiently with high carboxyl content which finds its application in nanomaterials.",Chinese medicine residues; Nanocellulose; Periodate-chlorite; Purification.

The main reason is that there are some parts similar to human hands, such as wrists, faces and feet. Simply using contextual information makes it difficult to address these problems. In this paper, we propose a Context Attention Feature Pyramid Network (CA-FPN) for human hand detection. In this method, a novel Context Attention Module (CAM) is inserted into the feature pyramid networks. The CAM is designed to capture relative contextual information for hands and build long-range dependencies around hands. Our CA-FPN can achieve state-of-the-art results on two public hand detection datasets: the Oxford and Vision for Intelligent and Applications (VIVA) datasets. Furthermore, the inference time of our CA-FPN is approximately 8.5 FPS on one TITAN X GPU, indicating that it can be used in real-time applications.

Due to the interference of moving objects in the real environment, the traditional simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) system can be corrupted. To address this problem, we propose a method for static/dynamic image segmentation that leverages semantic and geometric modules, including optical flow residual clustering, epipolar constraint checks, semantic segmentation, and outlier elimination. We integrated the proposed approach into the state-of-the-art ORB-SLAM2 and evaluated its performance on both public datasets and a quadcopter platform. Experimental results demonstrated that the root-mean-square error of the absolute trajectory error improved, on average, by 93.63% in highly dynamic benchmarks when compared with ORB-SLAM2. Thus, the proposed method can improve the performance of state-of-the-art SLAM systems in challenging scenarios.</p>",SLAM; optical flow; image segmentation; dynamic objects

Our system is based entirely on 3D convolutional neural networks and achieves state-of-the-art performance for both lung nodule detection and malignancy classification tasks on the publicly available LUNA16 and Kaggle Data Science Bowl challenges. While nodule detection systems are typically designed and optimized on their own, we find that it is important to consider the coupling between detection and diagnosis components. Exploiting this coupling allows us to develop an end-to-end system that has higher and more robust performance and eliminates the need for a nodule detection false positive reduction stage. Furthermore, we characterize model uncertainty in our deep learning systems, a first for lung CT analysis, and show that we can use this to provide well-calibrated classification probabilities for both nodule detection and patient malignancy diagnosis. These calibrated probabilities informed by model uncertainty can be used for subsequent risk-based decision making towards diagnostic interventions or disease treatments, as we demonstrate using a probability-based patient referral strategy to further improve our results.",Solid modeling; Lung; Three-dimensional displays; Cancer; Computed tomography; Deep learning; Uncertainty; Machine learning; artificial neural networks; medical diagnostic imaging; image segmentation; image classification

At present, insect identification methods primarily rely on manual classification; therefore, the automatic, rapid and accurate detection of stored grain insects remains a challenge. This paper proposes an improved detection neural network architecture based on R-FCN to solve the problem of detection and classification of eight common stored grain insects. In this network, we use the multiscale training strategy with a fully convolutional network to extract more features of the insects and automatically provide the location of potentially stored grain insects through an RPN from the feature map. By using the position-sensitive score map to replace some fully-connected layers, our network is more adaptive to detect insects in complicated backgrounds, and our detection speed is improved. In addition, we also used soft-NMS to solve the superposition interference between insects and to further improve the detection accuracy. Sufficient comparative experiments are performed using our two stored grain insect detection datasets, which are carefully annotated by entomologists. Quantitative comparisons against several prior state-of-the-art methods demonstrate the superiority of our approach. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves a higher accuracy and is faster than the state-of-the-art insect image classification algorithms.",Insects; Feature extraction; Training; Machine learning; Object detection; Convolutional neural networks; Stored-grain insect; object detection; insect classification; improved R-FCN; soft-NMS

1105,Total Deep Variation: A Stable Regularization Method for Inverse Problems,"Kobler, Erich; Effland, Alexander; Kunisch, Karl; Pock, Thomas","Various problems in computer vision and medical imaging can be cast as inverse problems. A frequent method for solving inverse problems is the variational approach, which amounts to minimizing an energy composed of a data fidelity term and a regularizer. Classically, handcrafted regularizers are used, which are commonly outperformed by state-of-the-art deep learning approaches. In this work, we combine the variational formulation of inverse problems with deep learning by introducing the data-driven general-purpose total deep variation regularizer. In its core, a convolutional neural network extracts local features on multiple scales and in successive blocks. This combination allows for a rigorous mathematical analysis including an optimal control formulation of the training problem in a mean-field setting and a stability analysis with respect to the initial values and the parameters of the regularizer. In addition, we experimentally verify the robustness against adversarial attacks and numerically derive upper bounds for the generalization error.

1106,Diffusion basis functions decomposition for estimating white matter intravoxel fiber geometry,"Ramirez-Manzanares, Alonso; Rivera, Mariano; Vemuri, Baba C.; Carney, Paul; Mareci, Thomas","In this paper, we present a new formulation for recovering the fiber tract geometry within a voxel from diffusion weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data, in the presence of single or multiple neuronal fibers. To this end, we define a discrete set of diffusion basis functions. The intravoxel information is recovered at voxels containing fiber crossings or bifurcations via the use of a linear combination of the above mentioned basis functions. Then, the parametric representation of the intravoxel fiber geometry is a discrete mixture of Gaussians. Our synthetic experiments depict several advantages by using this discrete schema: the approach uses a small number of diffusion weighted images (23) and relatively small b values (1250 s/mm(2)), i.e., the intravoxel information can be inferred at a fraction of the acquisition time required for datasets involving a large number of diffusion gradient orientations. Moreover our method is robust in the presence of more than two fibers within a voxel, improving the state-of-the-art of such parametric models. We present two algorithmic solutions to our formulation: by solving a linear program or by minimizing a quadratic cost function (both with non-negativity constraints). Such minimizations are efficiently achieved with standard iterative deterministic algorithms. Finally, we present results of applying the algorithms to synthetic as well as real data.",axon fiber pathways; basis pursuit; diffusion basis functions; diffusion weighted MRI (dW-MRI); high angular resolution diffusion images (HARDI); intravoxel

In this work, we design and implement PB+tree (Pivotal B+tree) that resolves the limitations of state-of-the-art fully persistent B+trees. First, PB+tree reduces the number of expensive shift operations by up to half by managing two sub-arrays separated by a pivot key. Second, PB+tree reads cachelines in ascending order, which makes PB+tree benefit from hardware prefetchers and run faster than state-of-the-art persistent B+trees that access cachelines in non-contiguous or descending order. Third, PB+tree employs an optimistic lock-free search algorithm to avoid repeatedly visiting the same tree node. Although the optimistic lock-free search algorithm involves a risk of visiting incorrect child nodes, PB+tree guarantees correct search results using the lazy correction algorithm using doubly linked sibling pointers. Our performance study shows that PB+tree outperforms the state-of-the-art fully persistent indexes by a large margin. A search algorithm without optimistic locking risks visiting the wrong child node, but PB+tree uses a lazy correction algorithm with doubly linked sibling pointers to ensure correct search results. Our performance studies show that PB+trees outperform state-of-the-art fully persistent indexes.",Tree data structures; fault tolerance; database concurrency operations
1108,Current overview of commercially available imprint templates and directions for future development,"Maltabes, JG; Mackay, RS","Imprint lithography has been proposed as a low cost method for next generation lithography for the manufacturing of semiconductors for the 45 nm node and below, as costs for traditional optical lithography and ELTV lithography escalate to new levels that may prohibit new semiconductor devices from ever coming to the market. While this was the widely proposed use of this technology, a whole host of new areas can take advantage of this lower cost manufacturing technology also. The template enables imprinting all these devices. Template manufacturing and development is currently done alongside of state-of-the-art reticle manufacturing. While the dimensions of the 1x templates are significantly smaller than what is needed for optical lithography templates, the dimensions are on the same order as the optical assist features, scatter bars and serifs used today.

1109,"Low-noise amplifiers in wireless communications: state of the art, two new wideband all-active LNAs in SiGe-BiCMOS","Godara, Balwant; Fabre, Alain","The aim of this paper is three-fold. First, it introduces the low-noise amplifier, its relevance in modern wireless communications receivers and the performance expected of it. Then, it presents an exhaustive review of the existing topologies, presenting their advantages and shortcomings. And finally, it introduces a new class of LNAs, based on current conveyors, describing the founding principle and the performances of two new LNAs, one single-ended and the other differential. Both these new LNAs offer the following notable advantages over existent topologies: total absence of passive elements (and the smallest LNAs in their respective classes); wideband performance, with stable frequency responses from 0 to 3 GHz; easy gain control over wide ranges (0-20 dB). Comparisons with other topologies prove that the new class of LNA implementations greatly advances the state of the art. These amplifiers are ideally suited to today's multiband receivers.",All-transistor circuits; Low-noise amplifiers; Multi-band receivers; Wideband RF circuits
1110,Evo-devo perspectives on cancer,"Aurora M Nedelcu,Aurora M Nedelcu","The integration of evolutionary and developmental approaches into the field of evolutionary developmental biology has opened new areas of inquiry- from understanding the evolution of development and its underlying genetic and molecular mechanisms to addressing the role of development in evolution. For the last several decades, the terms 'evolution' and 'development' have been increasingly linked to cancer, in many different frameworks and contexts. This mini-review, as part of a special issue on Evolutionary Developmental Biology, discusses the main areas in cancer research that have been addressed through the lenses of both evolutionary and developmental biology, though not always fully or explicitly integrated in an evo-devo framework. First, it briefly introduces the current views on carcinogenesis that invoke evolutionary and/or developmental perspectives. Then, it discusses the main mechanisms proposed to have specifically evolved to suppress cancer during the evolution of multicellularity. Lastly, it considers whether the evolution of multicellularity and development was shaped by the threat of cancer (a cancer-evo-devo perspective), and/or whether the evolution of developmental programs and life history traits can shape cancer resistance/risk in various lineages (an evo-devo-cancer perspective). A proper evolutionary developmental framework for cancer, both as a disease and in terms of its natural history (in the context of the evolution of multicellularity and development as well as life history traits), could bridge the currently disparate evolutionary and developmental perspectives and uncover aspects that will provide new insights for cancer prevention and treatment.",aging; cancer; cancer suppression mechanisms; development; evolution; somatic maintenance.
1111,An ART-based fuzzy controller for the adaptive navigation of a quadruped robot,"Chen, XD; Watanabe, K; Kiguchi, K; Izumi, K","An adaptive-resonance theory (ART)-based fuzzy controller is presented for the adaptive navigation of a quadruped robot in cluttered environments, by incorporating the capability of ART in stable category recognition into fuzzy-logic control for selecting the adequate rule base. The environment category and the navigation mechanism are first described for the quadruped robot. The ART-based fuzzy controller, including an ART-based environment recognizer, a comparer, combined rule bases, and a fuzzy inferring mechanism, is next introduced for the purpose of the adaptive navigation of the quadruped robot. Unlike classical/conventional adaptive-fuzzy controllers, the present adaptive-control scheme is implemented by the adaptive selection of fuzzy-rule base in response to changes of the robot environment, which can be categorized and recognized by the proposed environment recognizer. The results of simulation and experiment show that the adaptive-fuzzy controller is effective.",adaptive control; adaptive-resonance theory (ART); fuzzy controller; navigation; obstacle avoidance; quadruped robot
1112,Hibiscus sabdariffa L. polyphenolic-rich extract promotes muscle glucose uptake and inhibits intestinal glucose absorption with concomitant amelioration of Fe2+ -induced hepatic oxidative injury,"Almahi I Mohamed,Veronica F Salau,Ochuko L Erukainure,Md Shahidul Islam,Almahi I Mohamed,Veronica F Salau,Ochuko L Erukainure,Md Shahidul Islam","In this current study, the antidiabetic effectiveness of Hibiscus sabdariffa and its protective function against Fe2+ -induced oxidative hepatic injury were elucidated using in vitro, in silico, and ex vivo studies. The oxidative damage was induced in hepatic tissue by incubation with 0.1 mMolar ferrous sulfate (FeSO4) and then treated with different concentrations of crude extracts (ethyl acetate, ethanol, and aqueous) of H. sabdariffa flowers for 30 min at 37°C. When compared to ethyl acetate and aqueous extracts, the ethanolic extract displayed the most potent scavenging activity in ferric-reducing antioxidant power (FRAP), 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), and nitric oxide (NO) assays, with IC50 values of 2.8 μl/ml, 3.3 μl/ml, and 9.2 μl/ml, respectively. The extracts significantly suppressed α-glucosidase and α-amylase activities (p < .05), with the ethanolic extract demonstrating the highest activity. H. sabdariffa significantly (p < .05) raised reduced glutathione (GSH) levels while simultaneously decreasing malondihaldehyde (MDA) and NO levels and increasing superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase activity in Fe2+ induced oxidative hepatic injury. The extract of the plant inhibited intestinal glucose absorption and increased muscular glucose uptake. The extract revealed the presence of several phenolic compounds when submitted to gas chromatography-mass Spectroscopy (GC-MS) screening, which was docked with α-glucosidase and α- amylase. The molecular docking displayed the compound 4-(3,5-Di-tert-butyl-4-hydroxyphenyl)butyl acrylate strongly interacted with α-glucosidase and α-amylase and had the lowest free binding energy compared to other compounds and acarbose. These results suggest that H. sabdariffa has promising antioxidant and antidiabetic activity. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: In recent years, there has been increased concern about the side effects of synthetic anti-diabetic drugs, as well as their expensive cost, especially in impoverished nations. This has instigated a radical shift towards the use of traditional plants, which are rich in phytochemicals many years ago. Among these plants, H. sabdariffa has been used to treat diabetes in traditional medicine. In this present study, H. sabdariffa extracts demonstrated the ability to inhibit carbohydrate digesting enzymes, facilitate muscle glucose uptake and attenuate oxidative stress in oxidative hepatic injury. Hence, demonstrating H. sabdariffa's potential to protect against oxidative damage and the complications associated with diabetes. Consumption of Hibiscus tea or juice may be a potential source for developing an anti-diabetic drug.",H. sabdariffa L.; antidiabetic; antioxidant; enzyme inhibition; molecular docking.
1113,Building Extraction from Remote Sensing Images with Sparse Token Transformers,"Chen, Keyan; Zou, Zhengxia; Shi, Zhenwei","Deep learning methods have achieved considerable progress in remote sensing image building extraction. Most building extraction methods are based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). Recently, vision transformers have provided a better perspective for modeling long-range context in images, but usually suffer from high computational complexity and memory usage. In this paper, we explored the potential of using transformers for efficient building extraction. We design an efficient dual-pathway transformer structure that learns the long-term dependency of tokens in both their spatial and channel dimensions and achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on benchmark building extraction datasets. Since single buildings in remote sensing images usually only occupy a very small part of the image pixels, we represent buildings as a set of ""sparse "" feature vectors in their feature space by introducing a new module called ""sparse token sampler "". With such a design, the computational complexity in transformers can be greatly reduced over an order of magnitude. We refer to our method as Sparse Token Transformers (STT). Experiments conducted on the Wuhan University Aerial Building Dataset (WHU) and the Inria Aerial Image Labeling Dataset (INRIA) suggest the effectiveness and efficiency of our method. Compared with some widely used segmentation methods and some state-of-the-art building extraction methods, STT has achieved the best performance with low time cost.",remote sensing images; building extraction; transformers; sparse token sampler

This analysis was conducted to evaluate the performance metrics of 3 COVID-19 case definitions among Department of Defense (DoD) beneficiaries. SARS-CoV-2 tested specimens collected from 1 March 2020 to 28 February 2021 were matched to ambulatory medical encounters (68% match). The COVID-19 case definition (ICD-10-CM: U07.1) had high specificity (99%) and positive predictive value (PPV) (94%) but low to moderate (29%-66%) sensitivity. The COVID-specific case definition (10 additional codes added), had moderate to high specificity (82-93%), moderate sensitivity (65-75%), and low to moderate PPV (23%-77%). The COVID-like illness case definition (19 additional codes added to the COVID-specific definition), had moderate specificity (65%-86%), moderate sensitivity (76%-79%), and low to moderate PPV (15%-62%). Regardless of the case definition, all metrics improved over the surveillance period. The COVID-19 case definition is ideal for studies that need to ensure all cases are true positives. However, for broad surveillance efforts, the COVID-specific case definition may be the best to maximize specificity without a large decrease in sensitivity and PPV.",COVID-19 case surveillance validation; COVID-19 surveillance.

Mathematical theories such as Hansen solubility parameters, Flory Huggins theory, Gibbs free energy, and the in silico molecular dynamics simulation study approaches were used to predict the drug-carrier miscibility. To increase the solubility further, the effervescence technique was introduced to the conventional solid dispersions to prepare effervescent solid dispersions (ESD). Solid dispersions (SDs) were prepared by microwave, solvent evaporation, lyophilization, and hot melt extrusion (HME) techniques and tested for different characterization parameters. The theoretical and in silico parameters suggested that GLB would show good miscibility with the selected carriers under certain conditions. Intermolecular hydrogen bonding between the drug and carrier(s) was confirmed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Solid-state characterizations like powder X-ray diffraction, differential scanning calorimetry, and microscopy confirm the amorphous nature of SDs. The addition of the effervescent agent improved the amorphous nature, due to which the solubility and drug release rate was increased. In vitro and ex vivo intestinal absorption studies showed improved flux and permeability than the pure drug, suggesting an enhanced drug delivery. The GLB solubility, dissolution, and stability were greatly enhanced by the SD and ESD technology.",effervescence; in silico and theoretical solubility and miscibility; in vitro-ex vivo correlation; stability.
1116,sSfS: Segmented Shape from Silhouette Reconstruction of the Human Body,"Krajnik, Wiktor; Markiewicz, Lukasz; Sitnik, Robert","Three-dimensional (3D) shape estimation of the human body has a growing number of applications in medicine, anthropometry, special effects, and many other fields. Therefore, the demand for the high-quality acquisition of a complete and accurate body model is increasing. In this paper, a short survey of current state-of-the-art solutions is provided. One of the most commonly used approaches is the Shape-from-Silhouette (SfS) method. It is capable of the reconstruction of dynamic and challenging-to-capture objects. This paper proposes a novel approach that extends the conventional voxel-based SfS method with silhouette segmentation-segmented Shape from Silhouette (sSfS). It allows the 3D reconstruction of body segments separately, which provides significantly better human body shape estimation results, especially in concave areas. For validation, a dataset representing the human body in 20 complex poses was created and assessed based on the quality metrics in reference to the ground-truth photogrammetric reconstruction. It appeared that the number of invalid reconstruction voxels for the sSfS method was 1.7 times lower than for the state-of-the-art SfS approach. The root-mean-square (RMS) error of the distance to the reference surface was also 1.22 times lower.",Shape from Silhouette; visual hull; human body segmentation; 3D reconstruction; pose estimation; volumetric methods; computer vision; multi-view images

Given the infrequency of such events, documentation of successful outcomes in single case reports aids in decision-making. A 71-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease and a BMI of 39.5 went into ventricular fibrillation half-way through a THA, after placement of a cementless acetabular component but before femoral preparation could begin. Continuation of the planned arthroplasty was aborted, the patient's wound was packed with sterile sponges and covered with an iodoform dressing, and he was flipped supine for CPR. He returned to the OR 6-hours following his arrest and his arthroplasty was completed with the original acetabular implant left in place. The patient was placed empirically on 2 weeks of IV vancomycin and 3 months of oral doxycycline based on infectious disease recommendations, and healed uneventfully. While validation of our strategy is challenging due to the infrequent nature of this event, it is hoped that this description and discussion may provide a template to those who encounter a similar challenging situation.",Antibiotic prophylaxis; Arthroplasty; Contaminated implants; Intraoperative arrest.
1119,Genetic U-Net: Automatically Designed Deep Networks for Retinal Vessel Segmentation Using a Genetic Algorithm,"Wei, Jiahong; Zhu, Guijie; Fan, Zhun; Liu, Jinchao; Rong, Yibiao; Mo, Jiajie; Li, Wenji; Chen, Xinjian","Recently, many methods based on hand-designed convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have achieved promising results in automatic retinal vessel segmentation. However, these CNNs remain constrained in capturing retinal vessels in complex fundus images. To improve their segmentation performance, these CNNs tend to have many parameters, which may lead to overfitting and high computational complexity. Moreover, the manual design of competitive CNNs is time-consuming and requires extensive empirical knowledge. Herein, a novel automated design method, called Genetic U-Net, is proposed to generate a U-shaped CNN that can achieve better retinal vessel segmentation but with fewer architecture-based parameters, thereby addressing the above issues. First, we devised a condensed but flexible search space based on a U-shaped encoder-decoder. Then, we used an improved genetic algorithm to identify better-performing architectures in the search space and investigated the possibility of finding a superior network architecture with fewer parameters. The experimental results show that the architecture obtained using the proposed method offered a superior performance with less than 1% of the number of the original U-Net parameters in particular and with significantly fewer parameters than other state-of-the-art models. Furthermore, through in-depth investigation of the experimental results, several effective operations and patterns of networks to generate superior retinal vessel segmentations were identified.

Copper-responsive fluorescent probes offer powerful tools to study labile copper pools, but most of these reagents target Cu(I), with limited methods for monitoring Cu(II) owing to its potent fluorescence quenching properties. Here, we report an activity-based sensing strategy for turn-on, oxidation state-specific detection of Cu(II) through metal-directed acyl imidazole chemistry. Cu(II) binding to a metal and oxidation state-specific receptor that accommodates the harder Lewis acidity of Cu(II) relative to Cu(I) activates the pendant dye for reaction with proximal biological nucleophiles and concomitant metal ion release, thus avoiding fluorescence quenching. Copper-directed acyl imidazole 649 for Cu(II) (CD649.2) provides foundational information on the existence and regulation of labile Cu(II) pools, including identifying divalent metal transporter 1 (DMT1) as a Cu(II) importer, labile Cu(II) increases in response to oxidative stress induced by depleting total glutathione levels, and reciprocal increases in labile Cu(II) accompanied by decreases in labile Cu(I) induced by oncogenic mutations that promote oxidative stress.",activity-based sensing; cancer metabolism; fluorescent copper probe; oxidative stress; transition metal signaling.

However, existing supervoxel segmentation algorithms cannot generate hierarchical supervoxel segmentation well preserving the spatiotemporal boundaries in real time, which prevents the downstream applications from accurate and efficient processing. In this paper, we propose a real-time hierarchical supervoxel segmentation algorithm based on the minimum spanning tree (MST), which achieves state-of-the-art accuracy meanwhile at least 11x faster than existing methods. In particular, we present a dynamic graph updating operation into the iterative construction process of the MST, which can geometrically decrease the numbers of vertices and edges. In this way, the proposed method is able to generate arbitrary scales of supervoxels on the fly. We prove the efficiency of our algorithm that can produce hierarchical supervoxels in the time complexity of O(n), where n denotes the number of voxels in the input video. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations on public benchmarks demonstrate that our proposed algorithm significantly outperforms the state-ofthe-art algorithms in terms of supervoxel segmentation accuracy and computational efficiency. Furthermore, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method on a downstream application of video object segmentation.",Supervoxel; video segmentation; minimum spanning tree
1124,Scale Insects Support Natural Enemies in Both Landscape Trees and Shrubs Below Them,"Caleb J Wilson,Steven D Frank,Caleb J Wilson,Steven D Frank","Scale insects are frequently abundant on urban trees. Although scales can worsen tree condition, some tree species tolerate moderate scale densities. Scales are prey for many natural enemies. Therefore, scale-infested trees may conserve natural enemies in their canopies and in nearby plants. We examined if scale-infested oaks-Quercus phellos L.-hosted more natural enemies than scale-uninfested oaks-Q. acutissima Carruth. and Q. lyrata Walter in Raleigh, NC. USA. We also tested if natural enemies were more abundant in holly shrubs (Ilex spp.) planted below scale-infested compared to scale-uninfested oaks. We collected natural enemies from the canopies of both tree types and from holly shrubs planted below these trees. To determine if tree type affected the abundance of natural enemies that passively dispersed to shrubs, we created hanging cup traps to collect arthropods as they fell from trees. To determine if natural enemies became more abundant on shrubs below scale-infested compared to scale-uninfested trees over short time scales, we collected natural enemies from holly shrubs below each tree type at three to six-day intervals. Scale-infested trees hosted more natural enemies than scale-uninfested trees and shrubs below scale-infested trees hosted more natural enemies than shrubs under scale-uninfested trees. Natural enemy abundance in hanging cup traps did not differ by tree type; however, shrubs underneath scale-infested trees accumulated more natural enemies than shrubs under scale-uninfested trees in six to nine days. Tolerating moderate pest densities in urban trees may support natural enemy communities, and thus biological control services, in shrubs below them.",conservation biological control; natural enemy; scale insect; urban tree.

But how do affective and spatial aspects interact? Does affect modulate the way we encode the spatial context of events? We investigated how one element of affect, namely aesthetic liking, modulates memory for location, in three online experiments (n = 124, 79, and 80). Participants visited a professionally curated virtual art exhibition. They then relocated previously viewed artworks on the museum map and reported how much they liked them. Across all experiments, liking an artwork was associated with increased ability to recall the wall on which it was hung. The effect was not explained by viewing time and appeared to modulate recognition speed. The liking-wall memory effect remained when participants attended to abstractness, rather than liking, and when testing occurred 24 h after the museum visit. Liking also modulated memory for the room where a work of art was hung, but this effect primarily involved reduced room memory for disliked artworks. Further, the liking-wall memory effect remained after controlling for effects of room memory. Recalling the wall requires recalling one's facing direction, so our findings suggest that positive aesthetic experiences enhance first-person spatial representations. More generally, a first-person component of positive affect transfers to wider spatial representation and facilitates the encoding of locations in a subject-centered reference frame. Affect and spatial representations are therefore important, and linked, elements of sentience and subjectivity. Memories of aesthetic experiences are also spatial memories of how we encountered a work of art. This linkage may have implications for museum design.",aesthetics; affect; first person; memory; spatial representation.

Agonist binding promotes transition from a resting state to an activated state, and then rapidly to a desensitized state. Recently, cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of the human α7 receptor in nanodiscs were reported in multiple conformations. These were selectively stabilized by inhibitory, activating, or potentiating compounds. However, the functional annotation of these structures and their differential interactions with unresolved lipids and ligands remain incomplete. Here, we characterized their ion permeation, membrane interactions, and ligand binding using computational electrophysiology, free-energy calculations, and coarse-grained molecular dynamics. In contrast to nonconductive structures in apparent resting and desensitized states, the structure determined in the presence of the potentiator PNU-120596 was consistent with an activated state permeable to Ca2+. Transition to this state was associated with compression and rearrangement of the membrane, particularly in the vicinity of the peripheral MX helix. An intersubunit transmembrane site was implicated in selective binding of either PNU-120596 in the activated state or cholesterol in the desensitized state. This substantiates functional assignment of all three lipid-embedded α7-receptor structures with ion-permeation simulations. It also proposes testable models of their state-dependent interactions with lipophilic ligands, including a mechanism for allosteric modulation at the transmembrane subunit interface.",cholesterol; coarse-grained simulations; computational electrophysiology; ligand-gated ion channel; nicotinic acetylcholine receptor.

Although FIR filter offers many advantages, its convolution nature poises a challenge in parallelization due to data dependency and computational complexity. To resolve this, we propose a novel FPGA-based reconfigurable filter architecture, which processes several data samples in parallel and breaks down data interdependency in a spiral fashion. Experimental results show a throughput of 7.2 GSPS with an operating frequency of only 450MHz for a filter length of 11 with 16 parallel inputs. With parallelization of 4, it is 4.44 times faster than the state-of-the-art solution for a filter length of 16 and a promising 1.04 GSPS throughput is achieved for a higher order of length 61.

PV patients develop pathogenic anti-desmoglein (Dsg) 3 ± 1 and antimitochondrial antibodies (AMA), but it remained unknown whether and how AMA enter KCs and why other cell types are not affected in PV. Therefore, we sought to elucidate mechanisms of cell entry, trafficking, and pathogenic action of AMA in PV. We found that PVIgGs associated with neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) on the cell membrane, and the PVIgG-FcRn complexes entered KCs and reached mitochondria where they dissociated. The liberated AMA altered mitochondrial membrane potential, respiration, and ATP production and induced cytochrome c release, although the lack or inactivation of FcRn abolished the ability of PVIgG to reach and damage mitochondria and to cause detachment of KCs. The assays of mitochondrial functions and keratinocyte adhesion demonstrated that although the pathobiological effects of AMA on KCs are reversible, they become irreversible, leading to epidermal blistering (acantholysis), when AMA synergize with anti-Dsg antibodies. Thus, it appears that AMA enter a keratinocyte in a complex with FcRn, become liberated from the endosome in the cytosol, and are trafficked to the mitochondria, wherein they trigger pro-apoptotic events leading to shrinkage of basal KCs uniquely expressing FcRn in epidermis. During recovery, KCs extend their cytoplasmic aprons toward neighboring cells, but anti-Dsg antibodies prevent assembly of nascent desmosomes due to steric hindrance, thus rendering acantholysis irreversible. In conclusion, FcRn is a common acceptor protein for internalization of AMA and, perhaps, for PV autoantibodies to other intracellular antigens, and PV is a novel disease paradigm for investigating and elucidating the role of FcRn in this autoimmune disease and possibly other autoimmune diseases.",antibody; antigen; autoimmunity; keratinocyte; mitochondria; mitochondrial apoptosis; pemphigus; skin.

1133,Human actions recognition: an approach based on stable motion boundary fields,"Lassoued, Imen; Zagrouba, Ezzeddine","Automatic video action recognition have been a long-standing problem in computer vision. To obtain a scalable solution for actions recognition, it is important to have efficient visual representation of motions. In this paper, we propose a new visual representation for actions based in the body motion boundaries. The first step, a set of optical flow frames highlighting the principal motions in the poses is substracted. Then, the motion boundaries are computed from the previous optical flow frames. Maximum Stable Extremal Regions are then applied to motion boundaries maps in order to obtain Motion Stable Shape (MSS) features. Local descriptors were computed based on each detected MSS to capture motion patterns. To predict the classes of the different human actions, we have represented different descriptors with a bag-of-words (BOW) model and for classification, we use a non-linear support vector machine. We have performed a set of experiments on different datasets: Weizmann, KTH, UCF sport, UCF50 and Hollywood to prove the efficiency of our developed model. The achieved results improve the state-of-the-art on the KTH and Weizmann datasets and are comparable to state-of-the-art for UCF sport and UCF50 datasets.",Video sequences; Human action recognition; Motion boundary; Stable regions

However, bibliometric studies that organize the production in this field are still scarce. The objective of this study is thus to provide a bibliometric analysis of research on sustainable practices in tourism related to marketing, identifying the state of the art, trends and other indicators, by monitoring the articles published on the Web of Science (WoS) platform. A sample of 694 materials was obtained. The data were processed and the results graphically illustrated using the VOSviewer software. The study analyzed the simultaneous occurrence of publications by year, keyword trends, cocitations, bibliographic coupling and analysis of coauthorship, countries and institutions, and indicates that the literature on tourism sustainability issues in the field of tourism marketing is growing at a quick pace; merely five papers accounted for more than 2193 citations, but there are several prolific authors. Of the 694 sources included in the review, the most important ones published 40.34% of the papers; Spain is the leading country in this topic. This research provides insight about the state of the art and identifies gaps and research opportunities in sustainability and tourism marketing.",sustainability; sustainable tourism; tourism management; ecotourism; destination marketing; bibliometric analysis; systematic literature review

Deep learning algorithms for skin cancer detection have become popular in recent years. A novel framework based on deep learning is proposed in this study for the multiclassification of skin cancer types such as Melanoma, Melanocytic Nevi, Basal Cell Carcinoma and Benign Keratosis. The proposed model is named as SCDNet which combines Vgg16 with convolutional neural networks (CNN) for the classification of different types of skin cancer. Moreover, the accuracy of the proposed method is also compared with the four state-of-the-art pre-trained classifiers in the medical domain named Resnet 50, Inception v3, AlexNet and Vgg19. The performance of the proposed SCDNet classifier, as well as the four state-of-the-art classifiers, is evaluated using the ISIC 2019 dataset. The accuracy rate of the proposed SDCNet is 96.91% for the multiclassification of skin cancer whereas, the accuracy rates for Resnet 50, Alexnet, Vgg19 and Inception-v3 are 95.21%, 93.14%, 94.25% and 92.54%, respectively.

1136,Dynamic Binary Countdown for Massive IoT Random Access in Dense 5G Networks,"Vilgelm, Mikhail; Linares, Sergio Rueda; Kellerer, Wolfgang","Massive connectivity for Internet of Things applications is expected to challenge the way access reservation protocols are designed in 5G networks. Since the number of devices and their density are envisioned to be orders of magnitude larger, state-of-the-art access reservation, random access (RA) procedure, might be a bottleneck for end-to-end delay. This would be especially challenging for burst arrival scenarios: semisynchronous triggering of a large number of devices due to a common event (blackout, emergency alarm, etc.). In this paper, to improve RA procedure scalability, we propose to combine binary countdown contention resolution (BCCR) with the state-of-theart access class barring (ACB). We present a joint analysis of ACB and BCCR and apply a framework for treating RA as a biobjective optimization, minimizing the resource consumption and maximizing the throughput of the procedure in every contention round. We use this framework to devise dynamic load-adaptive algorithm and simulatively illustrate that the proposed algorithm reduces the burst resolution delay while consuming less resources compared to the state-of-the-art techniques.",5G new radio (NR); contention resolution; machine-to-machine (M2M); random access (RA); RA channel (RACH)
1137,A new classification method using soft decision-making based on an aggregation operator of fuzzy parameterized fuzzy soft matrices,"Memis, Samet; Enginoglu, Serdar; Erkan, Ugur","Recently, a precise and stable machine learning algorithm, i.e. eigenvalue classification method (EigenClass), has been developed by using the concept of generalised eigenvalues in contrast to common approaches, such as k-nearest neighbours, support vector machines, and decision trees. In this paper, we offer a new classification algorithm called fuzzy parameterized fuzzy soft aggregation classifier (FPFS-AC) to combine the modelling ability of soft decision-making (SDM) and classification success of generalised eigenvalues. FPFS-AC constructs a decision matrix by employing the similarity measures of fuzzy parameterized fuzzy soft matrices (fpfs-matrices) and a generalised eigenvalue-based similarity measure. Then, it applies an SDM method based on the aggregation operator of fpfs-matrices to a decision matrix and classifies the given test sample. Afterwards, we perform an experimental study using 15 UCI datasets to manifest the success of our approach and compare FPFS-AC with the well-known and state-of-the-art classifiers (kNN, SVM, fuzzy kNN, EigenClass, and BM-fuzzy kNN) in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, macro F-score, micro F-score, and running time. Moreover, we statistically analyse the experimentally obtained data. Experimental and statistical results show that FPFS-AC outperforms the state-of-the-art classifiers in all the datasets concerning the five performance metrics.",Fuzzy sets; soft sets; soft decision-making (SDM); fpfs -matrices; supervised learning; data classification
1138,Relationship Induced Multi-Template Learning for Diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease and Mild Cognitive Impairment,"Liu, Mingxia; Zhang, Daoqiang; Shen, Dinggang","As shown in the literature, methods based on multiple templates usually achieve better performance, compared with those using only a single template for processing medical images. However, most existing multi-template based methods simply average or concatenate multiple sets of features extracted from different templates, which potentially ignores important structural information contained in the multi-template data. Accordingly, in this paper, we propose a novel relationship induced multi-template learning method for automatic diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and its prodromal stage, i.e., mild cognitive impairment (MCI), by explicitly modeling structural information in the multi-template data. Specifically, we first nonlinearly register each brain's magnetic resonance (MR) image separately onto multiple pre-selected templates, and then extract multiple sets of features for this MR image. Next, we develop a novel feature selection algorithm by introducing two regularization terms to model the relationships among templates and among individual subjects. Using these selected features corresponding to multiple templates, we then construct multiple support vector machine (SVM) classifiers. Finally, an ensemble classification is used to combine outputs of all SVM classifiers, for achieving the final result. We evaluate our proposed method on 459 subjects from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database, including 97 AD patients, 128 normal controls (NC), 117 progressive MCI (pMCI) patients, and 117 stable MCI (sMCI) patients. The experimental results demonstrate promising classification performance, compared with several state-of-the-art methods for multi-template based AD/MCI classification.",Alzheimer's disease; ensemble classification; multi-template representation; sparse feature selection
1139,A multi-objective neural network trained with differential evolution for dynamic economic emission dispatch,"Mason, Karl; Duggan, Jim; Howley, Enda",Multi-objective optimisation has received considerable attention in recent years as many real world problems have multiple conflicting objectives. There is an additional layer of complexity when considering multi-objective problems in dynamic environments due to the changing nature of the problem. A novel Multi-Objective Neural Network trained with Differential Evolution (MONNDE) is presented in this research. MONNDE utilizes Neural Network function approximators to address dynamic multi-objective optimisation problems. Differential Evolution (DE) is a state of the art single objective global optimisation problems and will be used to evolve neural networks capable of generating Pareto fronts. The proposed MONNDE algorithm has the added advantage of developing an approximation of the problem that can produce further Pareto fronts as the environment changes with no further optimisation needed. The MONNDE framework is applied to the Dynamic Economic Emission Dispatch (DEED) problem and performs equally optimal when compared to other state of the art algorithms in terms of the 24 h cost and emissions. This research also compares the performance of fully and partially connected networks and discovers that dynamically optimising the topology of the neural networks performs better in an online learning environment than simply optimising the network weights.,Multi-objective; Neural networks; Differential evolution; Evolutionary neural networks; Dynamic economic emission dispatch

Food segmentation is an important problem as the first step for nutrition monitoring, food volume and calorie estimation. Our novel architecture incorporates both channel attention and spatial attention information in an expanded multi-scale feature representation using our advanced Waterfall Atrous Spatial Pooling module. GourmetNet refines the feature extraction process by merging features from multiple levels of the backbone through the two attention modules. The refined features are processed with the advanced multi-scale waterfall module that combines the benefits of cascade filtering and pyramid representations without requiring a separate decoder or post-processing. Our experiments on two food datasets show that GourmetNet significantly outperforms existing current state-of-the-art methods.",semantic segmentation; food segmentation; multi-scale features; spatial attention; channel attention

In the northernmost region of Chile, the most frequent archaeological indicators of these caravan systems are trails and rock art images. Cruces de Molinos (LL-43), a rock art site in the Lluta valley, 1100 masl, 40 km from the Pacific littoral, expands the ceremonial role of rock art sites, materialized, not only as regards the iconography portrayed and alluding to these practices, but also in terms of articulated carcass remains and detached anatomical units of camelids, intentionally deposited in a cache beneath one of the engraved blocks. This paper analyzes the site considering the visual imagery, spatial location, archaeological deposits and features associated with rock art. Based on the predominance of camelid and caravan motifs in rock art images, the extraordinary setting and location of the site on the valleys upper slopes, which is far removed from local settlements, but closely connected with a llama caravan trade network linking the chaupiyunga ecozone with the highlands (sierra and Altiplano ecozones), we suggest that Cruces de Molinos was not a rest stop for caravanners, but a ceremonial place, and not for local farmers, but for highland herders.

The current study evaluates the activity of PPN and synergism with RIF in rapidly and slowly growing nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM). Also, to propose a possible mechanism of interaction of PPN with M. leprae (Mlp) RNA polymerase (RNAp). Minimal inhibitory concentration and drug combination assay was determined by resazurin microtiter assay and resazurin drug combination assay, respectively. In silico evaluation of PPN binding was performed by molecular docking and molecular dynamics (MD). PPN showed higher antimicrobial activity against rapidly growing NTM (32-128 mg/L) rather than for slowly growing NTM (≥ 256 mg/L). Further, 77.8% of NTM tested exhibited FICI ≤ 0.5 when exposed to PPN and RIF combination, regardless of growth speed. Docking and MD simulations showed a possible PPN binding site at the interface between β and β' subunits of RNAp, in close proximity to the trigger-helix and bridge-helix elements. MD results indicated that PPN binding hindered the mobility of these elements, which are essential for RNA transcription. We hypothesize that PPN binding might affect mycobacterial RNAp activity, and, possibly, RIF activity and that this mechanism is partially responsible for synergic behaviors with RIF reported in vitro.

The success of CNN-based methods relies on a large number of labeled data. The state-of-the-art synthesizes such data using a coarse morphable face model, which however has difficulty to generate detailed photo-realistic images of faces (with wrinkles). This paper presents a novel face data generation method. Specifically, we render a large number of photo-realistic face images with different attributes based on inverse rendering. Furthermore, we construct a fine-detailed face image dataset by transferring different scales of details from one image to another. We also construct a large number of video-type adjacent frame pairs by simulating the distribution of real video data.(1) With these nicely constructed datasets, we propose a coarse-to-fine learning framework consisting of three convolutional networks. The networks are trained for real-time detailed 3D face reconstruction from monocular video as well as from a single image. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our framework can produce high-quality reconstruction but with much less computation time compared to the state-of-the-art. Moreover, our method is robust to pose, expression and lighting due to the diversity of data.",3D face reconstruction; face tracking; face performance capturing; 3D face dataset; image synthesis; deep learning

The resulting network resembles a static entity of knowledge, with endeavours to extend this knowledge without targeting the original task resulting in a catastrophic forgetting. Continual learning shifts this paradigm towards networks that can continually accumulate knowledge over different tasks without the need to retrain from scratch. We focus on task incremental classification, where tasks arrive sequentially and are delineated by clear boundaries. Our main contributions concern: (1) a taxonomy and extensive overview of the state-of-the-art; (2) a novel framework to continually determine the stability-plasticity trade-off of the continual learner; (3) a comprehensive experimental comparison of 11 state-of-the-art continual learning methods; and (4) baselines. We empirically scrutinize method strengths and weaknesses on three benchmarks, considering Tiny Imagenet and large-scale unbalanced iNaturalist and a sequence of recognition datasets.

To date, three genes have been identified to cause three types of PH (I, II, and III). The HOGA1 gene caused type III in around 10% of the PH cases. Disease-associated pathogenic variants have been reported from several populations and a comprehensive spectrum of these mutations and genotype-phenotype correlation has never been presented. In this study, we describe new cases of the HOGA1 gene pathogenic variants identified in our population. We report the first case of ESKD with successful kidney transplantation with 5 years of follow-up. Furthermore, a comprehensive overview of PH type III associated HOGA1 gene variants was carried out. Compiling the data from the literature, we reviewed 57 distinct HOGA1 gene pathogenic variants in 175 patients worldwide. The majority of reported variants are missense variants that predicted a loss of function mechanism as the underlying pathology. There has been evidence of the presence of founder mutations in several populations like Europeans, Ashkenazi Jews, Arab, and Chinese populations. No significant genotype-phenotype correlation was identified concerning the ages of onset of the disease and biochemical and metabolic parameters. Nephrocalcinosis was rare in patients with disease-associated variants. Most of the patients were presented with urolithiasis early in life; only five cases reported disease progression after the second decade of life. The establishment of impairment of renal function in 8% of all the reported cases makes this type a relatively severe form of primary hyperoxaluria, not a benign etiology as suggested previously.",HOGA1; disease-associated variants; end-stage renal disease; glyoxylate metabolism; nephrocalcinosis; primary hyperoxaluria; urolithiasis.

At the same time, mosquitoes are vectors for numerous dreadful diseases, which is the most important group of insect for their public health concern. Using synthetic insecticides to control the pests can lead to contamination of land surface and groundwater and impact beneficial soil organisms and nontarget species. Applications of bioactive compounds are received considerable attention across the world as alternatives to synthetic insecticides. In the current study, actinobacterial secondary metabolite was isolated from Actinokineospora fastidiosa for the first time. The effect of actinobacterial metabolite (l-isoleucine, N-allyloxycarbonyl-, and dodecyl ester) was assessed on agricultural pest S. litura and H. armigera, mosquito vectors larvae Ae. aegypti, An. stephensi, and Cx. quinquefasciatus. The bioactive fraction was characterized through UV, FTIR, and NMR analysis. GC-MS analyses reveal the existence of a bioactive compound with a respective retention time of 19.740 responsible for larvicidal activity. The bioefficacy of the l-isoleucine, N-allyloxycarbonyl-, and dodecyl ester showed high antifeedant activity on S. litura (80.80%) and H. armigera (84.49%); and larvicidal activity on S. litura (82.77%) and H. armigera (88.00%) at 25 μg/mL concentration, respectively.

The cartography of the formation processes in the cave and the petrographic analysis of samples collected from the ground show that following a superficial dissolution of the limestone, the rock became softer, thus facilitating engraving, even with a soft tool. The analyses (X-ray Diffraction, X-ray Fluorescence, Raman Spectrometry) indicate a relative concentration of goethite, responsible for the orangish patina visible on the wall surfaces. When engraved, the lighter material under this patina is exposed in the bottom of the incised lines, creating contrasting colors that contribute to the visibility of the depictions. Finally, the alteration of the limestone created a surface that also facilitated the realization of more tenuous marks, such as finger-tracings, as well as involuntary marks made by resting hands.

Specifically, the proposed algorithm utilizes the correntropy induced metric (CIM) for defining a similarity measure, a node insertion criterion, and an edge creation criterion. Other types of the ART-based topological clustering algorithms have been developed, however, these algorithms have various drawbacks such as a large number of parameters, sensitivity to noisy data. Moreover, generated topological networks cannot represent the distribution of data. In contrast, the proposed algorithm realizes a stable computation and reduces the number of parameters compared to existing algorithms. Furthermore, improving the ability to express the data structure more appropriately by the topological network, a mechanism that adaptively controls the node insertion criterion is introduced to the proposed algorithm. The experimental results showed that the proposed algorithm has superior performance with respect to the self-organizing and the classification abilities compared with the state-of-the-art topological clustering algorithms.",Adaptive resonance theory; correntropy; information theoretic learning; topological clustering
1149,Human representations in the Late Palaeolithic and Mesolithic art of north-western Europe,"Plonka, Tomasz","Anthropomorphic motifs in Late Palaeolithic and Mesolithic art of north-western Europe are extremely rare. In this article they are reviewed and discussed from the perspective of style and narrative character. Most of the anthropomorphic images were engraved on various materials - antler, bone or stone; a much less common technique of portraying the human figure was by drilling small holes. Quite often these representations appear in company with other motifs, mostly geometrical. Late Palaeolithic human images are rather diverse in their style: next to the semirealistic style, the geometric style is much in evidence. The latter becomes widespread during the Mesolithic, occurring in various conventions: linear geometrical (the human figure is built by lines, strokes or drilled dots), figural geometrical (the figure is built by geometric figures or densely engraved lines) and with an exaggerated face. The style of these representations becomes particularly heterogeneous during the late Mesolithic, possibly as a result of increasingly sedentary mode of life and the rise of many local variants of the artwork styles. Most of the anthropomorphs under discussion are portrayed in action: dancing, carrying various objects, engaged in rituals. However, the nature of these activities is difficult to fathom due to the geometricised, often quite spare style of these anthropomorphic representations.",Human representation; Late Palaeolithic; Mesolithic; Engraving

The scientific problem raised here involves the issue of high-ranking martial arts teachers taking trips for their own studies (to acquire knowledge and skills) and teaching others. Some of the questions addressed include how often the trips occur (single, sporadic, or multiple, regular), what their effects are, and what their meaning is-in the opinion of these experts. The ""Martial Arts Tourism"" questionnaire was addressed to N = 12 people, masters/teachers of high-rank in martial arts (level 7-10 dan/toan) who live and teach in Europe and the USA, but come from Europe. They are the holders of the highest degrees in Chinese, Japanese and Korean styles. Further questions were asked through direct correspondence. The collected statements were usedby means of qualitative analysis-as in the method of 'expert courts'/'competent judges'. The respondents in most cases undertook trips from Europe to East Asia for their own learning. They teach themselves mainly in their own countries and in Europe. Stays rarely lasted over two weeks. The respondents are convinced of the legitimacy of this type of trip, and believe that the trips are very helpful on the way to mastery. None of the respondents mentioned the material forms of cultural heritage pertaining to martial arts as motives for the trips. Therefore, the ability to visit historic places is a marginal concern.

1152,Fixed Point Iteration Based Algorithm for Asynchronous TOA-Based Source Localization,"Zou, Yanbin; Fan, Jingna; Wu, Liehu; Liu, Huaping","This paper investigates the problem of source localization using signal time-of-arrival (TOA) measurements in the presence of unknown start transmission time. Most state-of-art methods are based on convex relaxation technologies, which possess global solution for the relaxed optimization problem. However, computational complexity of the convex optimization-based algorithm is usually large, and need CVX toolbox to solve it. Although the two stage weighted least squares (2SWLS) algorithm has very low computational complexity, its estimate performance is susceptible to sensor geometry and threshold phenomenon. A new algorithm that is directly derived from maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) is developed. The newly proposed algorithm is named as fixed point iteration (FPI); it only involves simple calculations, such as addition, multiplication, division, and square-root. Unlike state-of-the-art methods, there is no matrix inversion operation and can avoid the unstable performance incurred by singular matrix.

1153,Local adaptive approach toward segmentation of microscopic images of activated sludge flocs,"Khan, Muhammad Burhan; Nisar, Humaira; Ng, Choon Aun; Lo, Po Kim; Yap, Vooi Voon","Activated sludge process is a widely used method to treat domestic and industrial effluents. The conditions of activated sludge wastewater treatment plant (AS-WWTP) are related to the morphological properties of flocs (microbial aggregates) and filaments, and are required to be monitored for normal operation of the plant. Image processing and analysis is a potential time-efficient monitoring tool for AS-WWTPs. Local adaptive segmentation algorithms are proposed for bright-field microscopic images of activated sludge flocs. Two basic modules are suggested for Otsu thresholding-based local adaptive algorithms with irregular illumination compensation. The performance of the algorithms has been compared with state-of-the-art local adaptive algorithms of Sauvola, Bradley, Feng, and c-mean. The comparisons are done using a number of region-and nonregion-based metrics at different microscopic magnifications and quantification of flocs. The performance metrics show that the proposed algorithms performed better and, in some cases, were comparable to the state-of the-art algorithms. The performance metrics were also assessed subjectively for their suitability for segmentations of activated sludge images. The region-based metrics such as false negative ratio, sensitivity, and negative predictive value gave inconsistent results as compared to other segmentation assessment metrics.

1155,The microscopic visual forms in architectural art design following deep learning,"Guo, Yi","The purpose is to analyze the architectural art design of microscopic visual forms based on deep learning. First, GAN (Generative Adversarial Networks) of deep learning is applied to the field of architecture, and a multi-adversarial information sharing GAN is proposed through the improvement of GAN, and an architecture generation model of microscopic visual forms based on deep learning is constructed. The model is stimulated and its accuracy, distortion, and stability are analyzed. The results show that the accuracy of the model can reach more than 80% on different datasets. Compared with the other models in the related field, the model built in this study can show the features of the building images with the minimum distortion. Meanwhile, the curve hovers are around 0 in the process of model training, which is balanced. Therefore, the research can significantly improve the accuracy and the effect of feature extraction, and provide an experimental basis for the later architectural design of microscopic visual forms.",Deep learning; Micro-morphology; Generative adversarial networks; Architectural art; Convolutional neural network
1156,Image Super-Resolution Using Aggregated Residual Transformation Networks With Spatial Attention,"Xing, Xingrun; Zhang, Dawei","For a long time, previous studies focused on convolutional neural network depth and width to improve accuracy in image super-resolution tasks. Although overall performance has grown as going deeper and going wider over time, until recently, these two elements start to show saturating accuracy and we meet a marginal utility. To address this problem, model efficiency is improved successfully by introducing two effective strategies, multi-cardinality, and spatial attention, to image super-resolution from high-level vision tasks. We propose a novel and efficient architecture aggregated residual attention network (ARAN) and set a new state-of-the-art model efficiency. According to the multi-cardinality strategy, we use group convolutions in each basic module. Moreover, we apply spatial attention blocks as gate units to capture detailed information in input images, which can be the counterparts of their basic modules. Extra representation ability is demonstrated compared with both the same sized enhanced deep super-resolution network (EDSR) baseline model and currently the-state-of-the-art cascading residual network (CARN). The experiments suggest the effectiveness of these two missing strategies previously. Especially, in the aspect of model efficiency, ARAN exceeds almost all the medium sized models currently.

1157,"Erosion rates and weathering history of rock surfaces associated with Aboriginal rock art engravings (petroglyphs) on Burrup Peninsula, Western Australia, from cosmogenic nuclide measurements","Pillans, Brad; Fifield, L. Keith","The Burrup Peninsula and surrounding Dampier Archipelago, in Western Australia, contain the world's largest known gallery of rock art engravings (petroglyphs), estimated to number up to 1 million images. The peninsula is also the site of major industrial development and there are concerns that industrial emissions may adversely affect the stability and longevity of the rock art. We have studied the natural processes and rates of weathering and erosion, including the effects of fire, that affect the stability of rock surfaces and hence the longevity of the rock art, using cosmogenic nuclides. The concentration of Be-10 in quartz yields erosion rates in the range 0.15-0.48 mm/1000 years on horizontal rock surfaces and 0.34-2.30 mm/1000 years on vertical rock faces. The former, largely caused by mm-scale surface flaking, are amongst the lowest erosion rates measured by cosmogenic nuclides anywhere in the world. The latter are inferred to represent a combination of mm-scale flaking and very rare centimetre-to metre-scale block falls, controlled by failure along joint planes. Such low erosion rates result from a combination of resistant rocks, low relief and low rainfall, favouring long-term preservation of the petroglyphs - long enough to encompass the known period of human settlement in Australia.

Although the protective effects of scutellarein have been well studied, its influence on human reproduction remains unknown. In this research, we evaluated the effect of scutellarein on human sperm functions in vitro. Three different concentrations of scutellarein (1, 10, 100 μM) were applied to ejaculated human sperm. Fertilisation-essential functions, as well as the intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca2+ ]i ) and protein-tyrosine phosphorylation, two factors which are vital for sperm function regulation, were evaluated. The results demonstrated that all concentrations of scutellarein utilised in this study could significantly increase sperm spontaneous capacitation and acrosome reaction through the enhancement of [Ca2+ ]i . Besides, the level of tyrosine phosphorylation of sperm could also be increased by scutellarein. Meanwhile, the sperm motility could be improved by 10 and 100 μM scutellarein, which also make a significant enhancement in sperm penetration ability and hyperactivation. This is one of the limited studies showing the regulation of scutellarein on human spermatozoa functions and is helpful to enrich its application.",Chinese traditional medicine; human sperm function; scutellarein; tyrosine phosphorylation.
1160,Is Denoising Dead?,"Chatterjee, Priyam; Milanfar, Peyman","Image denoising has been a well studied problem in the field of image processing. Yet researchers continue to focus attention on it to better the current state-of-the-art. Recently proposed methods take different approaches to the problem and yet their denoising performances are comparable. A pertinent question then to ask is whether there is a theoretical limit to denoising performance and, more importantly, are we there yet? As camera manufacturers continue to pack increasing numbers of pixels per unit area, an increase in noise sensitivity manifests itself in the form of a noisier image. We study the performance bounds for the image denoising problem. Ourwork in this paper estimates a lower bound on the mean squared error of the denoised result and compares the performance of current state-of-the-art denoising methods with this bound. We show that despite the phenomenal recent progress in the quality of denoising algorithms, some room for improvement still remains for a wide class of general images, and at certain signal-to-noise levels. Therefore, image denoising is not dead-yet.",Bayesian Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB); bias; bootstrapping; image denoising; mean squared error

More attention was paid to this kind of imaging because of the shortage of MRI, EEG, and CSF findings. FDG-PET has been assessed in a few small studies and case reports showing apparent abnormalities in cases where MRI does not. Here, we summarized the patterns (specific or not) in AE with different antibodies detected and the clinical outlook for the wide application of FDG-PET considering some limitations. Specific patterns based on antibody subtypes and clinical symptoms were critical for identifying suspicious AE, the most common of which was the anteroposterior gradient in anti- N -methyl- d -aspartate receptor (NMDAR) encephalitis and the medial temporal lobe hypermetabolism in limbic encephalitis. And the dynamic changes of metabolic presentations in different phases provided us the potential to inspect the evolution of AE and predict the functional outcomes. Except for the visual assessment, quantitative analysis was recently reported in some voxel-based studies of regions of interest, which suggested some clues of the future evaluation of metabolic abnormalities. Large prospective studies need to be conducted controlling the time from symptom onset to examination with the same standard of FDG-PET scanning.",18F-FDG-PET; autoimmune encephalitis; neuroimaging patterns.
1162,ART FOR CHANGE: Transformative learning and youth empowerment in a changing climate,"Bentz, Julia; O'Brien, Karen","Young people represent a powerful force for social change, and they have an important role to play in climate change responses. However, empowering young people to be ""systems changers"" is not straightforward. It is particularly challenging within educational systems that prioritize instrumental learning over critical thinking and creative actions. History has shown that by creating novel spaces for reflexivity and experimentation, the arts have played a role in shifting mindsets and opening up new political horizons. In this paper, we explore the role of art as a driver for societal transformation in a changing climate and consider how an experiment with change can facilitate reflection on relationships between individual change and systems change. Following a review of the literature on transformations, transformative learning and the role of art, we describe an experiment with change carried out with students at an Art High School in Lisbon, Portugal, which involved choosing one sustainable behavior and adopting it for 30 days. A transformative program encouraged regular reflection and group discussions. During the experiment, students started developing an art project about his or her experience with change. The results show that a transformative learning approach that engages students with art can support critical thinking and climate change awareness, new perspectives and a sense of empowerment. Experiential, arts-based approaches also have the potential to create direct and indirect effects beyond the involved participants. We conclude that climate-related art projects can serve as more than a form of science communication. They represent a process of opening up imaginative spaces where audiences can move more freely and reconsider the role of humans as responsible beings with agency and a stake in sustainability transformations.",Climate change; Education; Transformative learning; Art; Adaptation; Transformation

The purpose of this study is to evaluate coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA)-based ESS in coronary arteries without atherosclerosis, and to assess factors affecting ESS values. CCTA images from patients with suspected coronary artery disease were analyzed to identify coronary arteries without atherosclerosis. Minimal and maximal ESS values were calculated for 3-mm segments. Factors potentially affecting ESS values were examined, including sex, lumen diameter and distance from the ostium. Segments were categorized according to lumen diameter tertiles into small (< 2.6 mm), intermediate (2.6-3.2 mm) or large (≥ 3.2 mm) segments. A total of 349 normal vessels from 168 patients (mean age 59 ± 9 years, 39% men) were included. ESS was highest in the left anterior descending artery compared to the left circumflex artery and right coronary artery (minimal ESS 2.3 Pa vs. 1.9 Pa vs. 1.6 Pa, p < 0.001 and maximal ESS 3.7 Pa vs. 3.0 Pa vs. 2.5 Pa, p < 0.001). Men had lower ESS values than women, also after adjusting for lumen diameter (p < 0.001). ESS values were highest in small segments compared to intermediate or large segments (minimal ESS 3.8 Pa vs. 1.7 Pa vs. 1.2 Pa, p < 0.001 and maximal ESS 6.0 Pa vs. 2.6 Pa vs. 2.0 Pa, p < 0.001). A weak to strong correlation was found between ESS and distance from the ostium (ρ = 0.22-0.62, p < 0.001). CCTA-based ESS values increase rapidly and become widely scattered with decreasing lumen diameter. This needs to be taken into account when assessing the added value of ESS beyond lumen diameter in highly stenotic lesions.",Atherosclerosis; Computational fluid dynamics; Coronary artery disease; Coronary computed tomography angiography; Endothelial wall shear stress.

Whole-genome sequencing approaches can improve such understanding by determining the origin of archaeological fish specimens that may have been obtained from historic trade or distant water. Here, we used genome-wide data to individually infer the biological source of 37 ancient Atlantic cod specimens (ca 1050-1950 CE) from England and Spain. Our findings provide novel genetic evidence that eleventh- to twelfth-century specimens from London were predominantly obtained from nearby populations, while thirteenth- to fourteenth-century specimens were derived from distant sources. Our results further suggest that Icelandic cod was indeed exported to London earlier than previously reported. Our observations confirm the chronology and geography of the trans-Atlantic cod trade from Newfoundland to Spain starting by the early sixteenth century. Our findings demonstrate the utility of whole-genome sequencing and ancient DNA approaches to describe the globalization of marine fisheries and increase our understanding regarding the extent of the North Atlantic fish trade and long-range fisheries in medieval and early modern times.",biological source; cod trade; genomics; historical ecology; marine fisheries; zooarchaeology.
1165,Alternating regimes of shallow and deep-sea diversification explain a species-richness paradox in marine fishes,"Elizabeth Christina Miller,Christopher M Martinez,Sarah T Friedman,Peter C Wainwright,Samantha A Price,Luke Tornabene,Elizabeth Christina Miller,Christopher M Martinez,Sarah T Friedman,Peter C Wainwright,Samantha A Price,Luke Tornabene","The deep sea contains a surprising diversity of life, including iconic fish groups such as anglerfishes and lanternfishes. Still, >65% of marine teleost fish species are restricted to the photic zone <200 m, which comprises less than 10% of the ocean's total volume. From a macroevolutionary perspective, this paradox may be explained by three hypotheses: 1) shallow water lineages have had more time to diversify than deep-sea lineages, 2) shallow water lineages have faster rates of speciation than deep-sea lineages, or 3) shallow-to-deep sea transition rates limit deep-sea richness. Here we use phylogenetic comparative methods to test among these three non-mutually exclusive hypotheses. While we found support for all hypotheses, the disparity in species richness is better described as the uneven outcome of alternating phases that favored shallow or deep diversification over the past 200 million y. Shallow marine teleosts became incredibly diverse 100 million y ago during a period of warm temperatures and high sea level, suggesting the importance of reefs and epicontinental settings. Conversely, deep-sea colonization and speciation was favored during brief episodes when cooling temperatures increased the efficiency of the ocean's carbon pump. Finally, time-variable ecological filters limited shallow-to-deep colonization for much of teleost history, which helped maintain higher shallow richness. A pelagic lifestyle and large jaws were associated with early deep-sea colonists, while a demersal lifestyle and a tapered body plan were typical of later colonists. Therefore, we also suggest that some hallmark characteristics of deep-sea fishes evolved prior to colonizing the deep sea.",coral reefs; deep sea; ecological filters; fishes; speciation rates.

In this study, the effects of sulfuretin, a major compound isolated from Rhus verniciflua Stokes, on osteoblast differentiation were investigated. Treatments of sulfuretin induced alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity in mesenchymal C3H10T1/2 cells and mineralization in preosteoblast MC3T3-E1 cells. Pro-osteogenic effects of sulfuretin were consistently observed in freshly isolated primary bone marrow cells. In mechanical studies, sulfuretin specifically induced expression of TGF-β target genes, such as SMAD7 and PAI-1, but not other signaling pathway-related genes. Similar to the results of gene expression analysis, reporter assays further demonstrated TGF-β-specific induction by sulfuretin. Furthermore, disruption of TGF-β signaling using treatment with TGF-β-specific inhibitor, SB-431542, and introduction of SMAD2/3 small interfering RNA impaired the effects of sulfuretin in inducing ALP activity and expression of ALP mRNA. Together, these data indicate that the pro-osteogenic effects of sulfuretin are mediated through activation of TGF-β signaling, further supporting the potential of sulfuretin in the prevention of bone-related diseases such as bone fracture and osteoporosis.",C3H10T1/2 cells; MC3T3-E1 cells; Osteoblast differentiation; Sulfuretin; TGF-beta.

HSI includes spectral and spatial information from several hundreds of spectral data channels. Recent CNN models deal with various bands of HSIs as independent channels, which may lead to the loss of dependencies between different channels or the loss of associated information between each channel and the global. This article proposes a novel CNN model based on geometric algebra (GA), dubbed GA-CNN, to process the HSIs in a holistic way without losing the interrelationship among channels. Specifically, taking advantage of GA, different band images are represented as GA multivectors to capture the inherent structures and preserve the correlation of those channels. In particular, all the basic modules of our model, such as convolutional layers and the backpropagation algorithm, are extended to the GA domain. We evaluate the performance of the proposed GA-CNN model in classification tasks on four well-known HSI datasets. The experimental results indicate that our GA-CNN model outperforms traditional and state-of-the-art real-valued CNNs with higher classification accuracy and fewer model parameters.",Convolutional neural networks; Biological neural networks; Feature extraction; Convolution; Algebra; Biological system modeling; Training; Convolutional neural network (CNN); geometric algebra (GA); hyperspectral images (HSIs) classification; multivectors

However, it poses new challenges, including low signal-to-noise ratio, interband misalignment, and high data dimensionality. Due to these challenges, the literature on hyperspectral face recognition is not only sparse but is limited to ad hoc dimensionality reduction techniques and lacks comprehensive evaluation. We propose a hyperspectral face recognition algorithm using a spatiospectral covariance for band fusion and partial least square regression for classification. Moreover, we extend 13 existing face recognition techniques, for the first time, to perform hyperspectral face recognition. We formulate hyperspectral face recognition as an image-set classification problem and evaluate the performance of seven state-of-the-art image-set classification techniques. We also test six state-of-the-art grayscale and RGB (color) face recognition algorithms after applying fusion techniques on hyperspectral images. Comparison with the 13 extended and five existing hyperspectral face recognition techniques on three standard data sets show that the proposed algorithm outperforms all by a significant margin. Finally, we perform band selection experiments to find the most discriminative bands in the visible and near infrared response spectrum.",Hyperspectral imaging; face recognition; image set classification

Although both tasks look quite similar, they differ with respect to the brain structures involved in the memory performance. The characterization of the memory performance in both tasks is important to understand treatment effects. Since there are no previous studies that compared strain differences in delay-dependent forgetting in both tasks, Wistar and Long Evans rats were tested in both the ORT and the OLT at different intervals. The data showed that in the ORT the delay-dependent forgetting was similar for Wistar and Long Evans rats. However, the forgetting curve was different for both strains in the OLT: the Long Evans rats the forgetting took a longer interval. This study indicates that delay-dependent forgetting in the ORT and OLT is strain and test dependent. It is suggested that before testing treatments the forgetting curve of a specific strain should be tested in this type of tasks.",Memory; Object recognition; Spatial; Strain differences.

It has been postulated that excessive accumulation of immunosuppressive myeloid cells influences immunotherapy resistance, and recent studies targeting macrophages in combination with checkpoint blockade have demonstrated promising preclinical results. Yet our understanding of tumor-associated macrophage (TAM) function, complexity, and diversity in PDA remains limited. Our analysis reveals significant macrophage heterogeneity, with bone marrow-derived monocytes serving as the primary source for immunosuppressive TAMs. These cells also serve as a primary source of TNF-α, which suppresses expression of the alarmin IL-33 in carcinoma cells. Deletion of Ccr2 in genetically engineered mice decreased monocyte recruitment, resulting in profoundly decreased TNF-α and increased IL-33 expression, decreased metastasis, and increased survival. Moreover, intervention studies targeting CCR2 with a new orthosteric inhibitor (CCX598) rendered PDA susceptible to checkpoint blockade, resulting in reduced metastatic burden and increased survival. Our data indicate that this shift in antitumor immunity is influenced by increased levels of IL-33, which increases dendritic cell and cytotoxic T cell activity. These data demonstrate that interventions to disrupt infiltration of immunosuppressive macrophages, or their signaling, have the potential to overcome barriers to effective immunotherapeutics for PDA.",Cancer immunotherapy; Cellular immune response; Gastric cancer; Oncology.

In this paper, we investigate a novel method of estimating uncertainty. We observe that, when assigned different misclassification costs in a certain degree, if the segmentation result of a pixel becomes inconsistent, this pixel shows a relative uncertainty in its segmentation. Therefore, we present a new semi-supervised segmentation model, namely, conservative-radical network (CoraNet in short) based on our uncertainty estimation and separate self-training strategy. In particular, our CoraNet model consists of three major components: a conservative-radical module (CRM), a certain region segmentation network (C-SN), and an uncertain region segmentation network (UC-SN) that could be alternatively trained in an end-to-end manner. We have extensively evaluated our method on various segmentation tasks with publicly available benchmark datasets, including CT pancreas, MR endocardium, and MR multi-structures segmentation on the ACDC dataset. Compared with the current state of the art, our CoraNet has demonstrated superior performance. In addition, we have also analyzed its connection with and difference from conventional methods of uncertainty estimation in semi-supervised medical image segmentation.",Uncertainty; Image segmentation; Estimation; Training; Biomedical imaging; Computational modeling; Task analysis; Semi-supervised segmentation; uncertainty estimation; conservative-radical networks
1177,A robust salient object detection using edge enhanced global topographical saliency,"Singh, Surya Kant; Srivastava, Rajeev","Complex salient object detection is the most challenging task in clutter background images. In this prevailing problem, global contrast-based methods are comprehensively preferred. But these methods fail in preserving the structure, shape and broader related geometrical information. Aiming at these limitations, the proposed method uses global contrast and iterative Laplacian of Gaussian to generate initial global topographical saliency. In this topographical saliency, iterative Laplacian of Gaussian is used to preserve the structural, shape and broader related geometrical information. This global topographical saliency is used as a reference plane for integrating regional saliencies. The color, spatial and distance based regional saliencies are integrated into the boundary enhanced global topographical saliency to improve the substantial information of the object. Boundary-based Gaussian weighted, background suppression model, is used to remove the background and edge-effects. Finally, central saliency addition is used to enhance the final saliency. The proposed method is compared with recent six global contrasts based state-of-art methods, two deep learning based methods and four publicly available datasets. The experimental result presented here shows that the proposed method performs better in comparison to the state-of-the-art methods.",Salient object detection; Laplacian of Gaussian; Central surround contrast; Global contrast; Regional saliency; Central saliency

Some mutants harboring substitutions to Asn in HBsAg MHR may have an additional potential N-glycosylation site. We have previously showed that sT123N substitution could generate additional N-glycosylated forms of HBsAg. In the present study, 1.3-fold-overlength HBV genomes containing the sT123N substitution were digested from the pHBV1.3-sT123N construct and subcloned into the pAAV vector to generate pAAV1.3-sT123N for hydrodynamic injection (HI) in mice. Viral expression and replication were phenotypically characterized by transient transfection. The results demonstrated that sT123N substitution impaired virion secretion, resulting in intracellular retention of HBcAg. Using the HBV HI mouse model, we found that mice mounted significantly stronger antibody responses to HBsAg and HBcAg, which accelerated HBsAg clearance. Thus, additional N-glycosylation generated by amino acid substitutions in HBsAg MHR may significantly modulate specific host immune responses and influence HBV infection in vivo. Our results help further the understanding of the role of immune escape mutants with N-linked glycosylation in the biology of HBV infection.",Hepatitis B virus; Immune escape mutants; Immune responses; N-glycosylation; Viral clearance.

Therefore, assessing climate change impacts, social and economic activities require proposed solutions to respond to climate change. This study aims to (i) apply the MIKE 11 model (Hydrodynamic module and Advection-Dispersion module) to simulate the impacts of climate change scenarios on water resources in Can Tho city; (ii) calculate water balance in Can Tho city; and (iii) suggest climate change adaptation plan for sustainable social-economic activities of the city. The results show that when the rainfall changes due to climate change, the flow rate tends to decrease at high tide and increase at low tide. When the sea level rises due to climate change, the flow rate tends to increase at high tide and decrease at low tide. For 2030, the flow will decrease up to 15.6% and 14.3% at the low tide period for RCP 2.6 and RCP 8.5 compared to the present, respectively. The flow will increase up to 63.5% and 58.9% at the high tide period for RCP 2.6 and RCP 8.5 compared to the present, respectively. The water demand evaluation shows that the water resource reserve in Can Tho city meets water demands in current and future scenarios under climate change. While rainwater and groundwater can provide enough water in the rainy season, the city has to use surface water during the dry season due to a lack of rainwater. Of these, agriculture contributes the most water demands (85%). Eight adaptation measures to climate change for Can Tho city are developed from 2021 to 2050.",Adaptation plan; Climate change; Mekong Delta; Water balance; Water flow.
1181,Performance estimation of the state-of-the-art convolution neural networks for thermal images-based gender classification system,"Farooq, Muhammad Ali; Javidnia, Hossein; Corcoran, Peter","Gender classification has found many useful applications in the broader domain of computer vision systems including in-cabin driver monitoring systems, human-computer interaction, video surveillance systems, crowd monitoring, data collection systems for the retail sector, and psychological analysis. In previous studies, researchers have established a gender classification system using visible spectrum images of the human face. However, there are many factors affecting the performance of these systems including illumination conditions, shadow, occlusions, and time of day. Our study is focused on evaluating the use of thermal imaging to overcome these challenges by providing a reliable means of gender classification. As thermal images lack some of the facial definition of other imaging modalities, a range of state-of-the-art deep neural networks are trained to perform the classification task. For our study, the Tufts University thermal facial image dataset was used for training. This features thermal facial images from more than 100 subjects gathered in multiple poses and multiple modalities and provided a good gender balance to support the classification task. These facial samples of both male and female subjects are used to fine-tune a number of selected state-of-the-art convolution neural networks (CNN) using transfer learning. The robustness of these networks is evaluated through cross validation on the Carl thermal dataset along with an additional set of test samples acquired in a controlled lab environment using prototype uncooled thermal cameras. Finally, a new CNN architecture, optimized for the gender classification task, GENNet, is designed and evaluated with the pretrained networks. (C) The Authors.

1182,Strategic Bidding for Producers in Nodal Electricity Markets: A Convex Relaxation Approach,"Ghamkhari, Mahdi; Sadeghi-Mobarakeh, Ashkan; Mohsenian-Rad, Hamed","Strategic bidding problems in electricity markets are widely studied in power systems, often by formulating complex bi-level optimization problems that are hard to solve. The state-of-the-art approach to solve such problems is to reformulate them as mixed-integer linear programs (MILPs). However, the computational time of such MILP reformulations grows dramatically, once the network size increases, scheduling horizon increases, or randomness is taken into consideration. In this paper, we take a fundamentally different approach and propose effective and customized convex programming tools to solve the strategic bidding problem for producers in nodal electricity markets. Our approach is inspired by the Schmudgen's Positivstellensatz Theorem in semi-algebraic geometry; but then we go through several steps based upon both convex optimization and mixed-integer programming that results in obtaining close to optimal bidding solutions, as evidenced by several numerical case studies, besides having a huge advantage on reducing computation time. While the computation time of the state-of-the-art MILP approach grows exponentially when we increase the scheduling horizon or the number of random scenarios, the computation time of our approach increases rather linearly.",Computation time; convex optimization; equilibrium constraints; nodal electricity market; strategic bidding
1183,Photo-Realistic Image Dehazing and Verifying Networks via Complementary Adversarial Learning,"Shin, Joongchol; Paik, Joonki","Physical model-based dehazing methods cannot, in general, avoid environmental variables and undesired artifacts such as non-collected illuminance, halo and saturation since it is difficult to accurately estimate the amount of the illuminance, light transmission and airlight. Furthermore, the haze model estimation process requires very high computational complexity. To solve this problem by directly estimating the radiance of the haze images, we present a novel dehazing and verifying network (DVNet). In the dehazing procedure, we enhanced the clean images by using a correction network (CNet), which uses the ground truth to learn the haze network. Haze images are then restored through a haze network (HNet). Furthermore, a verifying method verifies the error of both CNet and HNet using a self-supervised learning method. Finally, the proposed complementary adversarial learning method can produce results more naturally. Note that the proposed discriminator and generators (HNet & CNet) can be learned via an unpaired dataset. Overall, the proposed DVNet can generate a better dehazed result than state-of-the-art approaches under various hazy conditions. Experimental results show that the DVNet outperforms state-of-the-art dehazing methods in most cases.",dehazing; GAN; CNN

Herein, we propose a new environmental protection process for the efficient purification and removal of arsenic from wastewater by the formation of an AlAsO4@silicate core-shell structure based on the characteristics of aluminum-containing waste residue (AWR). At room temperature, the investigation with AWR almost achieved 100% As removal efficiency from wastewater, reducing the arsenic concentration from 5500 mg/L to 52 μg/L. With Al/As molar ratio of 3.5, the structural properties of AWR provided good adsorption sites for arsenic adsorption, leading to the formation of arsenate and insoluble aluminum arsenate with As. As-containing AWR silicate shells were produced under alkaline conditions, resulting in an arsenic leaching concentration of 1.32 mg/L in the TCLP test. AWR, as an efficient As removal and fixation agent, shows great potential in the treatment of copper smelting wastewater, and is expected to achieve large-scale industrial As removal.",Aluminum arsenate; Aluminum-containing waste residue; Arsenic removal; Wastewater.

When using the state-of-the-art motor drive-based techniques for extracting spatial information related to the state of wear in a gear train driven by an ac machine, position sensor-induced periodic position measurement errors and machine-induced spatial harmonic torque ripple can degrade the quality and the detail of the information that can be extracted. In this work, this degradation of information is displayed experimentally, and it is demonstrated that the quality of the spatial information extracted can be significantly improved through implementation of existing model reference adaptive system (MRAS)based nonideal sensor property decoupling techniques and newly developed MRAS-based spatial harmonic torque ripple decoupling techniques. Furthermore, it is identified and demonstrated in this work that by removing the gear mesh harmonic component from the gear wear information extracted using the state-of-the-art techniques, and then calculating the spatial rate of change of this new information, a new signal is generated that strongly correlates to local gear tooth defects in a gear train driven by an ac machine.",AC motor drives; fault diagnosis; gears; kinematics; model reference adaptive control; position measurement; torque control

It uses subpixel-precise image edges to track roughly rigid objects with high accuracy and is virtually drift-free even for long sequences. Furthermore, it is inherently capable of object re-detection when tracking fails. To evaluate the accuracy, robustness, and efficiency of the tracker precisely, we present a challenging new tracking dataset with pixel-precise ground truth. The precise ground-truth labels are created automatically from the photo-realistic synthetic VIPER dataset. The tracker is thoroughly evaluated against the state of the art through a number of qualitative and quantitative experiments. It is able to perform on par with the current state-of-the-art deep-learning trackers, but is at least 45 times faster, even without using a GPU. The efficiency and low memory consumption of the tracker are validated in further experiments that are conducted on an embedded device.",Visual object tracking; Real-time tracking; Shape model tracking

F.","Device-to-device (D2D) communication will allow direct transmission between nearby mobile devices in the next generation cellular networks. A fundamental problem in multi-hop D2D networks is the design of forwarding algorithms that achieve, at the same time, high delivery ratio and low network overhead. In this work, we study group meetings' properties by looking at their structure and regularity with the goal of applying such knowledge in the design of a forwarding algorithm for D2D multi-hop networks. We introduce a forwarding protocol, namely GROUPS-NET, which is aware of social group meetings and their evolution over time. Our algorithm is parameter-calibration free and does not require any knowledge about the social network structure of the system. In particular, different from the state of the art algorithms, GROUPS-NET does not need communities' detection, which is a complex and expensive task. We validate our algorithm by using different publicly available data sources. In real-world large scale scenarios, our algorithm achieves approximately the same delivery ratio of the state-of-the-art solution with 40% less network overhead. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Communicating the functional interactions between geometric features in existing patented designs may increase a designer's awareness of the prior art and thereby avoid conflict with their emerging design. This paper shows how functional representations of geometry interactions can be developed from patent claims to produce novel semantic graphical and text annotations of patent drawings. The approach provides a quick and accurate means for the designer to understand the patent that is well suited to the designer's natural way of understanding the device. Through several example application cases we show the application of a detailed representation of functional geometry interactions that captures the working principle of familiar mechanical engineering devices described in patents. A computer tool that is being developed to assist the designer to understand prior art is also described.,Function analysis diagram; Functional interactions; Functional representation; Geometric features; Prior art; Semantics; Working principle

By analogy with classical slotted ALOHA, state-of-the-art models LTE RA as a multichannel slotted ALOHA. In this letter, we direct the attention to the resource consumption of RA. We show that the consumption is a random variable dependent on the contention parameters. We consider two approaches to include the consumption into RA optimization: by defining resource efficiency and by the means of a bi-objective optimization, where resource consumption and throughput are the competing objectives. We then develop the algorithm to obtain Pareto-optimal RA configuration under resource constraint.

In this paper, we revisit these features from a functional approximation perspective. In particular, we view an image as a 2-D functional and investigate its Taylor series approximation. Differential features are derived from the approximation coefficients and, therefore, are naturally collected for appearance representation. Thus motivated, we propose to use the zeroth-, first-, and second-order differential features for pedestrian detection and call such features Taylor feature transform (TAFT). In practice, the TAFT features are computed by discrete sampling to address scale issues and meanwhile achieve computational efficiency. In addition, orientation insensitivity is handled by using directional versions of differentials. When applied to pedestrian detection, the TAFT is sampled on grid pixels and calculated from multiple channels following previous solutions. In our extensive experiments on the INRIA, Caltech, TUD-Brussel, and KITTI data sets, the TAFT achieves state-of-the-art results. It outperforms all handcrafted features and performs on par with many deep-learning solutions. Moreover, when a low false-positive rate is requested, the TAFT generates results that are better than or comparable to the state-of-the-art deep learning-based methods. Meanwhile, our implementation runs at 33 fps for 640x480 images without GPU, making TAFT favorable in many practical scenarios.",Pedestrian detection; Taylor feature transform; integral channel feature

However, many other relevant applications of DL, especially at the edge, are based on time-series processing and require models with unique features, for which NAS is less explored. This work focuses in particular on Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCNs), a convolutional model for time-series processing that has recently emerged as a promising alternative to more complex recurrent architectures. We propose the first NAS tool that explicitly targets the optimization of the most peculiar architectural parameters of TCNs, namely dilation, receptive-field and number of features in each layer. The proposed approach searches for networks that offer good trade-offs between accuracy and number of parameters/operations, enabling an efficient deployment on embedded platforms. Moreover, its fundamental feature is that of being lightweight in terms of search complexity, making it usable even with limited hardware resources. We test the proposed NAS on four real-world, edge-relevant tasks, involving audio and bio-signals: (i) PPG-based Heart-Rate Monitoring, (ii) ECG-based Arrythmia Detection, (iii) sEMG-based Hand-Gesture Recognition, and (iv) Keyword Spotting. Results show that, starting from a single seed network, our method is capable of obtaining a rich collection of Pareto optimal architectures, among which we obtain models with the same accuracy as the seed, and 15.9-152x fewer parameters. Moreover, the NAS finds solutions that Pareto-dominate state-of-the-art hand-tuned models for 3 out of the 4 benchmarks, and are Pareto-optimal on the fourth (sEMG). Compared to three state-of-the-art NAS tools, ProxylessNAS, MorphNet and FBNetV2, our method explores a larger search space for TCNs (up to 10(12)x) and obtains superior solutions, while requiring low GPU memory and search time. We deploy our NAS outputs on two distinct edge devices, the multicore GreenWaves Technology GAP8 IoT processor and the single-core STMicroelectronics STM32H7 microcontroller.

1197,Differential Evolutionary Superpixel Segmentation,"Gong, Yue-Jiao; Zhou, Yicong","Superpixel segmentation has been of increasing importance in many computer vision applications recently. To handle the problem, most state-of-the-art algorithms either adopt a local color variance model or a local optimization algorithm. This paper develops a new approach, named differential evolutionary superpixels, which is able to optimize the global properties of segmentation by means of a global optimizer. We design a comprehensive objective function aggregating within-superpixel error, boundary gradient, and a regularization term. Minimizing the within-superpixel error enforces the homogeneity of superpixels. In addition, the introduction of boundary gradient drives the superpixel boundaries to capture the natural image boundaries, so as to make each superpixel overlaps with a single object. The regularizer further encourages producing similarly sized superpixels that are friendly to human vision. The optimization is then accomplished by a powerful global optimizer-differential evolution. The algorithm constantly evolves the superpixels by mimicking the process of natural evolution, while using a linear complexity to the image size. Experimental results and comparisons with eleven state-of-the-art peer algorithms verify the promising performance of our algorithm.",Superpixel segmentation; differential evolution; seeding; preprocessing; clustering

This method remolds the task of segmentation as a problem of cross-modality data transformation from retinal image to vessel map. A wide and deep neural network with strong induction ability is proposed to model the transformation, and an efficient training strategy is presented. Instead of a single label of the center pixel, the network can output the label map of all pixels for a given image patch. Our approach outperforms reported state-of-the-art methods in terms of sensitivity, specificity and accuracy. The result of cross-training evaluation indicates its robustness to the training set. The approach needs no artificially designed feature and no preprocessing step, reducing the impact of subjective factors. The proposed method has the potential for application in image diagnosis of ophthalmologic diseases, and it may provide a new, general, high-performance computing framework for image segmentation.",Cross-modality learning; deep learning; retinal image; vessel segmentation

Theoretical considerations and experimental evidence suggest that prion propagation is modulated by cell-autonomous and non-autonomous modifiers.

While 1,151 modified the expression of both the pathological prion protein, PrPSc , and its cellular counterpart, PrPC , 40 genes selectively affected PrPSc . Of the latter 40 genes, 20 augmented prion production when suppressed. A prominent limiter of prion propagation was the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein Hnrnpk. Psammaplysene A (PSA), which binds Hnrnpk, reduced prion levels in cultured cells and protected them from cytotoxicity. PSA also reduced prion levels in infected cerebellar organotypic slices and alleviated locomotor deficits in prion-infected Drosophila melanogaster expressing ovine PrPC . Hence, genome-wide QUIPPER-based perturbations can discover actionable cellular pathways involved in prion propagation. Further, the unexpected identification of a prion-controlling ribonucleoprotein suggests a role for RNA in the generation of infectious prions.",High-throughput screen; Hnrnpk; Neurodegeneration; Prion; Protein aggregation.
1201,Data model for additive manufacturing digital thread: state of the art and perspectives,"Bonnard, Renan; Hascoet, Jean-Yves; Mognol, Pascal","Additive Manufacturing (AM) is currently seen as an interesting process for the fabrication of complex and high value-added functional products. AM is being increasingly used in manufacturing bringing forward technological advancements particularly in materials and process optimisations. Simultaneously, the lifecycle of manufactured products is increasingly based on an 'all-digital' context using cyber-physical systems, the Internet of Things and Industry 4.0 devices. This has led to huge amounts of digital data being generated in manufacturing projects development. Data management is one of the key issues for diffusing and adopting this technology. However, the commonly used digital thread for AM is based on old solutions, such as STL and G-code, which were developed during the 1980s and are not well synchronised with current advanced developments in AM. Moreover, digital thread needs to be contextualised according to the complexities of the sector in which it is being used. Hence, alternative formats should also take into account global and sectorial application. This paper presents the past and current research for a state-of-the-art data model digital thread, as well as perspectives and recommendations for a performing data model thread adapted to the different needs of the AM community.",Additive manufacturing; Industry 4; 0; CAD-CAM-CAPP-CNC; digital thread; digital chain; rapid prototyping; 3D printing

Studies in adults provide a rich source of data to inform the paediatric investigation plans, including knowledge on drug pharmacokinetics (PK), safety and efficacy. In children, drug disposition differs widely from birth to adolescence but extrapolating adult to paediatric PK, safety and efficacy either with pharmacometric or physiologically based approaches can help design or in some cases reduce the need for clinical studies. Aspects to consider when extrapolating PK include the maturation of drug metabolizing enzyme expression, glomerular filtration, drug excretory systems, and the expression and activity of specific transporters in conjunction with other drug properties such as fraction unbound. Knowledge of these can be used to develop extrapolation tools such as allometric scaling plus maturation functions or physiologically based PK. PK/pharmacodynamic approaches and well-designed clinical trials in children are of key importance in paediatric drug development. In this white paper, state-of-the-art of current methods used for paediatric extrapolation will be discussed. This paper is part of a conect4children implementation of innovative methodologies including pharmacometric and physiologically based PK modelling in clinical trial design/paediatric drug development through dissemination of expertise and expert advice.

We introduce this mismatch by enrolling client models on high quality biometric samples obtained on a laptop computer and authenticating them on lower quality biometric samples acquired with a mobile phone. To perform these experiments we develop three novel authentication protocols for the large publicly available MOBIO database. We evaluate state-of-the-art face, speaker and bi-modal authentication techniques and show that inter-session variability modelling using Gaussian mixture models provides a consistently robust system for face, speaker and bi-modal authentication. It is also shown that multi-algorithm fusion provides a consistent performance improvement for face, speaker and bi-modal authentication. Using this bi-modal multi-algorithm system we derive a state-of-the-art authentication system that obtains a half total error rate of 63% and 1.9% for Female and Male trials, respectively.

However, traditional state-of-the-art SLAM approaches are typically designed under the static-world assumption and prone to be degraded by moving objects when running in dynamic scenes. This article presents a novel semantic visual-inertial SLAM system for dynamic environments that, building on VINS-Mono, performs real-time trajectory estimation by utilizing the pixel-wise results of semantic segmentation. We integrate the feature tracking and extraction framework into the front-end of the SLAM system, which could make full use of the time waiting for the completion of the semantic segmentation module, to effectively track the feature points on subsequent images from the camera. In this way, the system can track feature points stably even in high-speed movement. We also construct the dynamic feature detection module that combines the pixel-wise semantic segmentation results and the multi-view geometric constraints to exclude dynamic feature points. We evaluate our system in public datasets, including dynamic indoor scenes and outdoor scenes. Several experiments demonstrate that our system could achieve higher localization accuracy and robustness than state-of-the-art SLAM systems in challenging environments.",Simultaneous localization and mapping; dynamic environment; semantic; visual-inertial system

Recently, the deep learning framework has been hugely successful in different computer vision applications like object detection, image classification, event detection, etc. Some recent deep learning-based works also show promising results for image steganalysis and have opened a new avenue for research. The current literature reveals that the steganalytic detector becomes more precise if trained on the residual error (embedding noise) domain. To get an accurate noise residual, it is required to predict the cover image precisely from the corresponding stego image. In this work, a denoising kernel has been learned to obtain a more precise noise residual. After that, a CNN based steganalytic detector is devised, which is trained using the noise residual to get a more precise detection. Experimental results show that the proposed scheme outperforms the state-of-the-art steganalysis schemes against the state-of-the-art steganographic approaches.",Steganalysis; Spatial domain steganalysis; Denoising kernels

Based on deep neural networks, previous studies have shown promising technologies for brain glioma segmentation. However, these approaches lack powerful strategies to incorporate contextual information of tumor cells and their surrounding, which has been proven as a fundamental cue to deal with local ambiguity. In this work, we propose a novel approach named Context-Aware Network (CANet) for brain glioma segmentation. CANet captures high dimensional and discriminative features with contexts from both the convolutional space and feature interaction graphs. We further propose context guided attentive conditional random fields which can selectively aggregate features. We evaluate our method using publicly accessible brain glioma segmentation datasets BRATS2017, BRATS2018 and BRATS2019.

Whether S1 and pIC are nodes in anatomically separate or overlapping thermal sensorimotor pathways is unclear, as the brain-wide connectivity of the thermal system has not been mapped. We address this using functionally targeted, dual injections of anterograde viruses or retrograde tracers into the forelimb representation of S1 (fS1) and pIC (fpIC). Our data show that inputs to fS1 and fpIC originate from separate neuronal populations, supporting the existence of parallel input pathways. Outputs from fS1 and fpIC are more widespread than their inputs, sharing a number of cortical and subcortical targets. While, axonal projections were separable, they were more overlapping than the clusters of input cells. In both fS1 and fpIC circuits, there was a high degree of reciprocal connectivity with thalamic and cortical regions, but unidirectional output to the midbrain and hindbrain. Notably, fpIC showed connectivity with regions associated with thermal processing. Together, these data indicate that cutaneous thermal information is routed to the cortex via parallel circuits and is forwarded to overlapping downstream regions for the binding of somatosensory percepts and integration with ongoing behavior.",parallel pathways; posterior insular cortex; primary somatosensory cortex; thermosensation; whole-brain connectivity.

We propose a fully automated method to segment and quantify coronary calcification in intravascular OCT (IVOCT) images based on convolutional neural networks (CNN). All possible calcified plaques were segmented from IVOCT pullbacks using a spatial-temporal encoder-decoder network by exploiting the 3D continuity information of the plaques, which were then screened and classified by a DenseNet network to reduce false positives. A novel data augmentation method based on the IVOCT image acquisition pattern was also proposed to improve the performance and robustness of the segmentation. Clinically relevant metrics including calcification area, depth, angle, thickness, volume, and stent-deployment calcification score, were automatically computed. 13844 IVOCT images with 2627 calcification slices from 45 clinical OCT pullbacks were collected and used to train and test the model. The proposed method performed significantly better than existing state-of-the-art 2D and 3D CNN methods. The data augmentation method improved the Dice similarity coefficient for calcification segmentation from 0.615 +/- 0.332 to 0.756 +/- 0.222, reaching human-level inter-observer agreement. Our proposed region-based classifier improved image-level calcification classification precision and F1-score from 0.725 +/- 0.071 and 0.791 +/- 0.041 to 0.964 +/- 0.002 and 0.883 +/- 0.008, respectively. Bland-Altman analysis showed close agreement between manual and automatic calcification measurements.

1210,Boundary-Weighted Domain Adaptive Neural Network for Prostate MR Image Segmentation,"Zhu, Qikui; Du, Bo; Yan, Pingkun","Accurate segmentation of the prostate from magnetic resonance (MR) images provides useful information for prostate cancer diagnosis and treatment. However, automated prostate segmentation from 3D MR images faces several challenges. The lack of clear edge between the prostate and other anatomical structures makes it challenging to accurately extract the boundaries. The complex background texture and large variation in size, shape and intensity distribution of the prostate itself make segmentation even further complicated. Recently, as deep learning, especially convolutional neural networks (CNNs), emerging as the best performed methods for medical image segmentation, the difficulty in obtaining large number of annotated medical images for training CNNs has become much more pronounced than ever. Since large-scale dataset is one of the critical components for the success of deep learning, lack of sufficient training data makes it difficult to fully train complex CNNs. To tackle the above challenges, in this paper, we propose a boundary-weighted domain adaptive neural network (BOWDA-Net). To make the network more sensitive to the boundaries during segmentation, a boundary-weighted segmentation loss is proposed. Furthermore, an advanced boundary-weighted transfer leaning approach is introduced to address the problem of small medical imaging datasets. We evaluate our proposed model on three different MR prostate datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model is more sensitive to object boundaries and outperformed other state-of-the-art methods.",Image segmentation; prostate MR image; domain adaptation; convolutional neural network; boundary-weighted loss

Existing deep learning (DL)-based methods for MR reconstruction employ deep networks to exploit the prior information and integrate the prior knowledge into the reconstruction under the explicit constraint of data consistency, without considering the real distribution of the noise. In this work, we propose a new DL-based approach termed Learned DC that implicitly learns the data consistency with deep networks, corresponding to the actual probability distribution of system noise. The data consistency term and the prior knowledge are both embedded in the weights of the networks, which provides an utterly implicit manner of learning reconstruction model. We evaluated the proposed approach with highly undersampled dynamic data, including the dynamic cardiac cine data with up to 24-fold acceleration and dynamic rectum data with the acceleration factor equal to the number of phases. Experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of the Learned DC both quantitatively and qualitatively than the state-of-the-art.",Image reconstruction; Imaging; Magnetic resonance imaging; Data models; Training; Deep learning; Supervised learning; MR reconstruction; deep learning; learned data consistency; dynamic magnetic resonance imaging

Here, the emergence of non-linear electromechanical responses in piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM) is explored. Non-linear responses in PFM can originate from multiple mechanisms, including intrinsic material responses often controlled by domain structure, surface topography that affects the mechanical phenomena at the tip-surface junction, and the presence of surface contaminants. Using an automated experiment to probe the origins of non-linear behavior in ferroelectric lead titanate (PTO) and ferroelectric Al0.93 B0.07 N films, it is found that PTO shows asymmetric nonlinear behavior across a/c domain walls and a broadened high nonlinear response region around c/c domain walls. In contrast, for Al0.93 B0.07 N, well-poled regions show high linear piezoelectric responses, when paired with low non-linear responses regions that are multidomain show low linear responses and high nonlinear responses. It is shown that formulating dissimilar exploration strategies in deep kernel learning as alternative hypotheses allows for establishing the preponderant physical mechanisms behind the non-linear behaviors, suggesting that automated experiments can potentially discern between competing physical mechanisms. This technique can also be extended to electron, probe, and chemical imaging.",automated experiments; ferroelectrics; machine learning; non-linearity; piezoresponse force microscopy.
1213,VCSR: An Efficient GPU Memory-Aware Sparse Format,"Karimi, Elmira; Agostini, Nicolas Bohm; Dong, Shi; Kaeli, David","The Sparse Matrix-Vector Multiplication (SpMV) kernel is used in a broad class of linear algebra computations. SpMV computations result in a performance bottleneck in many high performance applications, so optimizing SpMV performance is paramount. While implementing this kernel on a GPU can potentially boost performance significantly, current GPU libraries either provide modest performance gains or are burdened with high sparse format conversion overhead. In this paper we introduce the Vertical Compressed Sparse Row (VCSR) format, a novel memory-aware format that out-performs previous proposed formats on a GPU. We first motivate the design of our baseline VCSR format and then step through a series of enhancements that further improve VCSR's memory efficiency (VCSR-MEM) and performance (VCSR-INTRLV), while also considering conversion overhead. VCSR attempts to produce a high degree of thread-level parallelism and memory utilization by exploiting knowledge of GPU memory microarchitecture. VCSR can reduce the number of global memory transactions significantly, an issue not addressed by most other sparse formats. In addition, VCSR provides a novel reordering mechanism. It minimizes the size of the compressed matrix, handles both regular/irregular sparse matrices, and can be customized based on matrix size. VCSR also minimizes conversion overhead, as compared to full or partial row reordering. Our methodology is highly configurable and can be optimized for any sparse matrix. We have evaluated the VCSR format for the SpMV kernel when run on two different NVIDIA GPUs, the Kepler K40 and the Volta V100. We compare VCSR with NVIDIA's cuSPARSE library (the HYB format), a state-of-the-art sparse library. We also compare against other state-of-the-art CSR-based formats, including CSR5, merge-base SpMV and HOLA. We evaluate the benefits of VCSR over the entire University of Florida's SuiteSparse dataset collection. The VCSR-baseline format achieves an average speedup ranging from 1.10 x to 1.39x when compared to the performance of the four state-of-the-art formats on an NVIDIA V100. While the VCSR-MEM format can save a significant amount of memory space, it is a bit slower than our VCSR-baseline. VCSR-INTRLV performs much better than the VCSR-baseline, and even when including the conversion overhead, achieves an average speedup of 1.08 x as compared to HOLA (the best performing format among the prior schemes).",GPU; memory patterns; SpMV; sparse matrices
1214,Detailed Feature Guided Generative Adversarial Pose Reconstruction Network,"Hao, Jinlin; Chen, Xueyun","Face frontalization is a critical and difficult task on face pose reconstruction. Previous researches use simple posture information as guidance, such as pose coding and facial landmarks. To explore the guidance effect of profile faces, we propose detailed features that provide much detailed information. In this paper, a Detailed Feature Guided Generative Adversarial Pose Reconstruction Network (DGPR) is proposed. Firstly, frontal pose coding and profile detailed features are fed into DGPR to generate detailed features of front face. Then, the second generator combines frontal detailed features and profile face to reconstruct front face. Besides, we propose a conditional enhancement loss to strengthen the guiding role of detailed features, and a smoothing loss to reduce edge sharpness in generated faces. Experimental results show that our method generates photorealistic front faces and outperforms state-of-the-art methods on M(2)FPA and CAS-PEAL. Specifically, DGPR improves the face recognition accuracy under pose angles of +/- 60 degrees, +/- 75 degrees, +/- 90 degrees by 2%, 1%, and 6% respectively over the state-of-the-art methods on M(2)FPA, achieves the average rank-1 recognition rate to 99.95% and improves it by 0.05% on CAS-PEAL.

Layer stacking and geometric structures are expected to significantly affect the conductivity and permittivity of MXenes. However, it is still a formidable task to simultaneously regulate layer stacking and microstructure of MXenes to realize high-performance EMW absorption. Herein, a simple and viable strategy using electrostatic adsorption is developed to integrate 2D Ti3 C2 Tx MXene nanosheets into 3D hollow bowl-like structures with tunable layer stacking thickness. Density functional theory calculations indicate an increase in the density of states of the d orbital from the Ti atom near the Fermi level and the generation of additional electrical dipoles in the MXene nanosheets constituting the bowl walls upon reducing the layer stacking thickness. The hollow MXene bowls exhibit a minimum reflection loss (RLmin ) of -53.8 dB at 1.8 mm. The specific absorbing performance, defined as RLmin (dB)/thickness (mm)/filler loading (wt%), exceeds 598 dB mm-1 , far surpassing that of the most current MXene and bowl-like materials reported in the literature.

1216,Modified U-Net (mU-Net) With Incorporation of Object-Dependent High Level Features for Improved Liver and Liver-Tumor Segmentation in CT Images,"Seo, Hyunseok; Huang, Charles; Bassenne, Maxime; Xiao, Ruoxiu; Xing, Lei","Segmentation of livers and liver tumors is one of the most important steps in radiation therapy of hepatocellular carcinoma. The segmentation task is often done manually, making it tedious, labor intensive, and subject to intra-/inter- operator variations. While various algorithms for delineating organ-at-risks (OARs) and tumor targets have been proposed, automatic segmentation of livers and liver tumors remains intractable due to their low tissue contrast with respect to the surrounding organs and their deformable shape in CT images. The U-Net has gained increasing popularity recently for image analysis tasks and has shown promising results. Conventional U-Net architectures, however, suffer from three major drawbacks. First, skip connections allow for the duplicated transfer of low resolution information in feature maps to improve efficiency in learning, but this often leads to blurring of extracted image features. Secondly, high level features extracted by the network often do not contain enough high resolution edge information of the input, leading to greater uncertainty where high resolution edge dominantly affects the network's decisions such as liver and liver-tumor segmentation. Thirdly, it is generally difficult to optimize the number of pooling operations in order to extract high level global features, since the number of pooling operations used depends on the object size. To cope with these problems, we added a residual path with deconvolution and activation operations to the skip connection of the U-Net to avoid duplication of low resolution information of features. In the case of small object inputs, features in the skip connection are not incorporated with features in the residual path. Furthermore, the proposed architecture has additional convolution layers in the skip connection in order to extract high level global features of small object inputs as well as high level features of high resolution edge information of large object inputs. Efficacy of the modified U-Net (mU-Net) was demonstrated using the public dataset of Liver tumor segmentation (LiTS) challenge 2017. For liver-tumor segmentation, Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) of 89.72 %, volume of error (VOE) of 21.93 %, and relative volume difference (RVD) of - 0.49 % were obtained. For liver segmentation, DSC of 98.51 %, VOE of 3.07 %, and RVD of 0.26 % were calculated. For the public 3D Image Reconstruction for Comparison of Algorithm Database (3Dircadb), DSCs were 96.01 % for the liver and 68.14 % for liver-tumor segmentations, respectively.

However, the changes in clouds including expansion, dissipation, and distortion are extremely complex, which exacerbates the difficulty of forecasting. Fortunately, it still follows certain meteorological laws, which can be explored based on spatiotemporal information but are not fully considered by previous models. In this article, we design two modules to focus on these messages based on atmospheric characteristics. Specifically, the spatial local attention memory (SLAM) module combines local attention and memory mechanism to capture the meteorological spatial relationship, while the time difference memory (TDM) module combines differential technology and memory mechanism to capture the meteorological temporal variants. We combine these two modules with PredRNN and propose PrecipLSTM to sufficiently capture the spatiotemporal dependencies of radar data.

We propose a novel deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based model that treats immunohistochemical (IHC) scoring of HER2 as a sequential learning task. For a given image tile sampled from multi-resolution giga-pixel whole slide image (WSI), the model learns to sequentially identify some of the diagnostically relevant regions of interest (ROIs) by following a parameterized policy. The selected ROIs are processed by recurrent and residual convolution networks to learn the discriminative features for different HER2 scores and predict the next location, without requiring to process all the sub-image patches of a given tile for predicting the HER2 score, mimicking the histopathologist who would not usually analyze every part of the slide at the highest magnification. The proposed model incorporates a task-specific regularization term and inhibition of return mechanism to prevent the model from revisiting the previously attended locations. We evaluated our model on two IHC datasets: a publicly available dataset from the HER2 scoring challenge contest and another dataset consisting of WSIs of gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumor sections stained with Glo1 marker. We demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms other methods based on state-of-the-art deep convolutional networks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study using DRL for IHC scoring and could potentially lead to wider use of DRL in the domain of computational pathology reducing the computational burden of the analysis of large multi-gigapixel histology images.",Predictive models; Task analysis; Tumors; Computational modeling; Pathology; Breast; Training; Deep reinforcement learning; computational pathology; immunohistochemical scoring; breast cancer

Additionally, it combines multi-scale features obtained from the waterfall flow with the person-detection capability of the disentangled adaptive regression and incorporates adaptive convolutions to infer keypoints more precisely in crowded scenes. Full-BAPose achieves state-of-the art performance on the challenging CrowdPose and COCO-WholeBody datasets, with AP of 72.2% and 68.4%, respectively, based on 133 keypoints. Our results demonstrate that Full-BAPose is efficient and robust when operating under a variety conditions, including multiple people, changes in scale, and occlusions.",human pose estimation; whole-body pose estimation; deep learning; multi-scale representations; waterfall module; atrous spatial pooling; adaptive convolutions; disentangled keypoint regression
1223,Digital Twin for Urban Planning in the Green Deal Era: A State of the Art and Future Perspectives,"Caprari, Giorgio; Castelli, Giordana; Montuori, Marco; Camardelli, Marialucia; Malvezzi, Roberto","This paper provides a state of the art of contemporary Digital Twins (DTs) projects for urban planning at an international level. The contribution investigates the evolution of the DT concept and contextualises this tool within the scientific-cultural debate, highlighting the interconnection between global policies and local needs/wishes. Specifically, six case studies of DTs are compared, illustrating their application, content, technological infrastructure, and priority results. The projects presented provide an overview of the existing DT typologies, focusing on the evaluative/prefigurative use and the limits/potential of the tool in light of the socio-health, climate, and environmental crises. Reflections on DT reveal, on the one hand, its potential role in supporting decision-making and participatory processes and, on the other, the potential utopian trend of data-driven planning encouraged by public-private investments in the smart city/twin city sector. In conclusion, the study underlines the innovative role of DT as a cutting-edge scientific format in the disciplinary framework but highlights that the practical use of the tool is still in an experimental research-action phase. From this theoretical-critical review, it is possible to hypothesise new research paths to implement the realism and application potential of DTs for urban planning and urban governance.",digital twin; urban planning; urban governance; tools and techniques; geospatial technologies; climate action

Dapivirine (DPV) is a nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor which has been demonstrated to be well-tolerated and efficacious in multiple clinical trials when used in a vaginal ring formulation. DPV gel administered rectally with an applicator was found to be well-tolerated in a phase 1 clinical trial. MTN-033, a single site, open label, sequence randomized, crossover study, enrolled HIV-negative men to receive 0.05% DPV gel intrarectally using an applicator (2.5 g) and self-administered on an artificial phallus as lubricant (up to 10 g). The study evaluated the pharmacokinetics (in plasma, rectal fluid, and mucosal rectal tissue), safety, acceptability, and pharmacodynamics of DPV gel when applied rectally. Statistical comparisons between methods of application were performed using mixed effects models or Wilcoxon's signed rank tests. Sixteen participants used DPV gel by applicator and 15/16 participants used gel as lubricant (mean, 1.8 g; SD, 0.8). DPV plasma AUC0-24h after use as lubricant was estimated to be 0.41 times the AUC0-24h (95% CI 0.24, 0.88) after use with applicator. While DPV was quantifiable in plasma and luminal fluid, it was not quantifiable in tissue for both applicator and as lubricant administration. No related adverse events (AE) were reported, and 15/15 participants felt the gel was easy to use. Evidence of local delivery and systemic absorption of DPV when dosed as an anal lubricant supports the feasibility and potential for development of lubricant-delivered rectal microbicides. There were no safety concerns associated with use of DPV gel and participants reported finding it easy to use. However, lower DPV exposure in plasma and lack of quantifiable DPV in rectal tissue indicate that higher potency, concentration, and longer half-life antiretrovirals with optimized formulations will be needed to achieve protective tissue concentrations.",HIV prevention; behavioral congruence; lubricant; microbicide; microbicides; on demand; pharmacokinetic; rectal.

Fanconi anemia complementation group D2 (FANCD2) is the core component of the Fanconi anemia repair pathway. To explore the function of FANCD2 in EC, we examined the expression of FANCD2 in human specimens and databases, and discussed the possible mechanism of carcinogenesis by in vitro assays. Immunohistochemistry results showed overexpression of FANCD2 was detected in EC tissues compared to normal and atypical hyperplasia endometrium. Higher FANCD2 expression was correlated with deeper myometrial invasion (MI) and proficient mismatch repair status. The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database analysis showed FANCD2 was upregulated in EC compared with normal tissue. The high expression of FANCD2 was associated with poor overall survival in EC. Knockdown of FANCD2 expression in EC cell lines inhibited malignant proliferation and migration ability. We demonstrated that decreased FANCD2 expression results in increased DNA damage and decreased S-phase cells, leading to a decrease in proliferative capacity in EC cells. Down-regulated FANCD2 confers sensitivity of EC cells to interstrand crosslinking agents. This study provides evidence for the malignant progression and prognostic value of FANCD2 in EC.",Cell cycle; Chemotherapy sensitivity; DNA damage repair; Endometrial cancer; FANCD2; Proliferation.

1229,Optimizing bend loss in optical waveguide channel routing on photonic integrated circuits,"Sharma, Sumit; Roy, Sudip","Silicon photonics (Si-photonics) has been established as a potential technology that integrates both electronic and optical circuits on single integrated circuits (ICs) in order to satisfy the increasing demand for high speed and low power in the emerging market of ICs. It has opened up the research directions in the domain of design automation for photonic ICs. On the physical layout of the optical circuits, it is a challenging task to obtain the optimal routing of optical waveguides, while minimizing all the parameters like the number of tracks, total bend loss, worst signal loss, total propagation loss and total crossing loss. In this paper, we proposed two non-Manhattan grid-based methods for reducing the bend loss, worst signal loss and tracks in optical channel routing. First, a 0-1 integer linear programming-based algorithm called minimizing bend loss (MBL) is proposed, which minimizes the total bend loss (TBL) and the worst signal loss (WSL) while reducing the number of tracks (T) over the state-of-the-art technique. The execution time of MBL is very high for the large input. Hence next, a scalable heuristic called reducing bend loss (RBL) is presented that provides a better balance between the reduction of the TBL and T over the state-of-the-art and MBL algorithms. Simulation results show that MBL can reduce the TBL and the WSL by an average of 57.9% and 63.1%, respectively, with an average increase of 12% in T over state-of-the-art algorithms. The simulation results show that the RBL reduces the TBL and the WSL by an average of 39.7% and 41.3%, respectively, with an average increase of 23.7% in T over state-of-the-art algorithms.",Channel routing; Detailed routing; Design automation; Optical circuits

We show that this problem has a closed form global optimum solution, which estimates the salient object. We further show that along with the probabilistic framework, the proposed method also enjoys a wide range of interpretations, i.e. graph cut, diffusion maps and one-class classification. With an analysis according to these interpretations, we also find that our proposed method provides approximations to the global optimum to another criterion that integrates local/global contrast and large area saliency cues. The proposed unsupervised approach achieves mostly leading performance compared to the state-of-the-art unsupervised algorithms over a large set of salient object detection datasets including around 17k images for several evaluation metrics. Furthermore, the computational complexity of the proposed method is favorable/comparable to many state-of-the-art unsupervised techniques. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

This deep cavern (1.6 km), discovered in 2000, is very well preserved (e.g. intact floors) and thus favorable to research, especially given its rare association of parietal art and human remains, deposited in at least three locations. The scientific team working since 2009 presents here a first diachronic reconstruction of the natural (geological, biological) and anthropogenic (cultural, spiritual) elements relevant to the sectors of the cave accessible for study. In addition to the nuclear dating methods commonly used in karst contexts and decorated sites (U-Th and C-14 for speleothems, C-14-AMS for organic materials, bone and charcoal), we drew upon other disciplines to determine the relative chronology of the events that occurred in the cave: geosciences (karstology, sedimentary geology, geoarchaeology), biological anthropology, paleontology, zooarchaeology, anthracology, ichnology, lithic and osseous technology, and of course, the study of parietal art. Their integrated study enabled us to define a coherent and global chronological framework. The results confirm that bears frequented the cavity several times before any human incursions. Humans later ventured into the cave after it had already undergone several phases of karstogenesis, collapse, sedimentation, erosion and concretion formation. The nuclear methods and relative datingmethods employed concur in favor of the hypothesis of human incursions only during the Middle Gravettian period, approximately 28-29,000 cal BP, to carry out spiritual, graphic and sepulchral activities. After the cave was abandoned by Gravettian people, some final sedimentary and biological events occurred (partial flooding, concretion formation, presence of mesofauna and microfauna, etc.), but were insufficient to significantly modify the decorated and sepulchral sanctuary. Later human frequentations (Late Glacial, Late Magdalenian, Late Neolithic) are quantitatively anecdotal and, most importantly, were limited to the cave porch and vestibular areas, which were sealed-off from the internal zone by rockfall debris and Late Glacial or Holocene concretion formations.

1232,A Video Steganalytic Approach Against Quantized Transform Coefficient-Based H.264 Steganography by Exploiting In-Loop Deblocking Filtering,"Zhang, Hong; You, Weike; Zhao, Xianfeng","This article presents a method for detection of H.264 steganographic algorithms that modulate quantized transform coefficients (QTCs) for data hiding. The in-loop deblocking filter specified in the H.264 standard is used for attenuating the discontinuities at coded block boundaries. However, our investigation indicates that the deblocking filtering process would probably be affected by QTC modification. Therefore, we suggest performing steganalysis by considering the influence of QTC modification on filtering decisions and filtering operations. In the filtering of luma block edges, for each luma sample, we try to obtain the cumulative amount of modification applied to it caused by filtering operations, and determine the frequency of the modification made to its sample value. Based on this, a 768-dimensional feature set is designed for training and classification. Extensive experiments were conducted under a range of setups to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The corresponding experimental results demonstrate that, compared with the prior art, our proposed method is generally capable of providing superior performance on detecting QTC modification in H.264 video, even at low embedding strengths.",Streaming media; Discrete cosine transforms; Distortion; Video coding; Standards; Art; Deblocking filter; H; 264; steganalysis; steganography; transform coefficient
1233,Constrained Domain Adaptation for Image Segmentation,"Bateson, M.; Dolz, J.; Kervadec, H.; Lombaert, H.; Ben Ayed, I","Domain Adaption tasks have recently attracted substantial attention in computer vision as they improve the transferability of deep network models from a source to a target domain with different characteristics. A large body of state-of-the-art domain-adaptation methods was developed for image classification purposes, which may be inadequate for segmentation tasks. We propose to adapt segmentation networks with a constrained formulation, which embeds domain-invariant prior knowledge about the segmentation regions. Such knowledge may take the form of anatomical information, for instance, structure size or shape, which can be known a priori or learned from the source samples via an auxiliary task. Our general formulation imposes inequality constraints on the network predictions of unlabeled or weakly labeled target samples, thereby matching implicitly the prediction statistics of the target and source domains, with permitted uncertainty of prior knowledge. Furthermore, our inequality constraints easily integrate weak annotations of the target data, such as image-level tags. We address the ensuing constrained optimization problem with differentiable penalties, fully suited for conventional stochastic gradient descent approaches. Unlike common two-step adversarial training, our formulation is based on a single segmentation network, which simplifies adaptation, while improving training quality. Comparison with state-of-the-art adaptation methods reveals considerably better performance of our model on two challenging tasks. Particularly, it consistently yields a performance gain of 1-4% Dice across architectures and datasets. Our results also show robustness to imprecision in the prior knowledge. The versatility of our novel approach can be readily used in various segmentation problems, with code available publicly.",Image segmentation; Task analysis; Training; Biomedical imaging; Magnetic resonance imaging; Computed tomography; Annotations; CNN; deep learning; domain adaptation; multi-modal imaging; segmentation

It is characterized with recurrent. The pathogenesis is mainly associated with environmental factors, genetic susceptibility, dysbiosis of the intestinal flora and autoimmunity. The role of intestinal flora disorders in the pathogenesis and progression of UC is becoming increasingly prominent. More and more studies have confirmed that fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) could reshape the composition of UC intestinal flora and it is expected to be a new strategy for UC treatment. In this study, we used 2% Dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) for 7 days to induce acute colitis model in mice, and interfere with FMT and Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC). ELISA and immunohistochemistry were applied to detect the concentration and expression of NF-κB p65, STAT3 and IL-6. 16SrRNA high-throughput sequencing was performed to explore the composition of intestinal flora. The aim was to study the treatment effect of FMT on UC mice and explore its potential mechanism by observing the changes of intestinal flora composition and diversity, and its relationship with NF-κB p65, STAT3 and IL-6 expression. We conclude that FMT could improve intestinal flora disorder in mice with ulcerative colitis, regulate NF-κB signaling pathway, and significantly reduce intestinal inflammation in UC mice.",Fecal microbiota transplantation; Intestinal flora; Intestinal flora diversity; NF-κB; Ulcerative colitis.

Technologies such as augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR), 3D models, video lectures and other online resources enable three-dimensional visualization of the anatomical structures and allow students to learn more interactively. The aim of this study was to compare students' performance in the traditional anatomical courses in teaching neuroanatomy and technology-based learning methods such as video lectures, 3D models and 3D printed specimens. Four groups of first-year students of Veterinary Faculty established for the practical classes during the academic year 2021/2022 took part in this research. The total number of students participating in this research was 72. Each group attended separately the theoretical lecture with a demonstration based on a different technique; the control group used formalized specimens, while the three experimental groups used video lectures, 3D models and 3D printed specimens, respectively. Subsequently, all groups completed the same questionnaire testing their short-term memory of the neuroanatomical structures. After four weeks students were tested for their long-term memory of the neuroanatomy lecture with the follow-up test containing an identical list of questions. The test scores using video lectures and 3D printed models were significantly higher compared with the group that learned in the traditional way. This study suggests that alternative approaches such as technology-based digital methods can facilitate memorization of anatomical terms and structures in a more interactive and sensory engaging way of learning.",3D models; anatomy education; neuroanatomy; technology; video.
1236,A Novel Low Rank Smooth Flat-Field Correction Algorithm for Hyperspectral Microscopy Imaging,"Wang, Yukun; Gu, Yanfeng; Li, Xiaomei","A flat-field correction method is proposed for multiple measured hyperspectral microscopy imaging in this paper. As the most crucial preprocessing process in quantitative microscopic analysis, flat-field correction solves the uneven illumination caused by vignetting in microscopic images, and guarantees the precision of spatial and spectral information in hyperspectral microscopic imaging. In order to carry out flat-field correction and extract uneven illumination among groups of hyperspectral microscopic data containing hundreds of bands simultaneously, two properties of vignetting have been exploited: i) low-rank property is reflected by little information contained in vignetting; ii) local smoothness can be observed as a gradual change in brightness of vignetting, which is typically equivalent to the sparseness in spatial frequency domain. Combining the two properties above, a novel Low Rank Smooth Flat-field Correction (LRSFC) model modified from common orthogonal basis extraction is proposed, while an optimization is solved based on alternating direction multiplier method (ADMM), obtaining a unique flat-field term with low-rank and smooth properties. Qualitative and quantitative experimental assessments indicate that LRSFC does not add extra cell texture to the extracted flat-field term, whose performance appears prior to other state-of-the-art flat-field correction methods.",Alternating direction multiplier method; common and individual feature extraction; flat-field correction; hyperspectral microscopy imaging; vignetting

K.; Ampah, Ernest A.; Letsa, Demi P.; Nortey, Priscillia A.; Kwara, Awewura","Background: Optimal nutrition is a determinant of health in all persons. In persons living with HIV (PLHIV), nutrition is particularly important. Various factors, including dietary practices, play a role in guaranteeing nutritional health. Objectives: We investigated multiple non-prescription drugs use among HIV-positive persons receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART) from four treatment centers in southern Ghana. This paper, however, focuses on nutrient supplement use, food elimination, and food substitution practices by the PLHIV. Methods: Using quantitative and qualitative methods, we collected data from 540 HIV-positive persons at the health facility level. This paper focuses on only the quantitative data. Individual study participants were selected using a systematic random sampling procedure. Participants were interviewed after informed consent. We used univariate analysis to generate descriptive tabulations for key variables. Multivariable logistic regression modeling identified predictors of three practices (nutrient supplementation, food elimination, and food substitution). P value less than 0.05 or 95% confidence intervals facilitated determination of statistical significance. All analyses were performed using IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, version 20.0. Results: The use of nutrient supplements was a popular practice; 72% of the PLHIV used various kinds. The primary motive for the practice was to boost appetite and to gain weight. A little over 20% of the participants reportedly eliminated certain foods and beverages, while 17% introduced new foods since their initial HIV diagnosis. All the three practices were largely driven by the quest for improved health status. We determined predictors of nutrient supplementation to be ART clinic location and having an ART adherence monitor. Having an ART adherence monitor was significantly associated with reduced odds of nutrient supplementation (AOR = 0.34; 95% CI 0.12-0.95). The only predictor for food elimination was education level (AOR = 0.29; 95% CI 0.30-0.92); predictors of food substitution were ART clinic location (AOR = 0.11; 95% CI 0.02-0.69) and anemia (defined as hemoglobin concentration less than 11.0g/dl) (AOR = 0.21; 95% CI 0.12-0.85). Conclusions: The practice of supplementation is popular among this group of PLHIV. Food elimination and substitution are practiced, albeit in moderation. The predictors identified may prove helpful in provider-client encounters as well as local HIV programming.",Nutrient supplementation; Food elimination; Food substitution; HIV; ART; Ghana
1238,Efficient Epileptic Seizure Prediction Based on Deep Learning,"Daoud, Hisham; Bayoumi, Magdy A.","Epilepsy is one of the worlds most common neurological diseases. Early prediction of the incoming seizures has a great influence on epileptic patients' life. In this paper, a novel patient-specific seizure prediction technique based on deep learning and applied to long-term scalp electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings is proposed. The goal is to accurately detect the preictal brain state and differentiate it from the prevailing interictal state as early as possible and make it suitable for real time. The features extraction and classification processes are combined into a single automated system. Raw EEG signal without any preprocessing is considered as the input to the system which further reduces the computations. Four deep learning models are proposed to extract the most discriminative features which enhance the classification accuracy and prediction time. The proposed approach takes advantage of the convolutional neural network in extracting the significant spatial features from different scalp positions and the recurrent neural network in expecting the incidence of seizures earlier than the current methods. A semi-supervised approach based on transfer learning technique is introduced to improve the optimization problem. A channel selection algorithm is proposed to select the most relevant EEG channels which makes the proposed system good candidate for real-time usage. An effective test method is utilized to ensure robustness. The achieved highest accuracy of 99.6 and lowest false alarm rate of 0.004 ${{{\bf h}}<^>{ - 1}}$ along with very early seizure prediction time of 1 h make the proposed method the most efficient among the state of the art.",Classification; deep learning; epilepsy; EEG; interictal; preictal; seizure prediction
1239,A Generalized Structured Low-Rank Matrix Completion Algorithm for MR Image Recovery,"Hu, Yue; Liu, Xiaohan; Jacob, Mathews","Recent theory of mapping an image into a structured low-rank Toeplitz or Hankel matrix has become an effective method to restore images. In this paper, we introduce a generalized structured low-rank algorithm to recover images from their undersampled Fourier coefficients using infimal convolution regularizations. The image is modeled as the superposition of a piecewise constant component and a piecewise linear component. The Fourier coefficients of each component satisfy an annihilation relation, which results in a structured Toeplitz matrix. We exploit the low-rank property of the matrices to formulate a combined regularized optimization problem. In order to solve the problem efficiently and to avoid the high-memory demand resulting from the large-scale Toeplitz matrices, we introduce a fast and a memory-efficient algorithm based on the half-circulant approximation of the Toeplitz matrix. We demonstrate our algorithm in the context of single and multi-channel MR images recovery. Numerical experiments indicate that the proposed algorithm provides improved recovery performance over the state-of-the-art approaches.",Structured low-rank matrix; infimal convolution; compressed sensing; image recovery
1240,An efficient and locality-oriented Hausdorff distance algorithm: Proposal and analysis of paradigms and implementations,"Rodrigues, Erick Oliveira","Hausdorff distance (HD) is a popular similarity metric used in the comparison of images or 3D volumes. Although popular, its main weakness is computing power consumption, being one of the slowest set distances. In this work, a novel, parallel and locality-oriented Hausdorff distance implementation is pro-posed. Novel as it is the first time in the literature that an actual algorithmic implementation using mor-phological dilations is proposed and thoroughly evaluated. Parallel, as it is more robust in terms of par-allelization than the state-of-the-art algorithm and local as it has an intrinsic sensitivity to voxels that are closer in space. This proposal can be faster than the state-of-the-art in several practical cases such as in medical imaging registrations (up to 8 times faster on average in one of the CPU experiments) and is faster in the worst-case (up to 22337 times faster in one of the CPU experiments). Worst-case scenarios and high resolution volumes also favor the proposed approach. Throughout the work, several sequential and parallel CPU and GPU implementations are evaluated and compared.

1242,Least Squares Method for Identification of IGBT Thermal Impedance Networks Using Direct Temperature Measurements,"Achiri, Humphrey Mokom Njawah; Smidl, Vaclav; Peroutka, Zdenek; Streit, Lubos","State-of-the-art methods for determining thermal impedance networks for IGBT (Insulated Gate Bipolar Transistor) modules usually involves the establishment of the relationship between the measured transistor or diode voltage and temperature under homogenous temperature distribution across the IGBT module. The junction temperature is recomputed from the established voltage-temperature relationship and used in determining the thermal impedance network. This method requires accurate measurement of voltage drop across the transistors and diodes under specific designed heating and cooling profiles. Validation of the junction temperature is usually done using infrared camera or sensors placed close to the transistors or diodes (in some cases and open IGBT module) so that the measured temperature is as close to the junction as possible. In this paper, we propose an alternative method for determining the IGBT thermal impedance network using the principles of least squares. This method uses measured temperatures for defined heating and cooling cycles under different cooling conditions to determine the thermal impedance network. The results from the proposed method are compared with those obtained using state-of-the-art methods.",thermal impedance; junction temperature; foster network; Cauer network; least squares
1243,A Fast and Accurate Feature-Matching Algorithm for Minimally-Invasive Endoscopic Images,"Puerto-Souza, Gustavo A.; Mariottini, Gian-Luca","The ability to find image similarities between two distinct endoscopic views is known as feature matching, and is essential in many robotic-assisted minimally-invasive surgery (MIS) applications. Differently from feature-tracking methods, feature matching does not make any restrictive assumption about the chronological order between the two images or about the organ motion, but first obtains a set of appearance-based image matches, and subsequently removes possible outliers based on geometric constraints. As a consequence, feature-matching algorithms can be used to recover the position of any image feature after unexpected camera events, such as complete occlusions, sudden endoscopic-camera retraction, or strong illumination changes. We introduce the hierarchical multi-affine (HMA) algorithm, which improves over existing feature-matching methods because of the larger number of image correspondences, the increased speed, and the higher accuracy and robustness. We tested HMA over a large (and annotated) dataset with more than 100 MIS image pairs obtained from real interventions, and containing many of the aforementioned sudden events. In all of these cases, HMA outperforms the existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of speed, accuracy, and robustness. In addition, HMA and the image database are made freely available on the internet.",Abdomen; endoscopic image analysis; endoscopy; feature matching; robust estimation

1245,The applicability of repeat photography in rock art conservation: a case study of mixed methods in the Arkansan Ozarks,"Groom, Kaelin M.","Detailed scientific analyses of rock decay and site stability can aid rock art conservation but cultural sensitivity often limits the use of traditional methods, which often require rock samples or other invasive procedures. The need for intuitive non-invasive rock art analysis led to the creation of the Rock Art Stability Index (RASI). While RASI is a validated rock art assessment tool, a primarily quantitative approach can sometimes overlook the aesthetic component of rock art - a characteristic critical to the presentation and perceived value of the resource. Therefore, this research examined the applicability of repeat photography, or rephotography, in addition to RASI providing a more comprehensive approach. This mixed method approach was employed at three different rock art sites in the Arkansan Ozarks of varying lithologies, geographic characteristics, rock art type, and management policies. Results suggest that RASI allows for more consistent and reliable assessments, as rephotography has more restrictions and limitations. Nevertheless, when available, rephotography proved to be an immensely useful addition to quantitative research techniques, such as RASI, to provide heritage management with a more holistic evaluation addressing both geologic stability and changes in visual quality over time.",Cultural Resource Management; Geoarcheology; Heritage Science; Rock Art Stability Index (RASI); Cultural Stone Decay; Heritage Conservation
1246,Perspective-SIFT: An efficient tool for low-altitude remote sensing image registration,"Cai, Guo-Rong; Jodoin, Pierre-Marc; Li, Shao-Zi; Wu, Yun-Dong; Su, Song-Zhi; Huang, Zhen-Kun","This paper presents an automated image registration approach that is robust to perspective distortions. State-of-the-art method affine-SIFT uses affine transform to simulate various viewpoints to increase the robustness of registration. However, affine transformation does not follow the process by which real-world images are formed. To solve this problem, we propose a perspective scale invariant feature transform (PSIFT) that uses homographic transformation to simulate perspective distortion. As for ASIFT, PSIFT is based on the scale invariant feature transform (SIFT) and has a two-resolution scheme, namely a low-resolution phase and a high-resolution phase. The low-resolution phase of PSIFT simulates several image views following a perspective transformation by varying two camera axis orientation parameters. Given those simulated images, SIFT is then used to extract features and find matches among them. In the high-resolution phase, the perspective transformations which lead the largest number of matches in the low-resolution stage are selected to generate SIFT features on the original images. Experimental results obtained on three categories of low-altitude remote sensing images and Morel-Yu's dataset show that PSIFT outperforms significantly the state-of-the-art ASIFT, SIFT, Random Ferns, Harris-Affine, MSER and Hessian Affine, especially when images suffer severe perspective distortion.

These uncertainties give a notion of how well the embeddings represent a document. We present Bayesian subspace multinomial model (Bayesian SMM), a generative log-linear model that learns to represent documents in the form of Gaussian distributions, thereby encoding the uncertainty in its covariance. Additionally, in the proposed Bayesian SMM, we address a commonly encountered problem of intractability that appears during variational inference in mixed-logit models. We also present a generative Gaussian linear classifier for topic identification that exploits the uncertainty in document embeddings. Our intrinsic evaluation using perplexity measure shows that the proposed Bayesian SMM fits the unseen test data better as compared to the state-of-the-art neural variational document model on (Fisher) speech and (20Newsgroups) text corpora. Our topic identification experiments show that the proposed systems are robust to over-fitting on unseen test data.

1249,Single Image Super-Resolution Based on Wiener Filter in Similarity Domain,"Cruz, Cristovao; Mehta, Rakesh; Katkovnik, Vladimir; Egiazarian, Karen O.","Single image super-resolution (SISR) is an ill-posed problem aiming at estimating a plausible high-resolution (HR) image from a single low-resolution image. Current state-of-the-art SISR methods are patch-based. They use either external data or internal self-similarity to learn a prior for an HR image. External data-based methods utilize a large number of patches from the training data, while self-similarity-based approaches leverage one or more similar patches from the input image. In this paper, we propose a self-similarity-based approach that is able to use large groups of similar patches extracted from the input image to solve the SISR problem. We introduce a novel prior leading to the collaborative filtering of patch groups in a 1D similarity domain and couple it with an iterative back-projection framework. The performance of the proposed algorithm is evaluated on a number of SISR benchmark data sets. Without using any external data, the proposed approach outperforms the current non-convolutional neural network-based methods on the tested data sets for various scaling factors. On certain data sets, the gain is over 1 dB, when compared with the recent method A+. For high sampling rate (x4), the proposed method performs similarly to very recent state-of-the-art deep convolutional network-based approaches.",Block matching; sparsity; single image super-resolution

Its presence in this environment can induce effects on aquatic organisms that may compromise their fitness. Several experimental studies have demonstrated that fluoxetine can induce neurotoxicity, genetic and biochemical changes, and cause behavioral dysfunction in a wide range of fish species. However, contradictory results can be found. There is thus the need for a comprehensive review of the current state of knowledge on the effects of fluoxetine on fish at different levels of biological organization, highlighting inclusive patterns and discussing the potential causes for the contradictory results, that can be found in the available literature. This review also aims to explore and identify the main gaps in knowledge and areas for future research. We conclude that environmentally relevant concentrations of fluoxetine (e.g., from 0.00345 μg/L) produced adverse effects and often this concentration range is not addressed in conventional environmental risk assessment strategies. Its environmental persistence and ionizable properties reinforce the need for standardized testing with representative aquatic models, targeting endpoints sensitive to the specific mode of action of fluoxetine, in order to assess and rank its actual environmental risk to aquatic ecosystems.",Antidepressants; Effects; Environmental levels; SSRIs; Serotonin.

The retrogradation of starch could be inhibited by HMT combined with flavonoid addition up to 65.88%. Flavonoids with different structures showed significant differences in retarding retrogradation, which followed the order of epicatechin>epicatechin gallate>oligmeric proanthocyanidins. Structural analysis, infrared spectra and theoretical calculations showed that hydrogen bond interactions between starch and flavonoids retarded starch retrogradation by inhibiting the aggregation of starch molecules to form crystalline and aggregation structures. The retarding effect of flavonoids was related to their steric hindrance, flexibility and phenolic hydroxyl number. Epicatechin with minor steric hindrance and more flexibility favored its hydrogen bond interactions with starch, leading to the best retardation effect of starch retrogradation. This study would provide a theoretical and experimental basis for creating high-quality chestnut products.",Chestnut starch; Flavonoids; Heat-moisture treatment; Hydrogen bond interactions; Retrogradation.

The color correlation-based guided filters, such as minimized-Laplacian residual interpolation (MLRI), are known as the state-of-the-art demosaicing techniques. However, in the conventional guided filter-based techniques, the artifacts are generated in areas with low color correlation. Furthermore, a large number of line memories are required in the hardware implementation of a conventional guided filter-based technique because of the large effective field size. To overcome these two problems, we propose a color correlation-adaptive demosaicing algorithm that selectively applies a specific intracolor demosaicing to regions with low color correlation. We also propose an algorithm structure that reduces the effective field size in the vertical direction to reduce the number of line memories, while maintaining the image quality performance during the hardware implementation. The experimental results show that the proposed scheme can reduce the line memory to one-third while showing marginal performance degradation compared to the state-of-the-art MLRI weighted framework in terms of the color peak signal-to-noise ratio for the IMAX datasets.

Pyrochlore-structured spinel oxides can serve as model systems of geometrically frustrated three-dimensional quantum magnets; however, the nature of the magnetism in one well-studied spinel, ZnFe2O4, remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate simultaneous control of both stoichiometry and inversion disorder in the growth of ZnFe2O4 single crystals, directly yielding a revised understanding of both the collective spin behavior and lattice symmetry. Crystals grown in the stoichiometric limit with minimal site inversion disorder contravene all the previously suggested exotic spin phases in ZnFe2O4. Furthermore, the structure is confirmed on the [Formula: see text] space group with broken inversion symmetry that induces antiferroelectricity. The effective tuning of magnetic behavior by site disorder in the presence of robust antiferroelectricity makes ZnFe2O4 of special interest to multiferroic devices.",antiferroelectricity; antiferromagnetic spinel; inversion disorder; neutron magnetic diffuse scattering; single-crystal growth.

Herein, a dual-mode magnetic relaxation switch (MRS) and fluorescence (FL) biosensing strategy was developed to efficiently detect RTB using fluorescent magnetic nanoparticles (MNP300@SiO2(FITC)). Meanwhile, the as-prepared composite MNP300@SiO2(FITC) exhibited superior biocompatibility and increased FL readout and was coupled with aptamer (Apt) to form a captured probe. Magnetic nanoparticles, 30 nm in diameter (MNP30), were coupled to a Blocker to form a paired probe to compete with RTB for Apt binding. The presence of the RTB triggered the dual-mode detection switch, thus, weakening the magnetic and fluorescent signals. Compared with the single-mode detection method, the Δ T2 and Δ FL intensity here exhibited an excellent linear relationship with logarithm of RTB concentrations at 0.001-500 ng/mL and 0.005-500 ng/mL, and obtained ultrahigh sensitivities of 0.8 pg/mL and 3 pg/mL, respectively. In addition, the dual-mode biosensor gained satisfactory spiked recoveries and relative standard deviations for quantitative detection of spiked RTB in edible oil and tap water samples. To our knowledge, this is the first study to describe the accurate quantification of RTB using a sensitive MRS-FL biosensor.

State-of-the-art computed tomography (CT) scanners have now been integrated into multi-modality PET-CT and SPECT-CT devices, and these devices, particularly PET-CT scanners, are dramatically impacting clinical practice. F-18-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG), by far the most widely, used radio pharmaceutical for clinical PET imaging in general and oncologic PET imaging in particular, is highly accurate in detecting (similar to 90%) and staging many types of tumors, monitoring therapy response, and differentiating benign from malignant lesions. Several factors, including the relatively high administered activities [e.g., 370-740 MBq (10-20 mCi) of FDG], the high patient throughput (up to 30 patients per d), and in particular, the uniquely high energies (for a diagnostic setting) of the 511-keV positron-negatron annihilation photons, make shielding requirements, workflow, and other radiation protection issues important considerations in the design of a PET or PET-CT facility. The Report of Task Group 108 of the American Association of Physicists in Medicine (AAPM) provides a comprehensive summary of shielding design and related considerations, along with illustrative calculations. Whether in the form of a PET-CT or a SPECT-CT device, the introduction of CT scanners into a nuclear medicine setting has created new and complex radiation protection issues concerning the radiation burden and attendant risks accrued by patients undergoing such multi-modality procedures (especially in those instances in which higher-dose, diagnostic-quality CT studies are done as part of the PET-CT or SPECT-CT exam). In addition, because PET is dependent on the availability of short-lived F-18 (T-p = 110 min) primarily in the form of FDG, and other short-lived positron emitters such as C-11 (20 min), N-13 (10 min), and O-15 (2 min), cyclotrons for production of medically applied radionuclides and associated radiochemistry facilities are now widespread (well over 100 worldwide) and present their own radiation safety issues. In addition to the radioactive product, sources of exposure include neutrons and radioactive activation products in the various cyclotron components and surrounding shielding. Nonetheless, published studies have shown that the radiation doses to personnel working in cyclotron and associated radiochemistry facilities, as well as in PET or PET-CT and SPECT or SPECT-CT facilities, can be maintained below, and generally well below, the pertinent regulatory limits. This presentation will review the basic radiation safety aspects, including shielding and workflow, of these increasingly important and increasingly numerous facilities.

XMGs have been applied in various applications, including: 1) exact-synthesis-aware rewriting; 2) preoptimization for 6-input look-up table (6-LUT) mapping; and 3) synthesis of quantum circuits. An experimental evaluation shows that our algorithm leads to better XMGs compared to state-of-the-art algorithms based on XMGs, which positively affects all of these three applications.

Therefore, we propose a novel robust PCA unrolling network with sparse feature selection for super-resolution XCA vessel imaging.

Since ATR was more persistent in the water, the specific damage caused by ATR to aquatic organisms should be concern. The role of P450/ROS has been proposed in many pathomechanisms. To explore whether P450/ROS mediated necroptosis and promote inflammatory response caused by ATR exposure, 120 common carp (Cyprinus carpio L.) were randomly divided into four groups which were exposed to 0 μg/L, 4 μg/L, 40 μg/L and 400 μg/L ATR respectively. The residual levels of ATR and its metabolites increased, signs of necrosis and inflammation were found in the gills of the ATR-treatment groups. The levels of ROS and cytochrome P450 content were increased, and P450 enzymes were activated. The expression levels of the core components of necroptosis (RIPK1, RIPK3 and MLKL) increased. Moreover, gene expression of inflammatory factors (TNF-α, NF-κB, iNOS, COX-2, IL-1β and PTGE) increased significantly in the ATR-spiked group.

1268,"Laser beam machining (LBM), state of the art and new opportunities","Meijer, J","An overview is given of the state of the art of laser beam machining in general with special emphasis on applications of short and ultrashort lasers. In laser welding the trend is to apply optical sensors for process control. Laser surface treatment is mostly used to apply corrosion and wear resistant layers, but also for repair of engine and machine parts. In micro-machining, shorter pulses reduce heat-affected damage of the material and opens new ways for nanometer accuracy. Even 40 years after the development of the laser there is a lot of effort in developing new and better performing lasers. The driving force is higher accuracy at reasonable cost, which is realised by compact systems delivering short laser pulses of high beam quality. Another trend is the shift towards shorter wavelengths, which are better absorbed by the material and which allows smaller feature sizes to be produced. Examples of new products, which became possible by this technique, are given.

1269,Kalman-Based Real-Time Functional Decomposition for the Spectral Calibration in Swept Source Optical Coherence Tomography,"Zavareh, Amir Tofighi; Hoyos, Sebastian","This paper presents a real-time functional decomposition adaptive algorithm for the optimal sampling of the interferometric signal in Swept-Source Optical Coherence Tomography imaging systems, which completely eliminates the input signal dependent nonlinearities that are problematic in current state-of-the-art OCT realizations that use interpolation and resampling. The proposed adaptive calibration algorithm uses the Kalman approach to estimate the wavenumber index parameter k from the Mach-Zender Interferometer signal which is then applied to an adaptive level crossing sampler to generate a sampling clock that k-linearizes the data on real-time during the sampling process. Such a system implements an artifact-free realization of the technology removing the need for classical interpolation and resampling. The new real-time linearization scheme has the additional capability of increasing the imaging acquisition speed by 10X while providing robustness to noise, properties that are demonstrated through mathematical analysis and simulation results throughout the paper.",Kalman Filtering; Machine Learning; Mach-Zehnder Interferometer; Michelson Interferometer; Optical Coherence Tomography; Spectral Calibration; Swept Source Optical Coherence Tomography

Even though many methods have been built to tackle automatic detection and segmentation of polyps, benchmarking of state-of-the-art methods still remains an open problem. This is due to the increasing number of researched computer vision methods that can be applied to polyp datasets. Benchmarking of novel methods can provide a direction to the development of automated polyp detection and segmentation tasks. Furthermore, it ensures that the produced results in the community are reproducible and provide a fair comparison of developed methods. In this paper, we benchmark several recent state-of-the-art methods using Kvasir-SEG, an open-access dataset of colonoscopy images for polyp detection, localisation, and segmentation evaluating both method accuracy and speed. Whilst, most methods in literature have competitive performance over accuracy, we show that the proposed ColonSegNet achieved a better trade-off between an average precision of 0.8000 and mean IoU of 0.8100, and the fastest speed of 180 frames per second for the detection and localisation task. Likewise, the proposed ColonSegNet achieved a competitive dice coefficient of 0.8206 and the best average speed of 182.38 frames per second for the segmentation task. Our comprehensive comparison with various state-of-the-art methods reveals the importance of benchmarking the deep learning methods for automated real-time polyp identification and delineations that can potentially transform current clinical practices and minimise miss-detection rates.",Colonoscopy; Image segmentation; Benchmark testing; Real-time systems; Cancer; Videos; Biomedical imaging; Medical image segmentation; ColonSegNet; colonoscopy; polyps; deep learning; detection; localisation; benchmarking; Kvasir-SEG

It aims to predict top-down visual attention maps focused on manipulated objects, that are then used for psycho-visual weighting of features in the problem of manipulated object recognition. The model is probabilistically defined using both global and local appearance features extracted from automatically segmented arm areas and objects. A psycho-visual experiment has been conducted in a guided framework that compares our proposal and other popular state-of-the-art models with respect to human gaze fixations. The obtained results show that our approach outperforms several popular bottom-up saliency approaches in a well-known egocentric dataset Furthermore, an additional task-driven assessment for object recognition in egocentric video reveals that the proposed method improves the performance of several state-of-the-art techniques for object detection.

Hydraulic functioning during this mobilization process is not well understood, and contradictory results exist on the direct effect of drought on carbohydrate mobilization. In a dedicated experiment, wheat plants were subjected to drought stress during carbohydrate mobilization. Measurements, important to better understand stem physiology, showed some unexpected patterns that could not be explained by our current knowledge on water transport. Traditional water flow and storage models failed to properly describe the drought response in wheat stems during carbohydrate mobilization. To explain the measured patterns, hypotheses were formulated and integrated in a dedicated model for wheat. The new mechanistic model simulates two hypothetical water storage compartments: one where water is quickly exchanged with the xylem and one that contains the carbohydrate storage. Water exchange between these compartments is turgor-driven. The model was able to simulate the measured increase in stored carbohydrate concentrations with a decrease in water content and stem diameter. Calibration of the model showed the importance of turgor-driven apoplastic water flow during carbohydrate mobilization. This resulted in an increase in stem hydraulic capacitance, which became more important under drought stress.",Triticum aestivum; composite transport model; drought stress; hydrostatic gradient; mobilization; osmotic adjustment; remobilization; water-soluble carbohydrates (WSC).
1274,Feature Ranking by Variational Dropout for Classification Using Thermograms from Diabetic Foot Ulcers,"Hernandez-Guedes, Abian; Arteaga-Marrero, Natalia; Villa, Enrique; Callico, Gustavo M.; Ruiz-Alzola, Juan","Diabetes mellitus presents a high prevalence around the world. A common and long-term derived complication is diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs), which have a global prevalence of roughly 6.3%, and a lifetime incidence of up to 34%. Infrared thermograms, covering the entire plantar aspect of both feet, can be employed to monitor the risk of developing a foot ulcer, because diabetic patients exhibit an abnormal pattern that may indicate a foot disorder. In this study, the publicly available INAOE dataset composed of thermogram images of healthy and diabetic subjects was employed to extract relevant features aiming to establish a set of state-of-the-art features that efficiently classify DFU. This database was extended and balanced by fusing it with private local thermograms from healthy volunteers and generating synthetic data via synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE). State-of-the-art features were extracted using two classical approaches, LASSO and random forest, as well as two variational deep learning (DL)-based ones: concrete and variational dropout. Then, the most relevant features were detected and ranked. Subsequently, the extracted features were employed to classify subjects at risk of developing an ulcer using as reference a support vector machine (SVM) classifier with a fixed hyperparameter configuration to evaluate the robustness of the selected features. The new set of features extracted considerably differed from those currently considered state-of-the-art but provided a fair performance. Among the implemented extraction approaches, the variational DL ones, particularly the concrete dropout, performed the best, reporting an F1 score of 90% using the aforementioned SVM classifier. In comparison with features previously considered as the state-of-the-art, approximately 15% better performance was achieved for classification.",thermography; infrared; deep learning; feature extraction; diabetic foot
1275,Exploring Context and Content Links in Social Media: A Latent Space Method,"Qi, Guo-Jun; Aggarwal, Charu; Tian, Qi; Ji, Heng; Huang, Thomas S.","Social media networks contain both content and context-specific information. Most existing methods work with either of the two for the purpose of multimedia mining and retrieval. In reality, both content and context information are rich sources of information for mining, and the full power of mining and processing algorithms can be realized only with the use of a combination of the two. This paper proposes a new algorithm which mines both context and content links in social media networks to discover the underlying latent semantic space. This mapping of the multimedia objects into latent feature vectors enables the use of any off-the-shelf multimedia retrieval algorithms. Compared to the state-of-the-art latent methods in multimedia analysis, this algorithm effectively solves the problem of sparse context links by mining the geometric structure underlying the content links between multimedia objects. Specifically for multimedia annotation, we show that an effective algorithm can be developed to directly construct annotation models by simultaneously leveraging both context and content information based on latent structure between correlated semantic concepts. We conduct experiments on the Flickr data set, which contains user tags linked with images. We illustrate the advantages of our approach over the state-of-the-art multimedia retrieval techniques.",Context and content links; latent semantic space; low-rank method; social Media; multimedia information networks
1276,Analysis Operator Learning and its Application to Image Reconstruction,"Hawe, Simon; Kleinsteuber, Martin; Diepold, Klaus","Exploiting a priori known structural information lies at the core of many image reconstruction methods that can be stated as inverse problems. The synthesis model, which assumes that images can be decomposed into a linear combination of very few atoms of some dictionary, is now a well established tool for the design of image reconstruction algorithms. An interesting alternative is the analysis model, where the signal is multiplied by an analysis operator and the outcome is assumed to be sparse. This approach has only recently gained increasing interest. The quality of reconstruction methods based on an analysis model severely depends on the right choice of the suitable operator. In this paper, we present an algorithm for learning an analysis operator from training images. Our method is based on l(p)-norm minimization on the set of full rank matrices with normalized columns. We carefully introduce the employed conjugate gradient method on manifolds, and explain the underlying geometry of the constraints. Moreover, we compare our approach to state-of-the-art methods for image denoising, inpainting, and single image super-resolution. Our numerical results show competitive performance of our general approach in all presented applications compared to the specialized state-of-the-art techniques.",Analysis operator learning; geometric conjugate gradient; image reconstruction; inverse problems; oblique manifold

The effects of PM under 10 μm (PM10) and diesel PM (DPM) on respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection were investigated in human two-dimensional lung epithelial cells and human three-dimensional lung organoids mimicking the lung tissue. We evaluated the formation of stress granules, which are important in cellular adaptation to various stress conditions. Furthermore, we investigated the effects of repeated exposure to PM10 and DPM on DNA damage and cell death during viral infection. PM10 and DPM did not cause stress granule formation in the absence of RSV infection but drastically increased stress granule formation and signal transduction during RSV infection in human lung epithelial cells and human lung organoids. Further, repeated exposure to PM10 and DPM caused cell death by severely damaging DNA under RSV infection conditions. Thus, PM10 and DPM induce severe lung toxicity under stress conditions, such as viral infection, suggesting that the effects of PMs under various stressful conditions should be examined to accurately predict the lung toxicity of PM.",DNA damage; Human lung organoid; Particulate matter; Respiratory syncytial virus; Stress granule.

This source is unique because it includes cohorts of women whose reproductive lives took place before, during, and after the baby boom. Traditional contraceptive methods (withdrawal and periodic abstinence) were central to the experience of the first set of women, while the last set made full use of modern as well as some traditional methods. For the first cohorts, traditional methods spearheaded the historic decline in fertility, while among the last set of women modern methods led to a precipitous decline towards the below-replacement fertility that continues in Spain today. There is no evidence that the modest increases in fertility during the baby boom in Spain were the result of a decline in the use of contraception among married women.",Spain; baby boom; contraceptive methods; fertility; fertility decline; low fertility.

Due to the ability to discover problem-specific features, deep learning and especially convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been successfully and widely used for image representation learning. However, available and stable household garbage datasets are insufficient, which seriously limits the development of research and application. Besides, the state-of-the-art in the field of garbage image classification is not entirely clear. To solve this problem, in this study, we built a new open benchmark dataset for household garbage image classification by simulating different lightings, backgrounds, angles, and shapes. This dataset is named 30 classes of household garbage images (HGI-30), which contains 18 000 images of 30 household garbage classes. The publicly available HGI-30 dataset allows researchers to develop accurate and robust methods for household garbage recognition.

In CS-MRI, we want to reconstruct a high-quality image from very few samples in a short time. In this paper, we propose a fast algorithm, called projected iterative soft-thresholding algorithm (pISTA), and its acceleration pFISTA for CS-MRI image reconstruction. The proposed algorithms exploit sparsity of the magnetic resonance (MR) images under the redundant representation of tight frames. We prove that pISTA and pFISTA converge to a minimizer of a convex function with a balanced tight frame sparsity formulation. The pFISTA introduces only one adjustable parameter, the step size, and we provide an explicit rule to set this parameter. Numerical experiment results demonstrate that pFISTA leads to faster convergence speeds than the state-of-art counterpart does, while achieving comparable reconstruction errors. Moreover, reconstruction errors incurred by pFISTA appear insensitive to the step size.",Compressed sensing; iterative thresholding; MRI; sparse models; tight frames

MSM also face increased risk of human immunodeficiency virus infection. However, it is not known whether IPV experience of MSM in China would affect their attitudes toward pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) use. A cross-sectional study was conducted to explore the associations between different types of IPV and willingness to use PrEP in a sample of 608 MSM from November 2018 to May 2019 in Chengdu, China. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to explore the associations between different types of IPV and willingness to use PrEP. The average age of the participants was 31.8 ± 12.3 years, 48.9% of them were aware of PrEP before this study, and only 7.2% were aware of long-acting injectable PrEP (LAI-PrEP). The overall willingness to use any type of PrEP in the next 6 months was 82.2%. Approximately one third of the participants (n = 198) had experienced at least one type of IPV. We found that experience of sexual perpetration was negatively associated with the willingness to use on-demand PrEP (adjusted odds ratio [ORa] = 0.33, 95% CI = 0.16-0.67) and the overall willingness to use any type of PrEP (ORa = 0.31, 95% CI = 0.15-0.64). The willingness to use LAI-PrEP also had negative associations with any type of monitoring IPV (ORa = 0.58, 95% CI = 0.38-0.91), controlling victimization (ORa = 0.41, 95% CI = 0.21-0.82), and emotional victimization (ORa = 0.58, 95% CI = 0.35-0.97). The findings of this study demonstrate that IPV experiences are negatively associated with willingness to use PrEP among MSM, suggesting that PrEP promotion programs should consider IPV screening and develop explicit intervention strategies for both perpetrators and victims.",China; intimate partner violence; long-acting injectable PrEP; men who have sex with men; pre-exposure prophylaxis; willingness to use PrEP.

Due to 21st century toxicology approaches, risk of PAs can be better discerned though an understanding of differing toxic potencies, but it is often mixtures of PAs that are found as contaminants in foods, for example, herbal teas and honey, food supplements and herbal medicines. Our study investigated whether genotoxicity potency of PAs dosed individually or in mixtures differed when measured using micronuclei formation in vitro in HepaRG human liver cells, which we and others have shown to be suitable for observing genotoxic potency differences across different PA structural classes. When equipotent concentrations of up to six different PAs representing a wide range of potencies in vitro were tested as mixtures, the observed genotoxic potency aligned favorably with results for single PAs. Similarly, when the BMD confidence intervals of these equipotent mixtures were compared with the confidence intervals of the individual PAs, only minimal variation was observed. These data support a conclusion that for this class of plant impurities, all acting via the same DNA-reactive mode of action, genotoxic potency can be regarded as additive when assessing the risk of mixtures of PAs.",HepaRG; genetic toxicology; micronucleus test; mixture risk assessment; pyrrolizidine alkaloids; relative potency.

Novel reduction criteria have been proposed, and extensive experiments have been carried out over five publicly available benchmarks, using two state-of-the-art fingerprint indexing techniques. Although quite simple, the proposed criteria achieved remarkable results, allowing a substantial reduction of the candidate list: for instance, at 1% error rate, the average penetration rate of a state-of-the-art minutiae-based indexer decreases from 27% to 3.9% on FVC2000 DB2.

Corine land cover change outputs were examined for four periods (1990-2000; 2000-2006; 2006-2012; and 2012-2018). During these analyses, the period when the water area changes in the lakes occur the most was determined. Moreover, other land cover changes occurring in the region were defined. The LCC results were compared and discussed in terms of some human factors (i.e., human development index and terrestrial human footprint). According to the results of this study, it was observed that there was a severe decline in the lake surface water located in the Sultan Marshes National Park Area. The water's surface in the lakes decreased by 50% in the 2000s compared to previous years and decreased until 2006. This withdrawal was prominent especially in Lake Yay and Lake Çöl. Considering the human factors (Human Development Index) and variables (terrestrial Human Footprint) in terms of the spatio-temporal land cover change, it is seen that the human development in the region increased from 0.54 to 0.81 from 1990 to 2018, and the human footprint increased the most in 1993. Water area changes occurred at a high rate between 1990-2000 and 2000-2006. It results from the growing demand for basic needs (such as water consumption and food diversity) with increasing human development and expanded agricultural practices in the region and overuse of the ground and aboveground waters that are the source of the lakes. Especially between 1990 and 2000, the high number of human interventions in the region caused the human footprint to be higher in 1993 than in 2009. Unless the Sultan Marshes have the proper planning and policies, it faces the danger of complete drying up with the effects of climate change in the future.",GIS; Global terrestrial human footprint; Human Development Index; Land cover change; Wetlands.

Histological Image Classification ensembles strive to accurately detect abnormal tissues in the breast samples by determining the correlation between the predictions of its weak learners. Nonetheless, the state-of-the-art ensemble methods, such as boosting and bagging, count merely on manipulating the dataset and lack intelligent ensemble decision making. Furthermore, the methods mentioned above are short of the diversity of the weak models of the ensemble. Likewise, other commonly used voting strategies, such as weighted averaging, are limited to how the classifiers' diversity and accuracy are balanced. Hence, In this paper, we assemble a Neural Network ensemble that integrates the models trained on small datasets by employing biologically-inspired methods. Our procedure is comprised of two stages. First, we train multiple heterogeneous pre-trained models on the benchmark Breast Histopathology Images for Invasive Ductal Carcinoma (IDC) classification dataset. In the second meta-training phase, we utilize the differential Cartesian Genetic Programming (dCGP) to generate a Neural Network that merges the trained models optimally. We compared our empirical outcomes with other state-of-the-art techniques.

Existing models for vision-based mapping and navigation, however, suffer from memory requirements that increase linearly with exploration duration and indirect path following behaviors. This article presents e-TM, a self-organizing neural network-based framework for incremental topological mapping and navigation. e-TM models the exploration trajectories explicitly as episodic memory, wherein salient landmarks are sequentially extracted as ``events'' from streaming observations. A memory consolidation procedure then performs a playback mechanism and transfers the embedded knowledge of the environmental layout into spatial memory, encoding topological relations between landmarks. Fusion adaptive resonance theory (ART) networks, as the building block of the two memory modules, can generalize multiple input patterns into memory templates and, therefore, provide a compact spatial representation and support the discovery of novel shortcuts through inferences. For navigation, e-TM applies a transfer learning paradigm to integrate human demonstrations into a pretrained locomotion network for smoother movements. Experimental results based on VizDoom, a simulated 3-D environment, have shown that, compared to semiparametric topological memory (SPTM), a state-of-the-art model, e-TM reduces the time costs of navigation significantly while learning much sparser topological graphs.",Navigation; Subspace constraints; Visualization; Layout; Hippocampus; Computational modeling; Aerospace electronics; Episodic memory; fine-tuned motion control; fusion adaptive resonance theory (ART) networks; spatial memory; topological graphs

The performance of the proposed method is evaluated and compared with six state-of-the-art optimization algorithms using an MIMO antenna example.

Immunohistochemical, western blot and PCR analyses revealed that these tissues expressed BAT markers such as uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) and CIDEA, but not white adipose markers, and β3-adrenergic stimulation increased UCP1 amounts, a classic characteristic of BAT tissue. The newly identified BAT stores contained extensive sympathetic innervation with high mitochondrial density and multilocular lipid droplets similar to interscapular BAT. BAT repositories were present and functional neonatally, and showed developmental changes between the neonatal and adult periods. In summary, several new depots showing classical BAT characteristics are reported and characterized in the lower abdominal/pelvic region of mice. These BAT stores are likely significant metabolic regulators in the mouse and some data suggests that similar BAT depots may also exist in humans.",UCP1; muscle; thermogenesis; ureter; uterus.
1294,Super Resolution Wide Aperture Automotive Radar,"Bialer, Oded; Jonas, Amnon; Tirer, Tom","State-of-the-art automotive radars have an angular resolution of 1 degrees, which is insufficient for estimating the objects shape and boundaries at long distance. In this paper, we design a novel automotive radar with 1m aperture, which is an order of magnitude larger aperture than state-of-the-art automotive radars, and thus achieves super high angular resolution of 0.1 degrees. The radar is designed to overcomes the major technical challenges of a wide aperture radar, which are: non-robust phase coherency over a wide aperture, spanning a wide aperture with sparse antenna elements, simultaneous non-interfering transmissions from a relatively large number of transmit antennas with unambiguous target speed estimation, and high complexity of near-field beamforming. We demonstrate the super high resolution performance of the radar in automotive scenarios, and show that it attains comparable results to a high resolution LIDAR at short range, and outperforms the LIDAR at long ranges. The wide aperture radar has the potential to enable autonomous driving at higher speed, and also to increase the operation of autonomous driving to more regions and climates.",Radar; Radar antennas; Automotive engineering; Receiving antennas; Transmitting antennas; Aperture antennas; Autonomous vehicles; Automotive radar; wide aperture radar; high resolution radar; autonomous driving radar

Current state-of-the-art techniques for parsing volumetric medical image data are typically based on machine learning methods that exploit large annotated image databases. Two main challenges need to be addressed, these are the efficiency in scanning high-dimensional parametric spaces and the need for representative image features which require significant efforts of manual engineering. We propose a pipeline for object detection and segmentation in the context of volumetric image parsing, solving a two-step learning problem: anatomical pose estimation and boundary delineation. For this task we introduce Marginal Space Deep Learning (MSDL), a novel framework exploiting both the strengths of efficient object parametrization in hierarchical marginal spaces and the automated feature design of Deep Learning (DL) network architectures. In the 3D context, the application of deep learning systems is limited by the very high complexity of the parametrization. More specifically 9 parameters are necessary to describe a restricted affine transformation in 3D, resulting in a prohibitive amount of billions of scanning hypotheses. The mechanism of marginal space learning provides excellent run-time performance by learning classifiers in clustered, high-probability regions in spaces of gradually increasing dimensionality. To further increase computational efficiency and robustness, in our system we learn sparse adaptive data sampling patterns that automatically capture the structure of the input. Given the object localization, we propose a DL-based active shape model to estimate the non-rigid object boundary. Experimental results are presented on the aortic valve in ultrasound using an extensive dataset of 2891 volumes from 869 patients, showing significant improvements of up to 45.2% over the state-of-the-art. To our knowledge, this is the first successful demonstration of the DL potential to detection and segmentation in full 3D data with parametrized representations.",Deep learning; image parsing; marginal space learning; sparse representations; three-dimensional (3D) object detection and segmentation

In this paper, we propose a cross feature fusion neural network (CFFNN) for the enhancement of CF. Existing studies overlook either user preferences for various item features or the relationship between item features and user features. To solve this problem, we construct a cross feature fusion network to enable the fusion of user features and item features as well as a self-attention network to determine users' preferences for items. Specifically, we design a feature extraction layer with multiple MLP (Multilayer Perceptrons) modules to extract both user features and item features. Then, we introduce a cross feature fusion mechanism for an accurate determination of the relationship between different user-item interactions. The features of users and items are crossly embedded and then fed into a prediction network. The attention mechanism enables the model to focus on more effective features. The effectiveness of CFFNN model is demonstrated through extensive experiments on four real-world datasets. The experimental results indicate that CFFNN significantly outperforms the existing state-of-the-art models, with a relative improvement of 3.0 to 12.1 percent on hit ratio (HR) and normalized discounted cumulative gain (NDCG) compared with the baselines.",Feature extraction; Neural networks; Convolution; Collaboration; Fuses; Data models; Adaptation models; Collaborative filtering; neural recommendation models; cross feature fusion; attention networks

The development of tools and strategies to monitor at different scales resources and waste flows would allow for better resource planning and a more sustainable management on territory. The aim of this study is to investigate and analyse the supply chain that deals with the management of steel slags at meso-level, in order to investigate the state of implementation of industrial symbiosis (IS), its potential and its improvement. A Mass Flow Analysis (MFA) has been implemented, through big data analysis coming from the integration of regional and provincial databases with a careful data processing from questionnaires. This integrated methodology has proved to be a valid tool to monitor the recovery and reuse, the implementation of industrial symbiosis and to plan improvement actions. This paper reports a representation of the current situation regarding the production, recovery and reuse of these materials in production processes for which they are suitable, with a view to their full exploitation, following the principles of circular economy and an analysis of the mutual exchange that occur among steelmaking plants and other business partners in a network of industrial companies. The results showed that most of the steel slags managed at meso-level (Province of Brescia, Italy) is still unfortunately destined for landfill with low percentage of them classified as by-product highlighting as the IS is not adequately applied. Of the slag destined for treatments and recovery processes, almost all of them are Electric Arc Furnace slag, which are mainly reused for hydraulically bound base layers and road sub-bases (about 85% of the total recovered) and as aggregates for the production of cement and bituminous mixes (about 15% of the total recovered). Results shows as further effort should be made in term of policies and strategies to incentivize IS and to increase the recovery.",Big data; Industrial Symbiosis; Mass Flow Analysis; Recovery; Reuse; Steel slag.

The art productions discussed in this article are located in four UNESCO global geoparks (Monts d'Ardeche and Haute-Provence in France, Sobrarbe in the Aragonese Pyrenees and Lanzarote in Canary Islands, Spain). Site-specific art installed in natural settings will oftentimes call upon this geodiversity, or its heritage component (sometimes exceptional in geomorphology, aesthetics or age), for inspiration in both forms and materials used. This article is primarily concerned with the artistic and geographical specificities of these artworks, and then sketches a panorama of artistic production of space of the four geoparks selected in France and Spain. Finally, the << services >> provided by these artistic programs to the protected areas and to all the actors who animate them will be discussed. It appears that these various artistic productions can serve as tools of territorial control that allow certain artists, institutions and even administrations or businesses to claim or reclaim spaces they can/did not directly manage. This phenomenon could be a positive form of territorial control when it leads to the improved protection of geodiversity. However, it may also be criticized when it involves forms of political instrumentalization and uses strategies of territorial marketing, thus opening the door to tourist overcrowding.",geodiversity; geopark; site-specific art; France; Spain

GPs are powerful and flexible nonparametric models for multivariate nonlinear functions. To validate the GP model, we compare the results achieved with a second-order polynomial model, which is the most widely used regression model for characterization purposes. We applied the methodology on a set of raw images of rock art scenes collected with two different Single Lens Reflex (SLR) cameras. A leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) procedure was used to assess the predictive performance of the models in terms of CIE XYZ residuals and Delta E-ab* color differences. Values of less than 3 CIELAB units were achieved for Delta E-ab*. The output sRGB characterized images show that both regression models are suitable for practical applications in cultural heritage documentation. However, the results show that colorimetric characterization based on the Gaussian process provides significantly better results, with lower values for residuals and Delta E-ab*. We also analyzed the induced noise into the output image after applying the camera characterization. As the noise depends on the specific camera, proper camera selection is essential for the photogrammetric work.",cultural heritage; camera characterization; polynomial regression; Gaussian processes; colorimetry; CIE color spaces; noise analysis

Using a state-of-the-art circuit-editing technique, an attacker can remove an IC's top metal layer, leaving its secure information exposed to micro-probing attacks. Security ICs can be seriously threatened by such attacks and thus require on-chip countermeasures. Conventional active shields, however, have difficulty coping with physical attacks based on FIB chip editing (i.e., bypassing the top metal shield). This study presents a novel countermeasure against physical attacks based on the use of a reconfigurable metal shield for both top metal removal and micro-probing attack detection. This shield consists of two circuits: an FIB chip editing detection circuit consisting of a random number generator and a micro-probing attempt detection circuit consisting of two conditionally synchronized ring oscillators. Both circuits share a randomly reconfigured top metal shield, which represents a promising solution for security against state-of-the-art invasive attacks.",Terms-Active shield; hardware security; invasive attack; micro-probing attempt; top metal shield

A ""metric graph"" on a set of edges between voxels is constructed from the dense voxel embeddings generated by a convolutional network. Partitioning the metric graph with long-range edges as repulsive constraints yields an initial segmentation with high precision, with substantial accuracy gain for very thin objects.

The prevalence of viral presence in the ocular tissue necessitates a focus on the handling of donor ocular tissue and the functioning of eye banks, ensuring it doesn't risk the patient and the doctor's safety. Restrictions in the movement of people during the pandemic limited the number of donations, causing a shortage of tissues, with a large number of people already waitlisted for tissue needs. The lesson from the COVID-19 pandemic directs us to look for long-term corneal storage techniques taking into consideration the tissue viability time and the possibility of post-pandemic shortages. Although there is not a significant number of reports, the cases of corneal graft rejection post-vaccination against COVID-19 are highlighted and thus should form a part of the lookout while evaluating the possible cause of rejection of grafts.

Undertaken over a period of two years, the project aimed to find a suitable form of memorialising this significant event in a way that was appropriate and meaningful to the community. Alongside images that related directly to the event of the earthquakes, the art form of a mosaic was chosen, and consisted of images and symbols that clearly drew on the hopes and dreams of a school community who were refusing to be defined by the disaster. The paper 'writes' the mosaic by placing fragments of speech spoken by the children involved in relation to ideas about memory, affect, and the 'sublime', through the work of Jean-Francois Lyotard.

1306,Factors controlling sediment yield at the catchment scale in NW Mediterranean geoecosystems,"de Vente, Joris; Verduyn, Rubia; Verstraeten, Gert; Vanmaercke, Matthias; Poesen, Jean","Purpose This study aimed to (1) increase understanding of the relation between sediment yield and environmental variables at the catchment scale; (2) test and validate existing and newly developed regression equations for prediction of sediment yield; and (3) identify how better predictions may be obtained. Materials and methods A correlation and regression analysis was performed between sediment yield and over 40 environmental variables for 61 Spanish catchments. Variables were selected based on availability and expected relation with diverse soil erosion and sediment transport processes. For comparison, the Area Relief Temperature (ART) sediment delivery model was applied to the same catchments. Sediment yield estimates obtained from reservoir surveys were used for model calibration and validation. Results and discussion Catchment area, catchment perimeter, stream length, relief ratio, Modified Fournier Index, the RUSLE's R factor, and catchments percentage with poor vegetation cover showed highest correlations with sediment yield. Stepwise linear regression revealed that variables representing topography, climate, vegetation, lithology, and soil characteristics are required for the best prediction equation. Although calibration results were relatively good, validation showed that the models were unstable and not suitable for extrapolation to other catchments. Reasons for this unstable model performance include (1) lack of detail and quality of the data sources; (2) large variation in catchment characteristics; (3) insufficient representation of all relevant erosion and sediment transport processes; and (4) the presence of nonlinear relations between sediment yield and environmental variables. The nonlinear ART model performed relatively well but systematically overpredicted sediment yield. A model reflecting human impacts, including dams and conservation measures, is expected to provide better results. This, however, requires significantly more input data. Conclusions Although important insight is obtained into the relation between sediment yield and environmental factors, prediction of sediment yield at the catchment scale requires alternative approaches. More detailed information is required on land cover (change), and the effect of soil conservation measures. Validation of regression equations is a necessity, and better predictions are obtained by nonlinear models.",ART model; Mediterranean; Multiple regression; Prediction; Sediment yield; Soil erosion; Spanish reservoirs

The SPP is a major contributor to yield loss in surface mount technology (SMT). Enhancement in SPP performance is critical to improving the printed circuit board (PCB) assembly line. The selection of a solvent-based or a dry-based cleaning profile is challenging, but the choice determines the effectiveness and efficiency of the stencil cleaning operation. The amount of residue buildup under the stencil is the main criterion used to decide the appropriate cleaning profile in SPP. In this research, a multi-dimensional temporal recurrent neural network (RNN) approach is used to accurately predict the amount of residue buildup on the underneath surface of the stencil in real-time. Specifically, the long short-term memory (LSTM) architecture is trained using actual residue buildup data. The proposed LSTM prediction model is compared with other state-of-the-art regression models such as multilayer perceptron (MLP) and ensemble learning models. Experimental results show the proposed LSTM model outperforms the state-of-the-art regression models and accurately predicts the stencil status. The proposed research aids decision-makers in the SPP line to select the appropriate stencil cleaning profile adaptively and in real-time. As a result, the overall SPP performance is improved.",Stencil printing process; Cleaning profile selection; Recurrent neural network (RNN); Long short-term memory (LSTM)

1310,Bidirectional Mapping-Based Domain Adaptation for Nucleus Detection in Cross-Modality Microscopy Images,"Xing, Fuyong; Cornish, Toby C.; Bennett, Tellen D.; Ghosh, Debashis","Cell or nucleus detection is a fundamental task in microscopy image analysis and has recently achieved state-of-the-art performance by using deep neural networks. However, training supervised deep models such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) usually requires sufficient annotated image data, which is prohibitively expensive or unavailable in some applications. Additionally, when applying a CNN to new datasets, it is common to annotate individual cells/nuclei in those target datasets for model re-learning, leading to inefficient and low-throughput image analysis. To tackle these problems, we present a bidirectional, adversarial domain adaptation method for nucleus detection on cross-modality microscopy image data. Specifically, the method learns a deep regression model for individual nucleus detection with both source-to-target and target-to-source image translation. In addition, we explicitly extend this unsupervised domain adaptation method to a semi-supervised learning situation and further boost the nucleus detection performance. We evaluate the proposed method on three cross-modality microscopy image datasets, which cover a wide variety of microscopy imaging protocols or modalities, and obtain a significant improvement in nucleus detection compared to reference baseline approaches. In addition, our semi-supervised method is very competitive with recent fully supervised learning models trained with all real target training labels.",Microscopy; Image segmentation; Training; Adaptation models; Task analysis; Annotations; Data models; Nucleus detection; cell detection; domain adaptation; deep neural networks; generative adversarial networks; microscopy image analysis

However, in specific W power-harvesting applications, the Schottky diode technique fails to provide a satisfactory RF-dc conversion efficiency mainly because of its high zero-bias junction resistance. This paper examines the state-of-the-art low-power microwave-to-dc energy conversion techniques. A comprehensive picture of the state-of-the-art on this aspect is given graphically, which compares different technologies such as transistor, diode, and CMOS schemes. Subsequent to the highlighted limitations of current devices, this work introduces, for the first time, a nonlinear component for low-power rectification based on a recent discovery in spintronics, namely, the spindiode. Along with an analysis of the role of nonlinearity and zero bias resistance in the rectification process of the spindiode, it is shown how the spindiode could enhance the rectification efficiency even at a very low-power level and how this technique would shift the design paradigms of diode-based devices and circuits.",Low-power and high-efficiency energy harvesting; magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ); microwave power transmission; rectifier; Schottky diode; signal detection; spin polarized transport

The major factor responsible for the increased level of pollution is the smaller size of microplastics which helps in its transportation across the globe. It has been found in most remote areas like glaciers and Antarctic regions where it is difficult for other contaminants to reach. This is ensured by the physicochemical cycle of plastic. They can either be produced for different applications or generated through the fragmentation of large plastic particles. Different studies have shown the accumulation of microplastics in different organisms, especially in aquatic animals leading to their entry into the food chain. The ultimate fate of the microplastics is accumulation inside the human body posing the risk of different health conditions like cancer, diabetes, and allergic reactions.

The intermolecular forces governing the assembly of vdW heterostructures are investigated by first-principles models, yet translating the outcome of these models to macroscopic observables in layered crystals is missing. Establishing this connection is, therefore, crucial for ultimately designing advanced materials of choice-tailoring the composition to functional device properties. Herein, components from both vdW and non-vdW forces are integrated to build a comprehensive framework that can quantitatively describe the dynamics of these forces in action. Specifically, it is shown that the optical band gap of layered crystals possesses a peculiar ionic character that works as a quantitative indicator of non-vdW forces. Using these two components, it is then described why only a narrow range of exfoliation energies for this class of materials is observed. These findings unlock the microscopic origin of universal binding energy in layered crystals and provide a general protocol to identify and synthesize new crystals to regulate vdW coupling in the next generation of heterostructures.",2D materials; dielectric function; graphene; van der Waals interactions.

Different clinical pictures can be observed in chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP). Unfortunately, the eradication of the disease is impossible in all cases even if it is performed by experienced surgeons. In a significant number of patients, the polyps may regenerate and symptoms may reappear more or less in different durations. Due to the complex pathophysiology of the disease, revision sinus surgery is accepted as a multifactorial problem. We investigated the possible host and surgical factors which are related to increased frequency and earlier revision surgeries in CRSwNP. Methodology Patients operated on two or more times between 2010 and 2020 were retrospectively identified. A total of 49 patients with CRSwNP (38 male, 11 female) were statistically analyzed. The effects of host and surgical factors on the frequency and duration of revision surgery in CRSwNP were assessed. Results Samter's syndrome was noted to be a significant host factor affecting recurrence and revision surgeries. In addition, we observed significantly more frequent scarring and adhesions in patients with a higher number of operations. Conclusions Patients with Samter's syndrome should be informed of possible revision surgeries.

However, state-of-the-art methods using deep convolutional networks either fail at modeling collisions or are too expensive/slow, making them less suitable for deployment on AV edge hardware. To address these limitations, we propose SG2VEC, a spatiotemporal scene-graph embedding methodology that uses the graph neural network (GNN) and long short-term memory (LSTM) layers to predict future collisions via visual scene perception. We demonstrate that SG2VEC predicts collisions 8.11% more accurately and 39.07% earlier than the state-of-the-art method on synthesized data sets, and 29.47% more accurately on a challenging real-world collision data set. We also show that SG2VEC is better than the state of the art at transferring knowledge from synthetic data sets to real-world driving data sets. Finally, we demonstrate that SG2VEC performs inference 9.3x faster with an 88.0% smaller model, 32.4% less power, and 92.8% less energy than the state-of-the-art method on the industrystandard Nvidia DRIVE PX 2 platform, making it more suitable for implementation on the edge.",ADAS; autonomous vehicles (AVs); collision prediction; graph learning; scene graph

Due to pulsatile heart motions, transverse and longitudinal motions are observed during in vivo pullbacks of IVUS sequences. These motion artifacts can mislead the volume-based data retrieved from IVUS studies and hinder the visualization of the vessel condition. To overcome this problem, a new fully automatic image-based gating algorithm was proposed in the current study. We utilized the phase information of the dual-tree complex wavelet transform (DT-CWT) coefficients to detect the motion of edge-like structures. For each IVUS sequence, first, six motion signals were detected by analyzing the phase of DT-CWT coefficients in six different directions. Then, the three best motion signals were selected by analyzing the frequency properties of each signal. Subsequently, these extracted signals were filtered using a modified Butter worth band-pass filter and the gated sequence was formed by using a combination of them. The proposed method was compared to four state-of-the-art methods and its frequency spectrum had more accurate characteristics in the cardiac frequency. In addition, the gated sequence extracted by the proposed method had the highest similarity to the extracted gated sequence by the physician.",Ultrasound; motion detection; image-based gating; IVUS

Grammatical Evolution has been used as the meta-evolutionary algorithm in MeSCEDE to search the space of design choices so as to evolve effective ensemble design(s) for given problem(s). The simulation experiments carried out in this paper involve applying MeSCEDE to evolve ensemble DE designs for solving 30-dimensional CEC'17 benchmark functions. The effectiveness of the evolved designs are validated on 30 and 50-dimensional CEC'14 functions as well as on 22 real-world problem instances from CEC'11 benchmark suite. The MeSCEDE evolved designs have exhibited a competitive performance against state-of-the-art ensemble DE algorithms. In addition, the potential of MeSCEDE has been demonstrated against irace, a state-of-the-art algorithm configurator. All simulation experiments reiterate the potential of MeSCEDE towards evolving effective and robust ensemble DE designs.",Automated algorithm design; Grammatical evolution; Ensemble differential evolution; Parameter tuning; Meta evolutionary approach

L.","This paper proposes a novel light field image compression approach with viewpoint scalability and random access functionalities. Although current state-of-the-art image coding algorithms for light fields already achieve high compression ratios, there is a lack of support for such functionalities, which are important for ensuring compatibility with different displays/capturing devices, enhanced user interaction and low decoding delay. The proposed solution enables various encoding profiles with different flexible viewpoint scalability and random access capabilities, depending on the application scenario. When compared to other state-of-the-art methods, the proposed approach consistently presents higher bitrate savings (44% on average), namely when compared to pseudo-video sequence coding approach based on HEVC. Moreover, the proposed scalable codec also outperforms MuLE and WaSP verification models, achieving average bitrate saving gains of 37% and 47%, respectively. The various flexible encoding profiles proposed add fine control to the image prediction dependencies, which allow to exploit the tradeoff between coding efficiency and the viewpoint random access, consequently, decreasing the maximum random access penalties that range from 0.60 to 0.15, for lenslet and HDCA light fields.",Light field image coding; Viewpoint scalability; Viewpoint random access; HEVC
1321,Comparison of three techniques for analysis of data from an Aerosol Time-of-Flight Mass Spectrometer,"Giorio, Chiara; Tapparo, Andrea; Dall'Osto, Manuel; Harrison, Roy M.; Beddows, David C. S.; Di Marco, Chiara; Nemitz, Eiko","The Aerosol Time-of-Flight Mass Spectrometer (ATOFMS) is one of few instruments able to measure the size and mass spectra of individual airborne particles with high temporal resolution. Data analysis is challenging and in the present study, we apply three different techniques (PMF. ART-2a and K-means) to a regional ATOFMS dataset collected at Harwell, UK. For the first time, Positive Matrix Factorization (PMF) was directly applied to single particle mass spectra as opposed to clusters already generated by the other methods. The analysis was performed on a total of 56,898 single particle mass spectra allowing the extraction of 10 factors, their temporal trends and size distributions, named CNO-COOH (cyanide, oxidized organic nitrogen and carboxylic acids), SUL (sulphate), NH4-OOA (ammonium and oxidized organic aerosol), NaCl, EC+ (elemental carbon positive fragments), OC-Arom (aromatic organic carbon), EC- (elemental carbon negative fragments), K (potassium), NIT (nitrate) and OC-CHNO (organic nitrogen). The 10 factor solution from single particle PMF analysis explained 45% of variance of the total dataset, but the factors are well defined from a chemical point of view. Different EC and OC components were separated: fresh EC (factor EC) from aged EC (factor EC+) and different organic families (factors NH4-OOA, OC-Arom, OC CHNO and CNO-COOH). A comparison was conducted between PMF, K-means cluster analysis and the ART-2a artificial neural network. K-means and ART-2a give broadly overlapping results (with 9 clusters, each describing the full composition of a particle type), while PMF, by effecting spectral deconvolution, was able to extract and separate the different chemical species contributing to particles, but loses some information on internal mixing. Relationships were also examined between the estimated volumes of ATOFMS PMF factors and species concentrations measured independently by GRAEGOR and AMS instruments, showing generally moderate to strong correlations.

Rapid and accurate icing detection allows proper control of wind turbines, including shutting down and clearing the ice, thus ensuring turbine safety. This article presents a wavelet-driven multiscale graph convolutional network (MWGCN), which is a supervised deep learning model for blade icing detection. The proposed model first uses wavelet decomposition to capture multivariate information in the time and frequency domains, and then employs a temporal graph convolutional network (GCN) to model the intervariable correlations of the decomposed multiscale wavelets and their temporal dynamics. In addition, this article introduces scale attention to the MWGCN for a further improvement of the model and proposes the method to address the class imbalance problem of the training data sets. Finally, the article conducts comprehensive experiments to evaluate the proposed model, and the results demonstrate the effectiveness of the model in blade icing detection and its better performance over eight state-of-the-art algorithms, with 17.2% and 11.3% higher F1 scores over the best state-of-the-art baseline on the labeled datasets.",Blades; Wind turbines; Data models; Wavelet domain; Correlation; Ice; Mathematical models; Graph convolutional network (GCN); time series classification; wavelet transform; wind turbine

However, our previous study described the dose-dependent adverse effects of TA on immune responses and growth in chickens. In this study, we evaluated the protective effects of a probiotic preparation (BT) consisting of three different bacteria (Bacillus mesenteric, Clostridium butyricum, and Streptococcus faecalis) against TA-induced immunosuppression in chickens. Forty chicks were divided into 4 groups as follows: the CON group (basal diet), BT group supplemented with 3 g BT/kg diet, tannic acid (TA) group supplemented with 30 g TA/kg diet, and BT+TA group supplemented with 3 g BT/kg diet + 30 g TA/kg diet. The feeding trial lasted for 35 days. Lymphocyte subset, macrophage phagocytosis, cytokine mRNA expression, and primary and secondary IgY immune responses were evaluated. BT supplementation significantly improved TA-induced reductions in final body weight, body weight gain, feed intake, and relative weights of lymphoid organs compared with the TA group. Furthermore, in the spleen and cecal tonsil (CT), the relative populations of CD4+, CD8+, and CD4+CD8+ cells in the BT+TA group were significantly ameliorated compared with the TA group. Additionally, comparison with the TA group showed that the chickens in the BT+TA group had an improved relative population of B cells in the CT and that macrophage phagocytosis in the spleen was significantly increased. Chickens in the BT+TA group showed significant increases in IFN-γ and IL-4 mRNA expression in the spleen compared with the TA group. The primary and secondary IgY responses were significantly improved. These results revealed that supplementation with BT protects against TA-induced immunosuppression in chickens.",chicken; growth performance; immunity; probiotics; tannin.

1327,Guided Soft Attention Network for Classification of Breast Cancer Histopathology Images,"Yang, Heechan; Kim, Ji-Ye; Kim, Hyongsuk; Adhikari, Shyam P.","An attention guided convolutional neural network (CNN) for the classification of breast cancer histopathology images is proposed. Neural networks are generally applied as black box models and often the network's decisions are difficult to interpret. Making the decision process transparent, and hence reliable is important for a computer-assisted diagnosis (CAD) system. Moreover, it is crucial that the network's decision be based on histopathological features that are in agreement with a human expert. To this end, we propose to use additional region-level supervision for the classification of breast cancer histopathology images using CNN, where the regions of interest (RoI) are localized and used to guide the attention of the classification network simultaneously. The proposed supervised attention mechanism specifically activates neurons in diagnostically relevant regions while suppressing activations in irrelevant and noisy areas. The class activation maps generated by the proposed method correlate well with the expectations of an expert pathologist. Moreover, the proposed method surpasses the state-of-the-art on the BACH microscopy test dataset (part A) with a significant margin.",Breast cancer; Microscopy; Noise measurement; Neural networks; Pathology; Training; Task analysis; Breast cancer; microscopy image; convolutional neural network; guided attention; pattern recognition and classification

Mn oxides are primarily produced by bacterial processes using Mn oxidases. However, the molecular mechanism underlying the formation of rhizosphere Mn oxides is still largely unknown. This study identified a manganese-oxidizing enzyme, the catalase-peroxidase StKatG, from an endophytic bacterium Salinicola tamaricis from the wetland plant. The gene encoding StKatG was cloned and overexpressed in Escherichia coli. The recombinant StKatG displayed different structure and enzymatic properties from the previously reported Mn oxidases. The enzyme activity of StKatG yielded Mn oxides with the mixed-valent state: Mn(II), Mn(III), and Mn(IV). The optimum pH and temperature for StKatG are 7.5 and 50 °C, respectively. Structurally, StKatG is organized into two domains, whereas the reported Mn oxidases are mainly single-domain proteins. Based on the site-directed mutagenesis studies, the presence of aspartic acid (Asp) residues in the loop of StKatG are critical to Mn-oxidizing activity. These findings identified a novel bacterial Mn oxidase and provided insights into the molecular mechanism of Mn oxidation in the plant rhizosphere.",Biogenic manganese oxides; Endophytic bacteria; Haem peroxidases; Manganese-oxidizing bacteria; Mn(II) oxidation.

However, the rising connectivity exposes a defenseless internal Controller Area Network (CAN) to cyberattacks. An Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is a supervisory module, proposed for identifying CAN network malicious messages, without modifying legacy ECUs and causing high traffic overhead. The traditional IDS approaches rely on time and frequency thresholding, leading to high false alarm rates, whereas state-of-the-art solutions may suffer from vehicle dependency. This paper presents a wavelet-based approach to locating the behavior change in the CAN traffic by analyzing the CAN network's transmission pattern. The proposed Wavelet-based Intrusion Detection System (WINDS) is tested on various attack scenarios, using real vehicle traffic from two independent research centers, while being expanded toward more comprehensive attack scenarios using synthetic attacks. The technique is evaluated and compared against the state-of-the-art solutions and the baseline frequency method. Experimental results show that WINDS offers a vehicle-independent solution applicable for various vehicles through a unique approach while generating low false alarms.",Intrusion detection; Wavelet transforms; Wavelet analysis; Continuous wavelet transforms; Protocols; Time-frequency analysis; Training; Controller area network; intrusion detection; in-vehicle network; wavelet analysis

Moreover, thymoquinone (TQ) has therapeutic potential as antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antibacterial and anticancer. Therefore, we investigated the effects of both sodium nitrite and TQ on testicular tissues of rats. Forty adult male Sprague Dawley rats were used. They received either 80 mg kg(-1) sodium nitrite or 50 mg kg(-1) TQ daily for twelve weeks. Serum testosterone was measured. Testis were weighed and the testicular tissue homogenates were used for measurements of tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-4, IL-6, IL10, caspase-3, caspase-8 and caspase-9. Sodium nitrite resulted in significant reduction in serum testosterone concentration and elevation in testis weight and Gonado-Somatic Index. We found significant reduction in testicular tissues levels of IL-4 and IL-10 associated with elevated levels of TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, caspase-3, caspase-8 and caspase-9. In conclusion, chronic oral sodium nitrite induced changes in the weight of rat testis accompanied by elevation in the testicular tissue level of oxidative stress markers and inflammatory cytokines.

1331,A low-granularity classifier for data streams with concept drifts and biased class distribution,"Wang, Peng; Wang, Haixun; Wu, Xiaochen; Wang, Wei; Shi, Baile","Many applications track streaming data for actionable alerts, which may include, for example, network intrusions, transaction frauds, bio-surveilence abnormalities, and so forth. Some stream classification models are built for this purpose. Due to concept drifts, maintaining a model's up-to-dateness has become one of the most challenging tasks in mining data streams. State-of-the-art approaches, including both the incrementally updated classifiers and the ensemble classifiers, have proved that model update is a very costly process. In this paper, we show that reducing model granularity reduces the update cost, as models of fine granularity enable us to efficiently pinpoint local components in the model that are affected by the concept drift. It also enables us to derive new model components to reflect the current data distribution, thus avoiding expensive updates on a global scale. Furthermore, those actionable alerts being monitored are usually rare occurrences. The existing stream classifiers cannot handle this problem. We address this problem and show that the low-granularity classifier handles rare events on stream data with ease. Experiments on real and synthetic data show that our approach is able to maintain good prediction accuracy at a fraction of the model updating cost of state-of-the-art approaches.",classification; data stream; concept drift; association rule

Revealing the viscosity fluctuations of ER during ferroptosis is of great significance not only to monitor the occurrence and development of iron poisoning, but also to deeply understand the biological effects of ER in ferroptosis. Herein, we present an ER-targeting fluorescent probe (PV1) to detect viscosity changes of ER during ferroptosis. PV1 utilized a rotatable C-C bond to connect the two rigid π-systems, and responded viscosity by the regulation of the coplanarity of these two planes. PV1 displayed desirable sensitivity and selectivity to viscosity. The biological imaging results suggested that PV1 mainly distributed at ER in live cells, and the viscosity of ER exhibited an evident increase in the process of erastin-induced ferroptosis. After the simultaneous incubation of cells with erastin and Fer-1 or VE, the viscosity of ER showed no marked change, and it suggested that the erastin-induced ferroptosis could be inhibited by Fer-1 and VE. We expect that the developed probe could provide a feasible and rapid method for the in-depth study of the ferroptosis-based disease treatment and drug design.",Endoplasmic reticulum; Ferroptosis; Fluorescence imaging; Viscosity.

Unlike state-of-the-art Graph Convolutional Neural Network (GCNN) models, the proposed QSGCNN model incorporates the process of identifying transitive aligned vertices between graphs and transforms arbitrary sized graphs into fixed-sized aligned vertex grid structures. In order to learn representative graph characteristics, a new quantum spatial graph convolution is proposed and employed to extract multi-scale vertex features, in terms of quantum information propagation between grid vertices of each graph. Since the quantum spatial convolution preserves the grid structures of the input vertices (i.e., the convolution layer does not alter the original spatial position of vertices), the proposed QSGCNN model allows to directly employ the traditional convolutional neural network architecture to further learn from the global graph topology, providing an end-to-end deep learning architecture that integrates the graph representation and learning in the quantum spatial graph convolution layer and the traditional convolutional layer for graph classifications. We indicate the effectiveness of the proposed QSGCNN model in relation to existing state-of-the-art methods.

Most of these systems incorporate smartness for intelligent decision making using artificial intelligence (AI) approaches. To reduce the network bandwidth usage and load on the cloud server, there is a push to relegate most of these AI-related computations to edge IoT devices/systems. Hence, to ensure good performance, the edge devices must be systematically designed with an emphasis on the respective AI requirements from exploration to deployment. State-of-the-art IoT device and system design practices place little importance on the AI specifications during the early stages of the system development resulting in systems, which are unable to meet the AI specifications without additional redesigning and optimization efforts.

This method uses the extreme value theory to model the feature distribution of the images without a pathology and use it to identify positive instances of an imaged pathology. The experimental results, on three separate image classification tasks (i.e. classify retinal OCT images according to the presence or absence of fluid build-ups, emphysema detection in pulmonary 3D-CT images and detection of cancerous regions in 2D histopathology images) show that the proposed method produces classifiers that have similar performance to fully supervised methods and achieves the state of the art performance in all examined test cases.",Multiple instance learning; weakly supervised learning; CNN; OCT; CT; Macular Edema; emphysema; COPD

Recently, residual interpolation (RI)-based algorithms have demonstrated superior demosaicking performance over conventional color difference interpolation-based algorithms.

These are performed based on a unified criterion that evaluates the validity of an RI-based algorithm. Experimental comparisons using standard color image datasets demonstrate that ARI can improve existing RI-based algorithms by more than 0.6 dB in the color peak signal-to-noise ratio and can outperform state-of-the-art algorithms based on training images. We further extend ARI for a multispectral filter array, in which more than three spectral bands are arrayed, and demonstrate that ARI can achieve state-of-the-art performance also for the task of multispectral image demosaicking.",image sensor; Bayer color filter array; multispectral filter array; demosaicking; residual interpolation

Conclusion: The absence of kits for the detection of these arboviruses in Aedes is a limiting factor and the adequacy of commercial kits, already used for the diagnosis of arboviruses in humans, the results presented demonstrate that it is possible to identify the presence of DENV2 in mosquitoes with the respective kit, reinforcing the use of RT-qPCR as a robust diagnostic tool for epidemiological surveillance allowing managers to receive timely results for decision-making regarding prevention and control actions.",RT-qPCR; arboviruses; epidemiological surveillance; mosquitoes; one health.
1344,How can the UK statutory Cryptosporidium monitoring be used for Quantitative Risk Assessment of Cryptosporidium in drinking water?,"Smeets, P. W. M. H.; van Dijk, J. C.; Stanfield, G.; Rietveld, L. C.; Medema, G. J.","Quantitative Microbiological Risk Assessment (QMRA) is increasingly being used to complement traditional verification of drinking water safety through the absence of indicator bacteria. However, the full benefit of QMRA is often not achieved because of a lack of appropriate data on the fate and behaviour of pathogens. In the UK statutory monitoring for Cryptosporidium has, provided a unique dataset of pathogens directly measured in large volumes of treated drinking water. Using this data a QMRA was performed to determine the benefits and limitations of such state-of-the-art monitoring for risk assessment. Estimates of the risk of infection at the 216 assessed treatment sites ranged from 10(-6.5) to 10(-2.5) person(-1) d(-1). In addition, Cryptosporidium monitoring data in source water was collected at eight treatment sites to determine how Cryptosporidium removal could be quantified for QMRA purposes. Cryptosporidium removal varied from 1.8 to 5.2 log units and appeared to be related to source water Cryptosporidium concentration. Application of general removal credits can either over- or underestimate Cryptosporidium removal by full-scale sedimentation and filtration. State-of-the-art pathogen monitoring can identify poorly performing systems, although it is ineffective to verify drinking water safety to the level of 10(-4) infections person(-1) yr(-1).",Cryptosporidium; drinking water; QMRA; risk assessment; statutory monitoring; treatment

To make a WNY painting involves carving images on woodblocks and printing colors using woodblocks. Although thousands of WNY paintings were preserved, the ten-year national survey reveals that a great number of woodblocks were damaged or lost. In this paper, we study a novel problem of decomposing woodblock images from WNY paintings, which currently requires a tremendous amount of manual labor. We also find that the state-of-the-art methods of natural image segmentation generate poor results in our application. Instead of using sophisticated schemes, we develop a simple yet robust decomposition approach, which contains the extraction of line block image and the separation of color block images. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is validated through both quantitative evaluation and visual quality comparison with six state-of-the-art methods on multiple WNY paintings.",Woodblock printed Chinese new year paintings; Woodblock image decomposition; Line block; Color block
1346,Deep Learning for Natural Language Parsing,"Jaf, Sardar; Calder, Calum","Natural language processing problems (such as speech recognition, text-based data mining, and text or speech generation) are becoming increasingly important. Before effectively approaching many of these problems, it is necessary to process the syntactic structures of the sentences. Syntactic parsing is the task of constructing a syntactic parse tree over a sentence which describes the structure of the sentence. Parse trees are used as part of many language processing applications. In this paper, we present a multi-lingual dependency parser. Using advanced deep learning techniques, our parser architecture tackles common issues with parsing such as long-distance head attachment, while using 'architecture engineering' to adapt to each target language in order to reduce the feature engineering often required for parsing tasks. We implement a parser based on this architecture to utilize transfer learning techniques to address important issues related with limited-resourced language. We exceed the accuracy of state-of-the-art parsers on languages with limited training resources by a considerable margin. We present promising results for solving core problems in natural language parsing, while also performing at state-of-the-art accuracy on general parsing tasks.",BiLSTM parsing; deep learning; dependency parsing; natural language processing; parsers; shift-reduce parsing; syntactic parsing; transition-based parsing

However, the uncontrollable dendrite growth and infinite volume change of lithium seriously hinder the real-world implementation of lithium-based batteries. Herein, a flexible MXene@iodine-doped red phosphorus (MXene@RP) paper with iodine-doped red phosphorous particles evenly distributed on the surface and interlayer of MXene matrix is designed by a simple vapor condensation reduction approach. The MXene@RP paper can be used as an efficient matrix to enable dendrite-free lithium deposition. On the one hand, the iodine doping alleviates the low conductivity shortcoming of red phosphorus, making it facilitate homogeneous lithium nucleation, thus promoting uniform lithium deposition and suppressing dendrite growth. On the other hand, the unique layered structure of conductive MXene paper provides ion transport channels and free spaces for lithium loading, alleviating the volume change induced structural damage. As a result, the MXene@RP paper with preloaded lithium exhibits long-term cycling stability. Particularly, a full cell based on Li-MXene@RP anode can maintain 81.4% of the initial capacity after 600 cycles at 4 C. The MXene@RP-based anode increases the potential applications of MXene and provides a guide for the design of dendrite-free lithium hosts.",Li metal anodes; MXene; free spaces; lithium dendrites; red phosphorus.

Thiocyanate-forming protein (TFP) from field-penny cress, Thlaspi arvense (Brassicaceae), is a representative of specifier proteins, a group of kelch proteins involved in plant specialized metabolism. As components of the glucosinolate-myrosinase system of the Brassicaceae, specifier proteins determine the profile of bioactive products formed when plant tissue is disrupted and glucosinolates are hydrolyzed by myrosinases. Here, we describe the crystal structure of TaTFP at a resolution of 1.4 Å. TaTFP crystallized as homodimer. Each monomer forms a six-blade β-propeller with a wide ""top"" and a narrower ""bottom"" opening with distinct strand-connecting loops protruding far beyond the lower propeller surface. Molecular modeling and mutational analysis identified residues for glucosinolate aglucone and Fe(2+) cofactor binding within these loops. As the first experimentally determined structure of a plant kelch protein, the crystal structure of TaTFP not only enables more detailed mechanistic studies on glucosinolate breakdown product formation, but also provides a new basis for research on the diverse roles and mechanisms of other kelch proteins in plants.",Glucosinolate breakdown; Glucosinolate hydrolysis; Kelch motif; Molecular modeling; Site-directed mutagenesis; Specifier protein.
1349,Supervoxel-Based Segmentation of Mitochondria in EM Image Stacks With Learned Shape Features,"Lucchi, Aurelien; Smith, Kevin; Achanta, Radhakrishna; Knott, Graham; Fua, Pascal","It is becoming increasingly clear that mitochondria play an important role in neural function. Recent studies show mitochondrial morphology to be crucial to cellular physiology and synaptic function and a link between mitochondrial defects and neuro-degenerative diseases is strongly suspected. Electron microscopy (EM), with its very high resolution in all three directions, is one of the key tools to look more closely into these issues but the huge amounts of data it produces make automated analysis necessary. State-of-the-art computer vision algorithms designed to operate on natural 2-D images tend to perform poorly when applied to EM data for a number of reasons. First, the sheer size of a typical EM volume renders most modern segmentation schemes intractable. Furthermore, most approaches ignore important shape cues, relying only on local statistics that easily become confused when confronted with noise and textures inherent in the data. Finally, the conventional assumption that strong image gradients always correspond to object boundaries is violated by the clutter of distracting membranes. In this work, we propose an automated graph partitioning scheme that addresses these issues. It reduces the computational complexity by operating on supervoxels instead of voxels, incorporates shape features capable of describing the 3-D shape of the target objects, and learns to recognize the distinctive appearance of true boundaries. Our experiments demonstrate that our approach is able to segment mitochondria at a performance level close to that of a human annotator, and outperforms a state-of-the-art 3-D segmentation technique.",Electron microscopy (EM); mitochondria; segmentation; shape features; supervoxels

In the present work, we report the creation of a new model catalytic support based on the surface functionalization of different silica bilayer (BL) polymorphs with well-defined atomic structures. The functionalization is carried out by means of in situ H-plasma treatments at room temperature. Low energy electron diffraction and microscopy data indicate that the atomic structure of the films remains unchanged upon treatment. Comparing the experimental results (photoemission and infrared absorption spectra) with density functional theory simulations shows that H2 is added via the heterolytic dissociation of an interlayer Si-O-Si siloxane bond and the subsequent formation of a hydroxyl and a hydride group in the top and bottom layers of the silica film, respectively. Functionalization of the silica films constitutes the first step into the development of a new type of model system of single-atom catalysts where metal atoms with different affinities for the functional groups can be anchored in the SiO2 matrix in well-established positions. In this way, synergistic and confinement effects between the active centers can be studied in a controlled manner.",crystalline; hydride; hydroxyl; plasma functionalization; ultrathin silica film; vitreous.

As depression has received more attention in recent years, it has become imperative to develop automatic methods for detecting depression. Although numerous machine learning methods have been proposed for estimating the levels of depression via audio, visual, and audiovisual emotion sensing, several challenges still exist. For example, it is difficult to extract long-term temporal context information from long sequences of audio and visual data, and it is also difficult to select and fuse useful multi-modal information or features effectively. In addition, how to include other information or tasks to enhance the estimation accuracy is also one of the challenges. In this study, we propose a multi-modal adaptive fusion transformer network for estimating the levels of depression. Transformer-based models have achieved state-of-the-art performance in language understanding and sequence modeling. Thus, the proposed transformer-based network is utilized to extract long-term temporal context information from uni-modal audio and visual data in our work. This is the first transformer-based approach for depression detection. We also propose an adaptive fusion method for adaptively fusing useful multi-modal features. Furthermore, inspired by current multi-task learning work, we also incorporate an auxiliary task (depression classification) to enhance the main task of depression level regression (estimation). The effectiveness of the proposed method has been validated on a public dataset (AVEC 2019 Detecting Depression with AI Sub-challenge) in terms of the PHQ-8 scores. Experimental results indicate that the proposed method achieves better performance compared with currently state-of-the-art methods. Our proposed method achieves a concordance correlation coefficient (CCC) of 0.733 on AVEC 2019 which is 6.2% higher than the accuracy (CCC = 0.696) of the state-of-the-art method.",depression detection; transformer; multi-modal; audio-visual; adaptive fusion; multi-task; regression; classification; PHQ-8 score
1352,Time-to-Live Caching With Network Delays: Exact Analysis and Computable Approximations,"Elsayed, Karim; Rizk, Amr","We consider Time-to-Live (TTL) caches that tag every object in cache with a specific (and possibly renewable) expiration time. State-of-the-art models for TTL caches assume zero object fetch delay, i.e., the time required to fetch a requested object that is not in cache from a different cache or the origin server. Particularly, in cache hierarchies this delay has a significant impact on performance metrics such as the object hit probability. Recent work suggests that the impact of the object fetch delay on the cache performance will continue to increase due to the scaling mismatch between shrinking inter-request times (due to higher data center link rates) in contrast to processing and memory access times. In this paper, we analyze tree-based cache hierarchies with random object fetch delays and provide an exact analysis of the corresponding object hit probability. Our analysis allows understanding the impact of random delays and TTLs on cache metrics for a wide class of request stream models characterized through Markov arrival processes. This is expressed through a metric that we denote delay impairment of the hit probability. In addition, we analyze and extend state-of-the-art approximations of the hit probability to take the delay into account. We provide numerical and trace-based simulation-based evaluation results showing that larger TTLs do not efficiently compensate the detrimental effect of object fetch delays. Our evaluations also show that unlike our exact model the state-of-the-art approximations do not capture the impact of the object fetch delay well especially for cache hierarchies. Surprisingly, we show for single caches that the impact of the delay on the hit probability can be non-monotonic and that the range of delays for which a positive effect exists arises as a root of a polynomial in the ratio of the expected TTL to the expected inter-request time.",Delays; Measurement; Analytical models; Markov processes; Internet; IEEE transactions; Behavioral sciences; Caching under network delays; TTL caching; Markov arrival processes
1353,The Affective Domain-A Program to Foster Social-Emotional Orientation in Novice Physical Education Teachers,"Zach, Sima; Rosenblum, Hily","The present study aimed to assess the influence of an emotional-based program for novice physical education teachers on their perception of the affective domain in teaching, and the influence of the program on their social-emotional orientation. Thirty-two physical educators in their induction year participated. Instrumentations included reflective assignments: individual tasks, a group artwork task, short videos containing student-teacher scenarios, and summary reflections. The study covered tasks that contained a variety of emotional expressions-verbalizing, acting, and art creation. Content analysis was conducted for each of the assignments. The results indicate that the participants felt that they gradually developed an awareness of the role of emotions in their practice. In addition to personal gain, they felt that their empathy for others-especially their students-was enhanced. These results highlight the important influence that an emotional-based program has on physical educators' social-emotional orientation.",social-emotional orientation; physical education; professional development program; personal development

Using pooled data from two phase three studies (VANISH 303 and 306) in the treatment of acute VVC, this analysis sought to determine the effectiveness of ibrexafungerp in various patient subgroups that may impact outcomes. Materials and Methods: Data from VANISH 303 (NCT03734991) and VANISH 306 (NCT03987620) evaluating ibrexafungerp 300 mg twice daily (BID) for 1 day versus placebo, were pooled and analyzed to determine clinical cure rate, clinical improvement, and mycological cure at the test-of-cure visit (day 11 ± 3) and symptom resolution at the follow-up visit (day 25 ± 4) in the overall population. Patient subgroups analyzed included race, body mass index (BMI), baseline vulvovaginal signs and symptoms (VSS) score, and Candida species. Results: At the test-of-cure visit, patients receiving ibrexafungerp, compared with those who received placebo, had significantly higher rates of clinical cure (56.9% [214/376 patients] vs. 35.7% [65/182 patients]), clinical improvement (68.4% [257/376 patients] vs. 45.1% [82/182 patients]), and mycological cure (54.0% [203/376 patients] vs. 24.2% [44/182 patients]; all p < 0.0001). At the follow-up visit, patients receiving ibrexafungerp had sustained responses with higher symptom resolution rates (66.8% [251/376 patients]) versus placebo (48.4% [88/182 patients]; p < 0.0001). Race, BMI, baseline VSS score (including VSS severity score 13-18), and Candida species infection did not adversely affect clinical cure rates. Safety analysis results were consistent with the individual studies. Conclusions: Ibrexafungerp provides a safe and well-tolerated first-in-class fungicidal, 1-day oral treatment for patients with acute VVC, the first new therapy in >20 years.

A systematic literature review,"Lize Duminy,Vanessa Ress,Eva-Maria Wild,Lize Duminy,Vanessa Ress,Eva-Maria Wild","Preventing hospitalizations due to ambulatory care sensitive conditions (ACSCs) is traditionally the responsibility of primary care. The determinants of ACSC hospitalizations, however, are not purely medical, but also influenced by other factors like patients' social and personal circumstances. Interventions that include or consist entirely of community health services and social care could potentially reduce the ACSC hospitalization rate. Comparisons of the features of successful interventions of this nature, however, are still lacking. We therefore conducted a systematic review of the literature to identify out-of-hospital interventions that (a) included aspects or consisted entirely of community health services and social care and (b) analyzed the ACSC hospitalization rate as an outcome measure. We identified papers reporting the results of 32 interventions and extracted structural and behavioral features to determine which of these were shared by most or all of the successful interventions. We found that all of the successful interventions included a primary care physician and provided care management. Moreover, most of the successful interventions were characterized by a high degree of interconnectedness between professional groups and provided care within so-called health care homes. We also identified a set of care coordination activities that were implemented in most of the successful interventions. Policy makers may wish to consider adopting these features when designing interventions that aim to reduce the ACSC hospitalization rate.",Ambulatory care sensitive condition; Community health services; Intervention features; Social care; Systematic literature review.

Actinoporins are potent cytolysins that were first detected in the venom of sea anemones; however, they are occasionally found in animals other than cnidarians and are expanded in a few predatory gastropods. Here, we report the presence of 27 unique actinoporin-like genes with monophyletic origin in Mytilus galloprovincialis, which we have termed mytiporins. These mytiporins exhibited a remarkable level of molecular diversity and gene presence-absence variation, which warranted further studies aimed at elucidating their functional role. We structurally and functionally characterized mytiporin-1 and found significant differences from the archetypal actinoporin fragaceatoxin C. Mytiporin-1 showed weaker permeabilization activity, no specificity towards sphingomyelin, and weak activity in model lipid systems with negatively charged lipids. In contrast to fragaceatoxin C, which forms octameric pores, functional mytiporin-1 pores on negatively charged lipid membranes were hexameric. Similar hexameric pores were observed for coluporin-26 from Cumia reticulata and a conoporin from Conus andremenezi. This indicates that also other molluscan actinoporin-like proteins differ from fragaceatoxin C. Although the functional role of mytiporins in the context of molluscan physiology remains to be elucidated, the lineage-specific gene family expansion event that characterizes mytiporins indicates that strong selective forces acted on their molecular diversification. Given the tissue distribution of mytiporins, this process may have broadened the taxonomic breadth of their biological targets, which would have important implications for digestive processes or mucosal immunity.",Mytilus galloprovincialis; actinoporin-like proteins; actinoporins; mytiporins; pore-forming toxins; protein pores.

1358,A Joint Framework for Denoising and Estimating Diffusion Kurtosis Tensors Using Multiple Prior Information,"Guo, Li; Lyu, Jian; Zhang, Zhe; Shi, Jinping; Feng, Qianjin; Feng, Yanqiu; Gao, Mingyong; Zhang, Xinyuan","Diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI) has been shown to be valuable in a wide range of neuroscientific and clinical applications. However, reliable estimation of DKI tensors is often compromised by noise, especially for the kurtosis tensor (KT). Here, we propose a joint denoising and estimating framework that integrates multiple sources of prior information, including nonlocal structural self-similarity (NSS), local spatial smoothness (LSS), physical relevance (PR) of the DKI model, and noise characteristics of magnitude diffusion MRI (dMRI) images for improved estimation of DKI tensors. The local and nonlocal spatial smoothing constraints are complementary to each other, making the proposed framework highly effective in reducing the noise fluctuations on DKI tensors, especially KT. As an additional refinement, we propose to impose a physically relevant constraint within our joint denoising and estimation framework. We further adopt the first-moment noise-corrected fitting model ((MNCM)-N-1) to remove the noncentral chi-distribution noise bias. The effectiveness of integrating multiple sources of priors into the joint framework is verified by comparing the proposed (MNCM)-N-1-NSS-LSS-PR method with various versions of (MNCM)-N-1-based estimators and two state-of-the-art methods. Results show that the proposed method outperformed the compared methods in simulations and in-vivo dMRI datasets of both spatially stationary and nonstationary noise distributions. The in-vivo experiments also show that the proposed (MNCM)-N-1-NSS-LSS-PR method was robust to the number of diffusion directions.",Diffusion kurtosis imaging; noncentral chi-distribution noise; parameter estimation; prior information
1359,Improving the Performance and Energy Efficiency of GPGPU Computing through Integrated Adaptive Cache Management,"Kim, Kyu Yeun; Park, Jinsu; Baek, Woongki","Hardware caches are widely employed in GPGPUs to achieve higher performance and energy efficiency. Incorporating hardware caches in GPGPUs, however, does not immediately guarantee enhanced performance and energy efficiency due to high cache contention and thrashing. To address the inefficiency of GPGPU caches, various adaptive techniques (e.g., warp limiting) have been proposed. However, relatively little work has been done in the context of creating an architectural framework that tightly integrates adaptive cache management techniques and investigating their effectiveness and interaction. To bridge this gap, we propose IACM, integrated adaptive cache management for high-performance and energy-efficient GPGPU computing. IACM integrates the state-of-the-art adaptive cache management techniques (i.e., cache indexing, bypassing, and warp limiting) in a unified architectural framework. Our quantitative evaluation demonstrates that IACM significantly improves the performance and energy efficiency of various GPGPU workloads over the baseline architecture (i.e., 98.1 and 61.9 percent on average, respectively), achieves considerably higher performance than the state-of-the-art technique (i.e., 361.4 percent at maximum and 7.7 percent on average), and delivers significant performance and energy-efficiency gains over the baseline GPGPU architecture enhanced with advanced architectural technologies.",Integrated adaptive cache management; GPGPU computing; high performance; energy efficiency

Methods: This retrospective study including 1735 patients with LSCC was conducted from January 2005 to December 2010, which were categorized into 4 groups, NSNA group, smoking only group, alcohol-drinking only group, and SA group. We compared overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) using the Kaplan-Meier method and indicated clinicopathological features by Cox proportional hazards regression models before and after propensity score matching (PSM). Results: A total of 415 patients (23.92%) were identified as NSNA. The SA group was predominantly patients ≤60 years old (46.63%) while the NSNA group was more older (58.07%). NSNA group was more likely to present at earlier disease stage and more female. No significant difference in OS (P = .685) and DFS (P = .976) was found between the 2 groups. In addition to age and recurrence and metastasis being common independent prognostic factors in terms of OS in both groups of patients, NSNA group also exhibited other factors, namely tumor area >3.7 cm2 and positive resection margin. For DFS, N + stage, tumor size >3.7 cm2, and positive resection margin were prognostic features specific to NSNA group. Conclusion: The outcome is similar in LSCC patients with and without SA. NSNA group shows a distinct profile from that found in SA group. Clinicopathological features from NSNA group should be considered for LSCC management.",epidemiological feature; laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma; non-alcohol drinking; non-smoking; oncological outcome.

SVC offers the advantage of scalable (layered) coding, but has the disadvantage of a highly increased computational complexity at the encoder side when dealing with spatial scalability. To restrict the increase in required processing power, fast mode decision models for spatial enhancement layers have been proposed in literature. We propose a novel generic fast mode decision model for spatial enhancement layers for both P and B frames based on both the quantization of the enhancement layer and the correlation between the macroblock type in the enhancement layer and the co-located macroblock in the reference layer. In this paper, an evaluation of the proposed model and comparison with a state-of-the-art model is given. Results show that the proposed technique performs exceptionally well for spatial scalability. For both dyadic and non-dyadic spatial scalability, we achieve an average time saving of 75%, while only a slight bit rate increase of 2.23% and a minor PSNR decrease of 0.46 dB are measured.

This review on breastfeeding and postpartum depression (PPD) begins by discussing the correlation between lactation and the maternal stress response. Another component discussed is the duration of breastfeeding and its importance in limiting PPD symptoms. The review then shifts to focus more on the psychological aspects of breastfeeding, notably on changes to the sleep-wake cycle and mother-infant interactions. The final part of the review emphasizes the danger that early breastfeeding cessation imposes on a mother's mental health, portraying how prenatal and early-onset postpartum depression may lead to early breastfeeding cessation. This composite collection of studies clarifies the importance of breastfeeding in reducing the incidence and severity of maternal postpartum depression.",breastfeeding; breastfeeding duration; mental health; postpartum depression; postpartum mental health; postpartum mothers.

The interplay between these two critical attributes on therapeutic glycoproteins, is however often hard to define. Here, we present a native top-down mass spectrometry (MS) approach to assess the glycosylation status of therapeutic cytokine and hormone assemblies and relate interfacial glycan occupancy to complex stability. We found that interfacial O-glycan stabilizes tumor necrosis factor-α trimer. On the contrary, interferon-β1a dimerization is independent of glycosylation. Moreover, we discovered a unique distribution of N-glycans on the follicle-stimulating hormone α subunit. We found that the interfacial N-glycan, at Asn52 of the α subunit, interacts extensively with the β subunit to regulate the dimer assembly. Overall, we have exemplified a method to link glycosylation with assembly status, for cytokines and hormones, critical for informing optimal stability and bioavailability.",Biopharmaceuticals; Glycan; Glycoprotein; Native Mass Spectrometry; Oligomerization.

The tetanus toxoid was mixed with polymeric blend and patches were prepared by using vacuum micromolding technique. Microneedle patches were evaluated for physical attributes such as uniformity of thickness, folding endurance, and swelling profile. Morphological features were assessed by optical and scanning electron microscopy. In vitro performance of fabricated patches was studied by using bicinchoninic acid assay (BCA). Insertion ability of microstructures was studied in vitro on model skin parafilm and in vivo in albino rat. In vivo immunogenic activity of the formulation was assessed by recording immunoglobulin G (IgG) levels, interferon gamma (IFN-γ) levels, and T-cell (CD4+ and CD8+) count following the application of dosage forms. Prepared patches, displaying sharp-tipped and smooth-surfaced microstructures, remained intact after 350 ± 36 foldings. Optimized microneedle patch formulation showed ~ 74% swelling and ~ 85.6% vaccine release within an hour. The microneedles successfully pierced parafilm. Histological examination of microneedle-treated rat skin confirmed disruption of epidermis without damaging the underneath vasculature. A significant increase in IgG levels (~ 21%), IFN-γ levels (~ 30%), CD4+ (~ 41.5%), and CD8+ (~ 48.5%) cell count was observed in tetanus vaccine-loaded microneedle patches treated albino rats with respect to control (untreated) group at 42nd day of immunization. In conclusion, tetanus toxoid-loaded microneedle patches can be considered as an efficient choice for transdermal delivery of vaccine without inducing pain commonly experienced with hypodermic needles.",Bicinchoninic acid assay; Carboxymethyl cellulose; Flow cytometry; Immunization; Immunoglobulin G; Interferon gamma; Microneedles; Polyvinyl pyrrolidone; Tetanus toxoid vaccine.
1367,Correlation-aware adversarial domain adaptation and generalization,"Rahman, Mohammad Mahfujur; Fookes, Clinton; Baktashmotlagh, Mahsa; Sridharan, Sridha","Domain adaptation (DA) and domain generalization (DG) have emerged as a solution to the domain shift problem where the distribution of the source and target data is different. The task of DG is more challenging than DA as the target data is totally unseen during the training phase in DG scenarios. The current state-of-the-art employs adversarial techniques, however, these are rarely considered for the DG problem. Furthermore, these approaches do not consider correlation alignment which has been proven highly beneficial for minimizing domain discrepancy. In this paper, we propose a correlation-aware adversarial DA and DG framework where the features of the source and target data are minimized using correlation alignment along with adversarial learning. Incorporating the correlation alignment module along with adversarial learning helps to achieve a more domain agnostic model due to the improved ability to reduce domain discrepancy with unlabeled target data more effectively. Experiments on benchmark datasets serve as evidence that our proposed method yields improved state-of-the-art performance. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

These take the form of small perturbations applied to the model's input which lead to incorrect predictions. Unfortunately, most literature focuses on visually imperceivable perturbations to be applied to digital images that often are, by design, impossible to be deployed to physical targets. We present Adversarial Scratches: a novel L-0 black-box attack, which takes the form of scratches in images, and which possesses much greater deployability than other state-of-the-art attacks. Adversarial Scratches leverage Bezier Curves to reduce the dimension of the search space and possibly constrain the attack to a specific location. We test Adversarial Scratches in several scenarios, including a publicly available API and images of traffic signs. Results show that our attack achieves higher fooling rate than other deployable state-of-the-art methods, while requiring significantly fewer queries and modifying very few pixels.

1370,"A Deep Framework Assembling Principled Modules for CS-MRI: Unrolling Perspective, Convergence Behaviors, and Practical Modeling","Liu, Risheng; Zhang, Yuxi; Cheng, Shichao; Luo, Zhongxuan; Fan, Xin","Compressed Sensing Magnetic Resonance Imaging (CS-MRI) significantly accelerates MR acquisition at a sampling rate much lower than the Nyquist criterion. A major challenge for CS-MRI lies in solving the severely ill-posed inverse problem to reconstruct aliasing-free MR images from the sparse k-space data. Conventional methods typically optimize an energy function, producing restoration of high quality, but their iterative numerical solvers unavoidably bring extremely large time consumption. Recent deep techniques provide fast restoration by either learning direct prediction to final reconstruction or plugging learned modules into the energy optimizer. Nevertheless, these data-driven predictors cannot guarantee the reconstruction following principled constraints underlying the domain knowledge so that the reliability of their reconstruction process is questionable. In this paper, we propose a deep framework assembling principled modules for CS-MRI that fuses learning strategy with the iterative solver of a conventional reconstruction energy. This framework embeds an optimal condition checking mechanism, fostering efficient and reliable reconstruction. We also apply the framework to three practical tasks, i.e., complex-valued data reconstruction, parallel imaging and reconstruction with Rician noise. Extensive experiments on both benchmark and manufacturer-testing images demonstrate that the proposed method reliably converges to the optimal solution more efficiently and accurately than the state-of-the-art in various scenarios.",Compressed sensing; MRI reconstruction; deep learning; optimization; parallel imaging; Rician noise
1371,"Autonomy, procedural and substantive: a discussion of the ethics of cognitive enhancement","Igor D Bandeira,Enzo Lenine,Igor D Bandeira,Enzo Lenine","As cognitive enhancement research advances, important ethical questions regarding individual autonomy and freedom are raised. Advocates of cognitive enhancement frequently adopt a procedural approach to autonomy, arguing that enhancers improve an individual's reasoning capabilities, which are quintessential to being an autonomous agent. On the other hand, critics adopt a more nuanced approach by considering matters of authenticity and self-identity, which go beyond the mere assessment of one's reasoning capacities. Both positions, nevertheless, require further philosophical scrutiny. In this paper, we investigate the ethics of cognitive enhancement through the lenses of political and philosophical arguments about autonomy and freedom. In so doing, we contend that a substantive, relational account of individual autonomy offers a more holistic understanding of the ethical concerns of cognitive enhancement.",Autonomy; Cognitive enhancement; Freedom; Neuroethics.
1372,Disruption of glucocorticoid receptors in the noradrenergic system leads to BDNF up-regulation and altered serotonergic transmission associated with a depressive-like phenotype in female GR(DBHCre) mice,"Piotr Chmielarz,Grzegorz Kreiner,Marta Kot,Agnieszka Zelek-Molik,Marta Kowalska,Monika Bagińska,Władysława Anna Daniel,Irena Nalepa,Piotr Chmielarz,Grzegorz Kreiner,Marta Kot,Agnieszka Zelek-Molik,Marta Kowalska,Monika Bagińska,Władysława Anna Daniel,Irena Nalepa","Recently, we have demonstrated that conditional inactivation of glucocorticoid receptors (GRs) in the noradrenergic system, may evoke depressive-like behavior in female but not male mutant mice (GR(DBHCre) mice). The aim of the current study was to dissect how selective ablation of glucocorticoid signaling in the noradrenergic system influences the previously reported depressive-like phenotype and whether it might be linked to neurotrophic alterations or secondary changes in the serotonergic system. We demonstrated that selective depletion of GRs enhances brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) expression in female but not male GR(DBHCre) mice on both the mRNA and protein levels. The possible impact of the mutation on brain noradrenergic and serotonergic systems was addressed by investigating the tissue neurotransmitter levels under basal conditions and after acute restraint stress. The findings indicated a stress-provoked differential response in tissue noradrenaline content in the GR(DBHCre) female but not male mutant mice. An analogous gender-specific effect was identified in the diminished content of 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid, the main metabolite of serotonin, in the prefrontal cortex, which suggests down-regulation of this monoamine system in female GR(DBHCre) mice. The lack of GR also resulted in an up-regulation of alpha2-adrenergic receptor (α2-AR) density in the female but not male mutants in the locus coeruleus. We have also confirmed the utility of the investigated model in pharmacological studies, which demonstrates that the depressive-like phenotype of GR(DBHCre) female mice can be reversed by antidepressant treatment with desipramine or fluoxetine, with the latter drug evoking more pronounced effects. Overall, our study validates the use of female GR(DBHCre) mice as an interesting and novel genetic tool for the investigation of the cross-connected mechanisms of depression that is not only based on behavioral phenotypes.",Antidepressant; Female; Gender; Glucocorticoid; Mouse; Noradrenergic.
1373,Joint Inference for Aspect-Level Sentiment Analysis by Deep Neural Networks and Linguistic Hints,"Wang, Yanyan; Chen, Qun; Ahmed, Murtadha; Li, Zhanhuai; Pan, Wei; Liu, Hailong","The state-of-the-art techniques for aspect-level sentiment analysis focused on feature modeling using a variety of deep neural networks (DNN). Unfortunately, their performance may still fall short of expectation in real scenarios due to the semantic complexity of natural languages. Motivated by the observation that many linguistic hints (e.g., sentiment words and shift words) are reliable polarity indicators, we propose a joint framework, SenHint, which can seamlessly integrate the output of deep neural networks and the implications of linguistic hints in a unified model based on Markov logic network (MLN). SenHint leverages the linguistic hints for multiple purposes: (1) to identify the easy instances, whose polarities can be automatically determined by the machine with high accuracy; (2) to capture the influence of sentiment words on aspect polarities; (2) to capture the implicit relations between aspect polarities. We present the required techniques for extracting linguistic hints, encoding their implications as well as the output of DNN into the unified model, and joint inference. Finally, we have empirically evaluated the performance of SenHint on both English and Chinese benchmark datasets. Our extensive experiments have shown that compared to the state-of-the-art DNN techniques, SenHint can effectively improve polarity detection accuracy by considerable margins.",Sentiment analysis; Linguistics; Neural networks; Task analysis; Markov processes; Cognition; Analytical models; Deep neural networks; linguistic hints; aspect-level sentiment analysis

Nevertheless, there is a huge number of art education businesses competing for a share of China's art education industry, which is of a very modest size. Given the evolution of the economy and innovative culture, it is of the utmost necessity to comprehend both brand equity and corporate success in the present day. This study explored the relationship between brand equity and company performance under the adjustment of innovation culture using Chinese art education businesses as the baseline study. The present study examined the relationship between the five components of brand equity that are primarily comprised of brand awareness, brand association, perceived quality, brand loyalty, brand relevance, and brand equity with the moderating impact of innovation culture. A total of 300 respondents, including art education firm managers, teachers, and other key employees, participated in the survey and WarpPLS 8.0 was used to evaluate the proposed model. Subsequently, the statistical findings revealed a significant positive relationship between the brand equity components (i.e., perceived quality and brand relevance) and a firm's performance, while a firm's innovation culture was discovered to moderate the said relationship. The implications of these findings are further discussed.",China; brand equity; innovation culture; firm performance
1375,Low-Dose CBCT Reconstruction Using Hessian Schatten Penalties,"Liu, Liang; Li, Xinxin; Xiang, Kai; Wang, Jing; Tan, Shan","Cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) has been widely used in radiation therapy. For accurate patient setup and treatment target localization, it is important to obtain high-quality reconstruction images. The total variation (TV) penalty has shown the state-of-the-art performance in suppressing noise and preserving edges for statistical iterative image reconstruction, but it sometimes leads to the so-called staircase effect. In this paper, we proposed to use a new family of penalties-the Hessian Schatten (HS) penalties-for the CBCT reconstruction. Consisting of the second-order derivatives, the HS penalties are able to reflect the smooth intensity transitions of the underlying image without introducing the staircase effect. We discussed and compared the behaviors of several convex HS penalties with orders 1, 2, and +infinity for CBCT reconstruction. We used the majorization-minimization approach with a primal-dual formulation for the corresponding optimization problem. Experiments on two digital phantoms and two physical phantoms demonstrated the proposed penalty family's outstanding performance over TV in suppressing the staircase effect, and the HS penalty with order 1 had the best performance among the HS penalties tested.",CBCT; image reconstruction; TV; staircase effect; Hessian Schatten penalty

Abstractive summarization generates a concise summary to capture the key ideas of the source text. This task underpins important applications like information retrieval, document comprehension, and event tracking. While much progress has been achieved, state-of-the-art summarization approaches often fail to generate high-quality summaries to reproduce factual details accurately. One of the key limitations of existing solutions is that they are primarily concerned about extracting facts from the source text but overlook other crucial factual information, such as the related time, locations, reasons, consequences, purposes, participants and involved parties. Furthermore, the current summarization frameworks are inadequate in modeling the complex semantic relations among facts and the corresponding factual information, leaving much room for improvement. This paper presents FFSum, a novel summarization framework for exploiting multi-grained factual information to improve text summarization. To this end, FFSum constructs an individual fine-grained factual graph with multiple relations among facts and the corresponding factual information. It employs a fact-driven graph attention network to integrate multi-granular factual representations at the encoding stage. It then uses a hybrid pointer network to retrieve factual pieces from the graph for the summary generation. We evaluate the FFSum by applying it to two real-world datasets. Experimental results show that the FFSum consistently outperforms a state-of-the-art approach across evaluation datasets.",Fact consistency; graph neural network; language model; pointer network; text summarization

S.; Rivas, T.; Carrera, F.; Garcia, L.","Prehistoric rock art sites are endangered despite conservation efforts. The lack of scientific documentation regarding weathering agents affecting rock art and the absence of specific diagnostic protocols hinder the development of conservation strategies. The aim of this research was to investigate active deterioration processes in a granite petroglyph site located in Mougas (Galicia, NW Spain) by characterizing the granite, conducting a geotechnical study of the outcrop and describing and analysing the main weathering processes. Two main deterioration factors were identified. First, water favours block disjunction at the massif scale and causes pitting and surface erosion at the millimetre scale that affects the readability of the engravings. Second, high temperatures associated with wildfires cause mineral transformations that increase the susceptibility of the rock to weathering. Identifying deterioration factors is a first step in developing appropriate preventive conservation measures, which should aim to reduce rock contact time with water (technically affordable in the short term) and to reduce the probability of wildfire occurrence (technically more complex and possibly with longer-term results).

Therefore, when dealing with HDR content, substantial work by very skilled technicians has to be carried out at every step of the movie production chain.

These methods are automatic and real-time, and they have been both fine-tuned and validated by cinema professionals, with psychophysical tests demonstrating that the proposed algorithms outperform both the academic and industrial state-of-the-art. We believe these methods bring the field closer to having fully automated solutions for important challenges for the cinema industry that are currently solved manually or sub-optimally.

Most research, however, has concentrated on aboveground mammals, with much less published on subterranean fauna. Here, we explored variation in anatomy and sensitivity of the semicircular canals among 91 mammal species, including both subterranean and non-subterranean representatives. Quantitative phylogenetically informed analyses showed significant widening of the canals relative to radius of curvature in subterranean species. A relative canal width above 0.166 indicates with 95% certainty that a species is subterranean. Fluid-structure interaction modelling predicted that canal widening leads to a substantial increase in canal sensitivity; a reasonably good estimation of the absolute sensitivity is possible based on the absolute internal canal width alone. In addition, phylogenetic comparative modelling and functional landscape exploration revealed repeated independent evolution of increased relative canal width and anterior canal sensitivity associated with the transition to a subterranean lifestyle, providing evidence of parallel adaptation. Our results suggest that living in dark, subterranean tunnels requires good balance and/or navigation skills which may be facilitated by more sensitive semicircular canals.",Fluid–structure interaction model; Functional landscape; Internal canal width; Semicircular canal; Subarcuate fossa.

This has been possible because the decorated chambers were intact at the moment of the discovery and, soon after, protocols were put in place to protect these invaluable records. These types of caves are a minority. In the Cantabrian region, most of the discoveries took place at the beginning of the 20th century and, in some cases, a few years after the first studies were published, the caves were greatly modified to prepare them for tourist visits in the 1950s. However, the study of historical documents can provide information regarding the context and the original spatial distribution of the caves. Using the available data from different historical sources such as pictures, descriptions, sketches, plans, etc. available in publications and unpublished materials, we can reconstruct, to a limited extent, the appearance of a cave in the moment of its discovery. The information gathered by the different researchers in the last hundred years to advance in the knowledge of La Pasiega cave in Puente Viesgo (Cantabria) is used to prove the validity of this approach. The results, combining information from the available sources and careful observation in the cave, are positive, allowing us to advance significantly in the understanding of the cave's spatial characteristics.

Benchmark with three simulation codes,"Frosio, Thomas; Bertreix, Philippe; Menaa, Nabil; Thomas, Samuel; Eberhardt, Holger; Endres, Janis","Handling of radioactive material by operators can lead to contamination at the surface of the skin in case of an accident. The quantification of the dose received by the skin due to a contamination scenario is performed by means of dedicated dose coefficients as it is the case for other radiation protection dose quantities described in the literature. However, most available coefficients do not match realistic scenarios according to state-of-the-art of science and technology. Therefore, this work deals with dedicated dose conversion factors for skin contamination. Since there is an increasing demand on dose coefficients in general, these specific coefficients can be used for various calculations in radiation protection. In this work a method to evaluate such coefficients for the skin contamination dose related to photons, electrons, positrons, alpha and neutron particles is proposed. The coefficients are generated using Monte-Carlo simulations with three well established calculation codes (FLUKA, MCNP, and GEANT4). The results of the various codes are compared against each other for benchmarking purposes. The new dose coefficients allow the computation of the skin received dose, in the case of skin contamination scenario of an individual, taking into account the decay radiation of the radionuclides of interest. To benchmark the quantity derived here, comparisons of radionuclide contamination doses to the skin using the VARSKIN code available in the literature are performed with the results of this work.",radiation protection; skin contamination dose; dose coefficients; Monte-Carlo simulations; MCNP; FLUKA; GEANT4

The main parameters influencing the extraction efficiency of MSPE were investigated and optimized. By coupling MHNTs@PDA@Cu2+-based MSPE with HPLC-UV, a simple, fast and sensitive method for the determination of trace Sudan dyes in food samples were developed. Good linearity (R2 ≥ 0.9937) and low limits of detection (0.06-0.10 μg L-1) were obtained. The method was successfully applied to determine Sudan dyes in juice, soy sauce and red wine, and the recoveries for the spiked samples ranged from 78.1% to 112.4% with RSD less than 9.0%.",Food samples; HPLC-UV; Immobilized metal affinity magnetic nanoparticles; Magnetic solid-phase extraction; Sudan dyes.

Invisible dimensional changes in many works of art occur following environmental fluctuations as materials respond to the changes in humidity and temperature. The constant influence of dimensional changes usually remains invisible until displacement generates visible deterioration and irreversible damage. This paper exploits fully non contact coherent interferometry in a sequential masking procedure for visualising and studying surface deformation which is the direct effect of dimensional alterations induced by humidity changes. Surface deformation during dimensional displacements of constituent materials may occur on any artwork within an unstable environment. In this context, the presented research study explores the diagnostic potential of fully non contact sensors for the direct structural assessment of environmental effects as they occur in real time on works of art. The method is employed to characterise material responses, complementing and improving understanding of material behaviour in unstable environments.",Optical Metrology; Optical Holography; Holographic Interferometry Non Destructive Testing; Speckle Interferometry; Artwork conservation; Dimensional effects; Environment; Sensors

In this study, we demonstrate that learning a convolutional neural network (CNN) for depth estimation with an auxiliary optical flow network and the epipolar geometry constraint can greatly benefit the depth estimation task and in turn yield large improvements in both accuracy and speed. Our architecture is composed of two tightly-coupled encoder-decoder networks, i.e., an optical flow net and a depth net, the core part being a list of exchange blocks between the two nets and an epipolar feature layer in the optical flow net to improve predictions of both depth and optical flow. Our architecture allows to input arbitrary number of multiview images with a linearly growing time cost for optical flow and depth estimation. Experimental result on five public datasets demonstrates that our method, named DENAO, runs at 38.46fps on a single Nvidia TITAN Xp GPU which is 5.15X similar to 142X faster than the state-of-the-art depth estimation methods Meanwhile, our DENAO can concurrently output predictions of both depth and optical flow, and performs on par with or outperforms the state-of-the-art depth estimation methods and optical flow methods.",Convolutional neural network; depth estimation; optical flow
1392,Network Pharmacology Was Used to Predict the Active Components and Prospective Targets of Paeoniae Radix Alba for Treatment in Endometriosis,"Yuting Sun,Junhong Cai,Shun Ding,Shan Bao,Yuting Sun,Junhong Cai,Shun Ding,Shan Bao","Endometriosis is one of the most common benign gynecologic diseases. Paeoniae Radix Alba (PRA) has been utilized to treat endometriosis. We wished to identify potential targets for PRA in the treatment of endometriosis, as well as to provide a groundwork for future studies into its pharmacological mechanism of action. Network pharmacology was employed to conduct investigations on PRA. Target proteins were chosen from the components of PRA for endometriosis treatment. A protein-protein interaction (PPI) was established using overlapping genes. Analyses of enrichment of function and signaling pathways were undertaken using the Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes databases to select ""hub genes."" Finally, the feasibility of analysis based on network pharmacology was determined using real-time reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and western blotting. We demonstrated that PRA has 25 bioactive components and 167 putative targets that are therapeutically important. The anti-inflammatory and immune-boosting actions of tumor necrosis factor, albumin, signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)3, mitogen-activated protein kinase, Jun, interleukin (IL)-1B, prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2, matrix metalloproteinase-9, vascular endothelial growth factor A, and IL-6 were identified as prospective targets. Seven major compounds in PRA and related to the STAT3 pathway could bind spontaneously to it. RT-qPCR and western blotting showed that expression of STAT3 and phospho-STAT3 was reduced significantly after PRA intervention. Hence, analyses of the active components of traditional Chinese medicine formulations through network pharmacology may open up new ideas for the treatment of diseases.",Endometriosis; Network pharmacology; Paeoniae Radix Alba; STAT3.
1393,Post-processing approaches for improving people detection performance,"Garcia-Martin, Alvaro; Martinez, Jose M.","People detection in video surveillance environments is a task that has been generating great interest. There are many approaches trying to solve the problem either in controlled scenarios or in very specific surveillance applications. We address one of the main problems of people detection, in video sequences: every people detector from the state of the art must maintain a balance between the number of false detections and the number of missing pedestrians. This compromise limits the global detection results. In order to reduce or relax this limitation and improve the detection results, we evaluate two different post-processing subtasks. Firstly, we propose the use of people-background segmentation as a filtering stage in people detection. Then, we evaluate the combination of different detection approaches in order to add robustness to the detection and therefore improve the detection results. And, finally, we evaluate the successive application of both post-processing approaches. Experiments have been performed on two extensive datasets and using different people detectors from the state of the art: the results show the benefits achieved using the proposed post-processing techniques.

1395,Making (Non)Sense of Urban Water Flows: Qualities and Processes for Transformative and Transgressive Learning Moments,"James, Anna","Urban sustainability and justice depend upon the flow of water across complex urban space. Yet, the characteristics of urban space produce a fragmented sense of our water resources. Cape Town, South Africa, the context of this research, is one such city whose water challenges have been exacerbated by climate change-induced drought, to the extent that the city nearly shut off the water running to residents' taps. This context presents a particular challenge for the focus of this special issue, transformative and transgressive learning, an emerging arena of thought and practice concerned with learning processes that might foster more sustainable socio-ecological relations. The empirical material for this research draws from 12 arts-based inquiry workshops run with youth in an environmental organisation over four months, exploring a local water crisis. The data were generated through an engaged arts-based research process. The paper traces how transformative and transgressive learning in the context of urban water crisis might be characterised as making (non)sense by bringing the empirical material into dialogue with five entry points of transformative and transgressive learning literature rooted in Freirean educational praxis. This paper crafts and engages the concept of making (non)sense, a way of thinking about qualities and processes of learning praxis that responds to the wicked sustainability challenges we face today, particularly in terms of a Global South perspective. I argue such a praxis needs qualities and processes that disrupt and trouble the norm in the context of the socio-ecological challenge of urban water.",transformative and transgressive learning; urban water; arts-based participatory inquiry; making (non)sense

This paper shows that Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) can substantially improve the performance of the Ambrosia pollen emission in numerical pollen dispersion models such as COSMO-ART. Based on simultaneous measurement of Ambrosia pollen concentrations and meteorological variables in the source area, ANNs were trained to predict the diurnal profile of pollen emission. Six different combinations of explanatory meteorological variables were trained with five different ANN configurations resulting in 30 candidate emission models. The best network configuration for each combination of explanatory variables were used as emission parameterization in the numerical pollen dispersion model COSMO-ART. In addition, two benchmarks were implemented: an emission parameterization based on sigmoid functions and an artificial neural network using only time as an explanatory variable. The Ambrosia pollen seasons of 2015 and 2016 were simulated using the two benchmarks and the six emission parameterizations. The modelled diurnal profile of emission fluxes at 15 different sites from Serbia, Hungary and France with strong local pollen sources were compared with observed concentrations. Artificial Neural Networks based emission parameterization substantially improved the performance of the Ambrosia pollen emission in COSMO-ART compared to the emission based on the sigmoid functions in all these three countries. However, a time-related explanatory variable must be used. This suggests that the ANN-based emission parameterizations can be used at distant locations as well. On the other hand, the use of meteorological related parameters did not increase the performance compared with the time-only benchmark.",Artificial neural networks; Numerical pollen dispersion model COSMO-ART; Ambrosia pollen emission parameterization; Supervised learning
1397,VEDesc: vertex-edge constraint on local learned descriptors,"Yin, Jianhua; Zhu, Longzhen; Bai, Yang; He, Zhenyu","To improve the performance of local learned descriptors, many researchers pay primary attention to the triplet loss network. As expected, it is useful to achieve state-of-the-art performance on various datasets. However, these local learned descriptors suffer from the inconsistency problem without considering the relationship between two descriptors in a patch. Consequently, the problem causes the irregular spatial distribution of local learned descriptors. In this paper, we propose a neat method to overcome the above inconsistency problem. The core idea is to design a triplet loss function of vertex-edge constraint (VEC), which takes the correlation between two descriptors of a patch into account. Furthermore, to minimize the non-matching descriptors' influence, we propose an exponential algorithm to reduce the difference between the long and short sides. The competitive performance against state-of-the-art methods on various datasets demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed method.",Local learned descriptors; Inconsistency issue; The triplet loss function

Recently, the neural network has been employed in the feature point matching to improve matching performance. Among the state-of-the-art feature point matching methods, the SuperGlue is one of the top methods and ranked the first in the CVPR 2020 workshop on image matching. However, this method utilizes graph neural network (GNN), resulting in large computational complexity, which makes it unsuitable for resource-constrained devices, such as robots and mobile phones. In this work, we propose a lightweight feature point matching method based on the SuperGlue (named as AdaSG). Compared to the SuperGlue, the AdaSG adaptively adjusts its operating architecture according to the similarity of input image pair to reduce the computational complexity while achieving high matching performance. The proposed method has been evaluated through the commonly used datasets, including indoor and outdoor environments. Compared with several state-of-the-art feature point matching methods, the proposed method achieves significantly less runtime (up to 43x for indoor and up to 6x for outdoor) with similar or better matching performance. It is suitable for feature point matching in resource constrained devices.",feature point matching; GNN; VSLAM
1400,TVVS: A top-view visualization system from broadcasting soccer video,"Sanyal, Samriddha","A holy grail for sports analytics is the top-view visualization of the game. The top-view visualization provides the actual between-player distances as opposed to the between-player distances calculated from the side and/or oblique view of a match. Related work in this area relies on multiple camera installations in the stadium or directly derive the registration map between a broadcasting video and the top-view model. Aberrating the state-of-the-art, a factor theory based approach is presented to derive the top-view visualization of the game from the broadcasting sports video. It is theoretically proved that the proposed factor theory based approach is more efficient than the state-of-the-art approach for the top-view visualization. In addition, as per the proposed approach, a model is presented for the top-view visualization by transforming the broadcasting video into a single and static camera visualization. In order to generate the single-camera visualization, the view of the entire ground is needed which is expressed as a solution to a convex optimization function, devised to explore putative matrix completions. To give pristine empirical evidence, the benchmark dataset is used and a soccer dataset has been introduced towards the end. The proposed top-view approach brings atleast 7% and 10% gains over the state-of-the-art on the benchmark and the proposed dataset respectively.",Factor theory; Matrix completion; Top-view visualization; Video representation

Fishes of the Cichlidae family can adapt spectacular trophic radiations and provide good potential examples of vertebrate adaptive radiations. Here, we firstly assembled the complete mitochondrial genome (mitogenome) of Pundamilia nyererei. The mitgenome was 16 761 bp in length, including 13 protein-coding genes, 22 transfer RNA genes, 2 ribosomal RNA genes and 1 putative control region. Most of these protein-coding genes started with a traditional ATG codon except for COX1, which initiated with an infrequent start codon GTG instead, and terminated with the mitochondrial stop codon (TAA/AGG/AGA) or a single T base. The mitogenome structural organization is identical to other Cichlid fish. The overall GC content is 45.25%, which is lower than the AT content. According to these new determined mitogenome sequences and 10 other species under the same family or order, we have constructed the species phylogenetic tree to verify the accuracy of newly assembled mitogenome sequences. We accept that by taking the advantage of full mitogenome, we can address taxonomic issue and study the related evolutionary events. Our current data are going to provide important resources for the research of Cichlid fishes mitochondrial evolution and energy metabolism.",Cichlid; Pundamilia nyererei; mitogenome.

However, few studies focused on the effects of fluoride on osteocytes, making up over 95% of all bone cells. This study aimed to investigate the effect of fluoride on osteocytes in vitro, as well as explore the underlying mechanisms. CCK-8, LDH assay, fluorescent probes, flow cytometry, and western blotting were performed to examine cell viability, apoptosis, mitochondria changes, reactive oxygen species (ROS) and mitochondrial ROS (mtROS), and protein expressions. Results showed that sodium fluoride (NaF) exposure (4, 8 mmol/L) for 24 h inhibited the cell viability of osteocytes MLO-Y4 and promoted G0/G1 phase arrest and increased cell apoptosis. NaF treatment remarkably caused mitochondria damage, loss of MMP, ATP decrease, Cyto c release, and Bax/Bcl-2 ratio increase and elevated the activity of caspase-9 and caspase-3. Furthermore, NaF significantly upregulated the expressions of LC-3II, PINK1, and Parkin and increased autophagy flux and the accumulation of acidic vacuoles, while the p62 level was downregulated. In addition, NaF exposure triggered the production of intracellular ROS and mtROS and increased malondialdehyde (MDA); but superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity and glutathione (GSH) content were decreased. The scavenger N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) significantly reversed NaF-induced apoptosis and mitophagy, suggesting that ROS is responsible for the mitochondrial-mediated apoptosis and mitophagy induced by NaF exposure. These findings provide in vitro evidence that apoptosis and mitophagy are cellular mechanisms for the toxic effect of fluoride on osteocytes, thereby suggesting the potential role of osteocytes in skeletal and dental fluorosis.",Apoptosis; Fluoride; Mitochondria; Mitophagy; Osteocytes; ROS.

1405,Towards carbon neutrality: what has been done and what needs to be done for carbon emission reduction?,"Liming Yao,Shiqi Tan,Zhongwen Xu,Liming Yao,Shiqi Tan,Zhongwen Xu","Carbon emissions embodied in anthropogenic activities represent the major cause of global warming. Countries, regions, and cities have implemented comprehensive, multi-level and multi-scale measures to reduce emissions and move towards carbon neutrality. The demand for carbon emission reduction (CER) is made more challenging by different geographical locations, country-owned natural resources, and economic development stages. The main objectives of this paper are to conduct a bibliometric analysis to map the frontiers and directions of CER and to explore the paths and development models of CER from the perspective of spatio-temporal, multi-scale, multi-sectoral, and multi-responsible subjects. This study reveals that carbon emission evaluation and prediction, correlation and causal relationship analysis, and CER-related policy simulation and optimization are the most critical hotspots. Additionally, we point out the shortcomings of and future developments for the three study dimensions above. The bibliometric analysis also highlights the fact that a cooperative global value chain as well as amendable policies and mechanisms for CER will help with climate change mitigation and adaptation through the use of advanced carbon capture and storage technologies. We review the technical measures for and policy responses to CER adopted by different countries and industries at the theoretical and practical levels and provide new recommendations.

Ten patients underwent in-bag morcellation of myomas with a tissue isolation bag (MorSafe) between November 2014 and January 2015. The MorSafe tissue isolation bag is a retort-shaped bag made of medical-grade flexible plastic material with the wider opening of 134 mm in diameter and the tail end measuring 4 mm in diameter, allowing easy accomodation of specimens up to 12 cm in diameter. This technique involves placing the myomas into the isolation bag within the abdomen, exteriorizing the tail end of the bag, insufflating the bag within the peritoneal cavity, and morcellating the myomas under vision. Demographic and perioperative characteristics were studied. The mean operative time was 117 minutes (range, 75-195 minutes), the mean time for specimen introduction into the bag was 12.5 minutes (range, 7-22 minutes), and the mean time for morcellation and bag removal was 24.8 minutes (range, 10-50 minutes). There were no complications related to the in-bag morcellation technique, and there was no visual evidence of damage to the isolation bag. In-bag morcellation using this new bag is a feasible technique for morcellating uterine myomas in a contained manner and may provide an option to minimize the risks of open power morcellation while preserving the benefits of minimally invasive surgery.",Bag; Contained morcellation; Laparoscopic myomectomy.

We reported weighted percentages of characteristics and used logistic regression with predicted marginal means to examine differences between groups (p < 0.05). PR-born Hispanics/Latinos were more likely to be prescribed antiretroviral therapy (ART) (94%) and retained in care (94%) than mainland-US-born (79% and 77%, respectively) and non-US-born (91% and 87%, respectively) Hispanics/Latinos.

In the considered scenario in which two secondary sources may transmit simultaneously, intelligent apportioning the interference temperature limit (ITL) is vital. We consider cases when this ITL apportioning is based on statistical properties of the channels, or on full (or partial) knowledge of the channel gains. For these cases, proper network management (NM) strategies are evolved to maximize sum throughput or sum ergodic rate of the secondary networks. Each NM strategy determines whether both secondary sources should transmit concurrently or not, and also determines their transmit powers. We demonstrate that a channel aware NM strategy is superior to an optimal fixed NM strategy. With secondary sources employing non-opportunistic user selection, in case of FRT (ART), we demonstrate that there exists a critical target-rate (ITL) below which it is advantageous to operate both secondary networks concurrently. We present closed form expressions of critical parameters that influence sum throughput and sum ergodic rate. Computer simulations are presented to corroborate the derived expressions.",Co-existing networks; underlay; downlink; sum throughput; sum ergodic rate; network management

A cross-sectional study was conducted. Forty patients with a primary, unilateral ACL injury who had finished the preoperative rehabilitation and scheduled for an ACLR were included. KF was evaluated using the International Knee Documentation Committee score. QS was measured by maximal voluntary isometric contractions. RTD was divided into the early (RTD0-50) and the late (RTD100-200) phases. Quadriceps VA was measured using the superimposed burst technique. Our results showed that patients with poor preoperative KF had more deficits in RTD0-50 (P = 0.025), higher BMI(P = 0.043), and more meniscus injuries (MI) (P = 0.001) than those with good KF. Patients with asymmetrical QS showed lower BMI (P = 0.020) and shorter time from injury (TFI) (P = 0.027) than those with symmetrical QS. Additionally, a higher pre-injury Tegner score combined with greater RTD100-200 contributed to greater QS on the injured limb (R2 = 0.357, P = 0.001). To conclude, BMI, TFI, concomitant MI, pre-injury physical activity level, and quadriceps RTD are related to QS and KF before ACLR.",ACL; knee extensors; preoperative physiotherapy.

According to art study criteria, the Shigir Idol can be referred to monumental sculpture. Its Mesolithic age allows to put it at the beginning of the pre-literate period monumental sculpture range in Eurasian history - sculptures of Yamnaya, Chemurchek and Okunevo cultures, Scythian deer stones and Middle Age stone idols. The Big Shigir Idol's anthropomorphic iconographic characteristics, synthesis with its decorative features demonstrate a fully formed representational tradition. In spite of the idea of Ural Mesolithic Age origin, the author believes that the Shigir Idol's representational tradition could have been formed in the local Taiga environment unlike the art and craft tradition. The discussion concerning the problem of the long existence of this tradition follows the part about the spreading of anthropomorphic representations in cultures of the Neolithic, Bronze and Iron Ages in Northern Europe, the part about the representational traditions trends. As for the problem of Mesolithic representational tradition preservation in wooden sculpture up to modern and contemporary times in modern indigenous peoples in Western Siberia, it is not possible to solve it with archaeological sources yet.

The current state-of-the-art of gQAC provides suggestions that are formed by adding subgraph increments to arbitrary places of an existing (partial) user query. However, according to the research results on human-computer interaction (HCI), humans can only interact with a small number of recent software artifacts in hand. Hence, many of such suggestions could be irrelevant. In this paper, we present the GFocus framework that exploits a novel notion of user focus of graph query formulation (or simply focus). Intuitively, the focus is the subgraph that a user is working on. We formulate locality principles inspired by the HCI research to automatically identify and maintain the focus. We propose novel monotone submodular ranking functions for generating popular and comprehensive query suggestions only at the focus. In particular, the query suggestions of GFocus have high result counts (when they are used as queries) and maximally cover the possible suggestions at the focus. We propose efficient algorithms and an index for ranking the suggestions. Our results show that GFocus saves 12-32 percent more mouse clicks and is 35x more efficient than the state-of-the-art competitor.",Visualization; Indexes; Human computer interaction; Visual databases; Usability; Computer science; Subgraph query; query autocompletion; database usability

H.; Kong, Lingxue","Texture classification is one of the most important tasks in computer vision field and it has been extensively investigated in the last several decades. Previous texture classification methods mainly used the template matching based methods such as Support Vector Machine and k-Nearest-Neighbour for classification. Given enough training images the state-of-the-art texture classification methods could achieve very high classification accuracies on some benchmark databases. However, when the number of training images is limited, which usually happens in real-world applications because of the high cost of obtaining labelled data, the classification accuracies of those state-of-the-art methods would deteriorate due to the overfitting effect. In this paper we aim to develop a novel framework that could correctly classify textural images with only a small number of training images. By taking into account the repetition and sparsity property of textures we propose a sparse representation based multi-manifold analysis framework for texture classification from few training images. A set of new training samples are generated from each training image by a scale and spatial pyramid, and then the training samples belonging to each class are modelled by a manifold based on sparse representation. We learn a dictionary of sparse representation and a projection matrix for each class and classify the test images based on the projected reconstruction errors. The framework provides a more compact model than the template matching based texture classification methods, and mitigates the overfitting effect. Experimental results show that the proposed method could achieve reasonably high generalization capability even with as few as 3 training images, and significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art texture classification approaches on three benchmark datasets.

1413,Universal and adapted vocabularies for Generic Visual Categorization,"Perronnin, Florent","Generic Visual Categorization (GVC) is the pattern classification problem that consists in assigning labels to an image based on its semantic content. This is a challenging task as one has to deal with inherent object/scene variations, as well as changes in viewpoint, lighting, and occlusion. Several state-of-the-art GVC systems use a vocabulary of visual terms to characterize images with a histogram of visual word counts. We propose a novel practical approach to GVC based on a universal vocabulary, which describes the content of all the considered classes of images, and class vocabularies obtained through the adaptation of the universal vocabulary using class-specific data. The main novelty is that an image is characterized by a set of histograms-one per class-where each histogram describes whether the image content is best modeled by the universal vocabulary or the corresponding class vocabulary. This framework is applied to two types of local image features: low-level descriptors such as the popular SIFT and high-level histograms of word co-occurrences in a spatial neighborhood. It is shown experimentally on two challenging data sets (an in-house database of 19 categories and the PASCAL VOC 2006 data set) that the proposed approach exhibits state-of-the-art performance at a modest computational cost.",image categorization; bag-of-words; Gaussian mixture model; expectation-maximization; Bayesian adaptation
1414,Rate control versus rhythm control in atrial fibrillation: lessons learned from clinical trials of atrial fibrillation,"Albert L Waldo,Albert L Waldo","Ample evidence supports the statement that in patients with atrial fibrillation in whom treatment is warranted, either rhythm control or rate control are acceptable primary therapeutic options. If a rhythm control strategy is chosen, it is important to consider that recurrence of atrial fibrillation is not treatment failure per se. Occasional recurrence, with cardioversion if necessary, may be quite acceptable. The latter will depend on the frequency, duration and symptoms associated with recurrence, and may require a change in the rhythm control therapy, e.g., change the antiarrhythmic drug, or initiate or redo atrial fibrillation ablation. And a rhythm control strategy should include careful attention to and treatment of comorbidities (hypertension, heart failure, diabetes, etc.). If a rate control strategy is chosen, treatment with a beta blocker or nondihydropyridine calcium channel blocker is almost always required to achieve adequate rate control. Digoxin is often useful to obtain satisfactory rate control in combination with a beta blocker or nondihydropyridine calcium channel blocker. Digoxin may be useful as primary therapy in the presence of hypotension or heart failure. Satisfactory ventricular rate control is usually a resting rate less than 110 beats per minute, although resting rates below 90 beats per minute are probably wiser. Finally, when pursuing a rhythm control strategy, because recurrence of atrial fibrillation is common, rate control therapy should be a part of the treatment regimen.",Atrial fibrillation; Rate control; Rhythm control.

We give design considerations for per-channel digitization and beamforming, and present the design and measurements of a continuous time delta-sigma modulator (CTDSM) for cardiac ultrasound applications. By integrating a mixer into the modulator frontend, the phase and frequency of the input signal can be shifted, thereby enabling both improved conversion efficiency and narrowband beamforming. To minimize the power consumption, we propose an optimization methodology using a simulated annealing framework combined with a C++ simulator solving linear electrical networks. The 3rd order single-bit feedback type modulator, implemented in a 65 nm CMOS process, achieves an SNR/SNDR of 67.8/67.4 dB across 1 MHz bandwidth consuming 131 mu W of power. The achieved figure of merit of 34.2 fJ/step is comparable with state-of-the-art feedforward type multi-bit designs. We further demonstrate the influence to the dynamic range when performing dynamic receive beamforming on recorded delta-sigma modulated bit-stream sequences.",Analog to digital conversion; continuous time delta-sigma modulator; delta-sigma beamforming; phase-shift beamformer; single-sideband beamformer; ultrasound

The cDNA sequence of grouper IRF10 contains an open reading frame of 1197 bp, flanked by 99 bp 5'-untranslated region and 480 bp 3'- untranslated region. Multiple alignments showed that the grouper IRF10 has a highly conserved DNA binding domain in the N terminus with characteristic motif containing five tryptophan residues. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis revealed that the expression of IRF10 was responsive to both poly(I:C) stimulation and Vibrio parahemolyticus infection, with a higher increase to poly(I:C), indicating an important role of IRF10 in host immune response during infection. A phyletic distribution of IRF members was also examined in vertebrates, and IRF10 was found in most lineages of vertebrates, not in modern primates and rodents. It is suggested that the first divergence of IRF members might have occurred before the evolutionary split of vertebrate and cephalochordates, producing ancestors of IRF (1/2/11) and IRF (4/8/9/10)[(3/7) (5/6)], and that the second and/or third divergence of IRF members occurred following the split, thus leading to the subsets of the IRF family in vertebrates.",Epinephelus coioides; Evolution; IRF10; Orange spotted grouper; Vertebrate.
1418,Balancing Assisted Reproductive Technology Dataset for Improving the Efficiency of Incremental Classifiers and Feature Selection Techniques,"Suruliandi, A.; Ranjini, K.; Raja, S. P.","Assisted Reproductive Technology (ART) is a set of medical procedures primarily used to address infertility. Success Rate of ART is very low because it is affected by large number of variables. Machine Learning Techniques are now applied to predict ART outcome and to find strategies to improve success rate. For this, determining the best performing classifier for ART is very important. Previously, some classifiers are applied to ART with static data. But, in reality, the datasets are dynamic in nature and require dynamic setup which can be achieved with the help of Incremental Classifiers. Due to low success rate, the ART dataset contains less number of records for positive results that make the dataset imbalanced. This research work first finds the best evaluation metric for classification on imbalanced dataset and then balances the dataset using three different balancing techniques such as undersampling, oversampling and Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) and applies five different Incremental Classifiers, namely Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Stochastic Primal Estimated subGrAdient SOlver for Support vector machine (SPegasos), Naive Bayes Updatable, Instance Based (IBk), Averaged One Dependence Estimators (AIDE) Updatable and finds the best balancing technique and suitable classifier for ART outcome prediction. The result shows that for an imbalanced dataset Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) Area may be taken as a metric instead of the accuracy. It is found that SMOTE is best method for balancing the ART dataset and IB1 classifier performs well for the balanced data with the high prediction rate of 92.3 for ROC. Finally, various Feature Selection methods are applied to the top three best performing classifiers and suitable feature selection method for each classifier is identified.",Assisted reproductive technology (ART); imbalanced dataset; ROC; incremental classifiers; data balancing; feature selection

The force-sensing transistor consists of 1D piezoelectric zinc oxide (ZnO) nanorods (NRs) as the gate control and multilayer tungsten diselenide (WSe2) as the transistor channel. The applied mechanical force on piezoelectric NRs can induce a drain-source current change (ΔIds) on the WSe2 channel. The different doping types of the WSe2 channel have been found to lead to different directions of ΔIds. The pressure from the calibration weight of 5 g has been observed to result in an ∼30% Ids change for ZnO NRs on the p-type doped WSe2 device and an ∼-10% Ids change for the device with an n-type doped WSe2. The outcome of this work would be useful for applications in future human-machine interfaces and smart biomedical tools.,2D materials; ZnO nanorods; force sensors; low dimensional materials; piezo-gated field-effect transistors; piezoelectric effect.
1420,A Local Perturbation Generation Method for GAN-Generated Face Anti-Forensics,"Zhang, Haitao; Chen, Beijing; Wang, Jinwei; Zhao, Guoying","Although the current generative adversarial networks (GAN)-generated face forensic detectors based on deep neural networks (DNNs) have achieved considerable performance, they are vulnerable to adversarial attacks. In this paper, an effective local perturbation generation method is proposed to expose the vulnerability of state-of-the-art forensic detectors. The main idea is to mine the fake faces' areas of common concern in multiple-detectors' decision-making, then generate local anti-forensic perturbations by GANs in these areas to enhance the visual quality and transferability of anti-forensic faces. Meanwhile, in order to improve the anti-forensic effect, a double- mask (soft mask and hard mask) strategy and a three-part loss (the GAN training loss, the adversarial loss consisting of ensemble classification loss and ensemble feature loss, and the regularization loss) are designed for the training of the generator. Experiments conducted on fake faces generated by StyleGAN demonstrate the proposed method's advantage over the state-of-the-art methods in terms of anti-forensic success rate, imperceptibility, and transferability.

1421,The roles of social stress and decision-making in non-suicidal self-injury,"Heather T Schatten,Margaret S Andover,Michael F Armey,Heather T Schatten,Margaret S Andover,Michael F Armey","Research suggests that individuals with a history of non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) do not have difficulty generating alternatives to social problems but choose more negative solutions, suggesting a deficit in decision-making. However, studies report no significant differences in risky decision-making on a performance-based task among individuals with and without NSSI histories. A limitation of these studies is that decision-making was only assessed at baseline. As individuals with a history of NSSI typically self-injure when experiencing negative emotions, decision-making ability may become impaired specifically in the presence of these emotions. The aim of the current study was to investigate decision-making ability among individuals with and without NSSI histories both at baseline and following a distressing social exclusion task. We compared individuals with (n=48) and without (n=72) NSSI histories on the Iowa Gambling Task, a behavioral measure of risky decision-making, before and after exclusion or inclusion on the Cyberball task. Results indicated no significant group differences in performance regardless of condition. When participants were grouped by racial/ethnic minority status, results indicated that non-Hispanic White individuals with a history of NSSI exhibited deterioration in risky decision-making ability following social exclusion.

Therefore, a self-supervised learning technique that can improve the recognition rate using unlabeled data will be useful for remote sensing. This letter presents contrastive self-supervised learning with smoothed representation for remote sensing based on the SimCLR framework. In self-supervised learning for remote sensing, the well-known characteristic that images within a short distance might be semantically similar is usually used. Our algorithm is based on this knowledge, and it simultaneously utilizes several neighboring images as a positive pair of the anchor image, unlike existing methods such as Tile2Vec. Furthermore, MoCo and SimCLR, which are among the state-of-the-art self-supervised learning approaches, only use two augmented views of the single-input image, but our proposed approach uses multiple-input images and averages their representations (e.g., smoothed representation). Consequently, the proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art self-supervised learning methods, such as Tile2Vec, MoCo, and SimCLR, in the cropland data layer (CDL), RESISC-45, UCMerced, and EuroSAT data sets. The proposed approach is comparable to the pretrained ImageNet model in the CDL classification task.",Remote sensing; Task analysis; Feature extraction; Satellites; Supervised learning; Image resolution; Head; Classification; contrastive learning; remote sensing; self-supervised learning; smoothed representation

Oil palm plantations require extensive fertilizer additions to achieve a high yield. Fertilizer application decisions and management for oil palm farming rely on leaf tissue and soil nutrient analyses with little information available to describe the key players for nutrient uptake. A molecular understanding of how nutrients, especially nitrogen (N), are taken up in oil palm is very important to improve fertilizer use and formulation practice in oil palm plantations. In this work, two nitrate uptake genes in oil palm, EgNRT2.3 and EgNAR2, were cloned and characterized. Spatial expression analysis showed high expression of these two genes was mainly found in un-lignified young roots. Interestingly, EgNRT2.3 and EgNAR2 were up-regulated by N deprivation, but their expression pattern depended on the form of N source. Promoter analysis of these two genes confirmed the presence of regulatory elements that support these expression patterns. The Xenopus oocyte assay showed that EgNRT2.3 and EgNAR2 had to act together to take up nitrate. The results suggest that EgNRT2.3 and EgNAR2 act as a two-component nitrate uptake system in oil palm.",NAR2; NRT2; Nitrogen deprivation; Oil palm; Two-component nitrate uptake system.

However, CRISPR methods generally rely on preassembled DNAs and extra cloning steps to deliver gRNA, Cas protein, and donor DNA. These laborious steps might hinder its usefulness. Here, we propose an alternative method, Assembly and CRISPR-targeted in vivo Editing (ACtivE), that only relies on in vivo assembly of linear DNA fragments for plasmid and donor DNA construction. Thus, depending on the user's need, these parts can be easily selected and combined from a repository, serving as a toolkit for rapid genome editing without any expensive reagent. The toolkit contains verified linear DNA fragments, which are easy to store, share, and transport at room temperature, drastically reducing expensive shipping costs and assembly time. After optimizing this technique, eight loci proximal to autonomously replicating sequences (ARS) in the yeast genome were also characterized in terms of integration and gene expression efficiencies and the impacts of the disruptions of these regions on cell fitness. The flexibility and multiplexing capacity of the ACtivE were shown by constructing a β-carotene pathway. In only a few days, >80% integration efficiency for single gene integration and >50% integration efficiency for triplex integration were achieved on Saccharomyces cerevisiae BY4741 from scratch without using in vitro DNA assembly methods, restriction enzymes, or extra cloning steps.

A diet containing 20% fish meal (FM) and complex plant ingredients as the main protein resources was set as the FM group (crude protein 32%, crude lipid 6%). Four diets replacing 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100% fish meal of the FM diet with PBM were set as the PBM25, PBM50, PBM75, and PBM100 groups, respectively. Compared to the FM group, the PBM100 diet significantly decreased growth performance and feed utilization of crayfish, while markedly increasing the activity of serum aspartate aminotransferase. The immune response was depressed in crayfish fed the PBM100 diet as the activities of serum lysozyme and phenoloxidase, gene expression of anti-lipopolysaccharide factors (alf), cyclophilin A (cypa), crustin, and hemocyanin-1 (hep-1) in hepatopancreas were remarkably decreased. The activities of antioxidases and expression of antioxidant-relevant genes in the hepatopancreas were not influenced by PBM inclusion. Crayfish fed different diets exhibited no obvious symptoms of enteritis, but the PBM100 diet destructed intestinal morphology by significantly decreasing the average length of longitudinal ridges. The α-diversity and overall community structure were not significantly influenced but variations were found in the relative abundance of some genera by PBM inclusion. In summary, CAP could successfully replace 75% dietary FM in a basal diet containing 20% fish meal, while higher CAP level compromised growth performance, immunity, and intestinal histology of crayfish.",Antioxidant capacity; Immune response; Intestinal microbiota; Intestinal morphology; Poultry by-product meal; Procambarus clarkia.

Samples were collected from six regions, once a year from 2013 to 2018. There appeared to be little variation in estimated daily intake and annual committed effective dose of 90Sr across the time periods and regions. The estimated maximum annual committed effective dose of 90Sr was 0.00076 mSv/year, a value sufficiently lower than the intervention exemption level, 1 mSv/year, in foods in Japan. There was no noticeable difference between the range of estimated daily intake of 90Sr in this study compared with daily intake measured before the FDNPP accident.

We propose a deterministic model to investigate the impact of such disruptive events on the transmission dynamics of the Ebola virus disease. It is an extension of the classical susceptible-infectious-recovered model, enriched by an additional class of contaminated environment to account for indirect transmission as well as two classes of hospitalized individuals and patients who escape from the healthcare facility due to violence and attacks perpetrated by armed groups, rebels, etc. The model is formulated using two patches, namely Patch 1 consisting of the three affected eastern provinces in DRC and Patch 2, a war- and conflict-free area consisting of the go-to neighboring provinces for escaped patients. We introduce two key parameters, the escaping rate from hospitals and the destruction of hospitals, in terms of which the effect of war and conflicts is measured. The model is fitted and parameterized using the cumulative mortality data from the region. The basic reproduction number [Formula: see text] is computed and found to have a complex expression due to the high nonlinearity of the model. By using, not a Lyapunov function, but a decomposition theorem in Castillo-Chavez et al.(in Castillo-Chavez et al. (eds) Mathematical approaches for emerging and reemerging infectious diseases: an introduction, vol 126.

A nonstandard finite difference scheme which replicates the dynamics of the continuous model is designed. In particular, a discrete counterpart of the above-mentioned theorem on the global asymptotic stability of the disease-free equilibrium is investigated. Numerical experiments are presented to support the theoretical results. When [Formula: see text], the numerical simulations suggest that there exists for the full model a unique globally asymptotically stable interior endemic equilibrium point, while it is shown theoretically and computationally that the model possesses at least a one Patch 1 and a one Patch 2 boundary equilibria (i.e., Patch 2 and Patch 1 disease-free equilibrium) points, which are locally asymptotically stable.

However, the existing deep neural networks are usually trained with a global loss, and all hidden layer weights have to be always kept in memory before the forward and backward pass has completed. The backward locking phenomenon prevents the reuse of memory, which is a crucial limitation for wearable activity recognition. In the paper, we proposed a layer-wise convolutional neural networks (CNN) with local loss for the use of HAR task. To our knowledge, this paper is the first that uses local loss based CNN for HAR in ubiquitous and wearable computing arena. We performed experiments on five public HAR datasets including UCI HAR dataset, OPPOTUNITY dataset, UniMib-SHAR dataset, PAMAP dataset, and WISDM dataset. The results show that local loss works better than global loss for tested baseline architectures. At no extra cost, the local loss can approach the state-of-the-arts on a variety of HAR datasets, even though the number of parameters was smaller. We believe that the layer-wise CNN with local loss can be used to update the existing deep HAR methods.",Machine learning; Activity recognition; Training; Feature extraction; Neural networks; Biological system modeling; Activity recognition; deep learning; convolutional neural networks; sensor; local loss

Cellphilms, participatory visual methods in research and teaching, are used to explore learning experiences for students and KKs, and the resulting cellphilms become places of knowledge transfer.

Unlike conventional vias, TSVs occupy device area and are very large compared to logic gates. However, most previous 3-D floorplanners only view TSVs as points.

In this paper, we propose a very efficient 3-D floorplanner to simultaneously floorplan the functional modules and place the TSVs and to optimize the total wirelength under fixed-outline constraint. Compared to the state-of-the-art 3-D floorplanner with TSV planning, our design consistently produces better floorplans with 15% shorter wirelength and 31% fewer TSVs on average.

Exposure to phosphate removes on average 64% of the microbial DNA from bone powder but only 37% of the endogenous DNA (from the organism under study), increasing the percentage of informative sequences by a factor of two on average. An average 4.6-fold increase, in one case reaching 24-fold, is achieved by sodium hypochlorite treatment, albeit at the expense of destroying 63% of the endogenous DNA preserved in the bone. While both pretreatment methods described here greatly reduce the cost of genome sequencing from ancient material due to efficient depletion of microbial DNA, we find that the removal of human DNA contamination remains a challenging problem.",DNA contamination removal; DNA extraction; ancient DNA; paleogenomics.
1437,Convolutional Neural Networks for Geo-Localisation with a Single Aerial Image,"Cabrera-Ponce, Aldrich A.; Martinez-Carranza, Jose","Nowadays, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) navigating outdoors rely heavily on GPS for localisation and autonomous flight or applications for aerial photography re-cording with a GPS coordinate. However, GPS may fail or become unreliable, thus compromising the flight mission. Motivated by this scenario, in this work, we present a study on the use of popular Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to address the problem of geo-localisation from a single aerial image. We compare CNN-based architectures from the state-of-the-art, and introduce a compact architecture to speed up the inference process without affecting the estimation error. For our experiments, aerial images were recorded with a monocular camera onboard a UAV, flying outdoors with a height between 20 to 25 metres. On average, our compact network achieves a minimum estimation error of 2.8 metres and a maximum of 6.1 metres, which is comparable to the performance of other networks in the state-of-the-art. However, our network achieves on average an operation frequency of 103 fps versus 69 fps achieved by the fastest network in the comparison analysis. These results are promising since such speed would enable fast geo-localisation with cameras capturing images at those frame rates, which are useful for obtaining neater images than with conventional cameras working at 30 fps.",Geo-localisation; Single Aerial Image; CNN; Deep Learning
1438,Dietary Intervention for Preventing Colorectal Cancer: A Practical Guide for Physicians,"Sang Hoon Kim,Jeong Yeon Moon,Yun Jeong Lim,Sang Hoon Kim,Jeong Yeon Moon,Yun Jeong Lim","Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a disease with high prevalence and mortality. Estimated preventability for CRC is approximately 50%, indicating that altering modifiable factors, including diet and body weight, can reduce CRC risk. There is strong evidence that dietary factors including whole grains, high-fiber, red and processed meat, and alcohol can affect the risk of CRC. An alternative strategy for preventing CRC is use of a chemopreventive supplement that provides higher individual exposure to nutrients than what can be obtained from the diet. These include calcium, vitamin D, folate, n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, and phytochemicals. Several intervention trials have shown that these dietary chemopreventives have positive protective effects on development and progression CRC. Research on chemoprevention with phytochemicals that possess anti-inflammatory and/or, anti-oxidative properties is still in the preclinical phase. Intentional weight loss by bariatric surgery has not been effective in decreasing long-term CRC risk. Physicians should perform dietary education for patients who are at high risk of cancer for changing their dietary habits and behaviour. An increased understanding of the role of individual nutrients linked to the intestinal micro-environment and stages of carcinogenesis would facilitate the development of the best nutritional formulations for preventing CRC.",Calcium; Chemoprevention; Colorectal neoplasms; Diet; Fatty acids; omega-3.

The initial N-glycan structure is synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) as a branched structure on a lipid anchor (dolicholpyrophosphate) and then co-translationally, ""en bloc"" transferred and linked via N-acetylglucosamine to asparagine within a specific N-glycosylation acceptor sequence of the nascent recipient protein. In the ER and then the Golgi apparatus, the N-linked glycan structure is modified by hydrolytic removal of sugar residues (""trimming"") followed by re-glycosylation with additional sugar residues (""processing"") such as galactose, fucose or sialic acid to form complex N-glycoproteins. While the sequence of the reactions leading to biosynthesis, ""en bloc"" transfer and processing of N-glycans is well investigated, it is still not completely understood how N-glycans affect the biological fate and function of N-glycoproteins. This review will discuss the biology of N-glycoprotein synthesis, processing and function with specific reference to the physiology and pathophysiology of the immune and nervous system, as well as infectious diseases such as Covid-19.",Chaperones; Congenital disorders of glycosylation; ERAD; Gangliosides; Glycolipids; Glycosyltransferases; N-glycans; N-glycoproteins; Processing; Trimming.
1440,An extensive evaluation of seven machine learning methods for rainfall prediction in weather derivatives,"Cramer, Sam; Kampouridis, Michael; Freitas, Alex A.; Alexandridis, Antonis K.","Regression problems provide some of the most challenging research opportunities in the area of machine learning, and more broadly intelligent systems, where the predictions of some target variables are critical to a specific application. Rainfall is a prime example, as it exhibits unique characteristics of high volatility and chaotic patterns that do not exist in other time series data. This work's main impact is to show the benefit machine learning algorithms, and more broadly intelligent systems have over the current state-of-the-art techniques for rainfall prediction within rainfall derivatives. We apply and compare the predictive performance of the current state-of-the-art (Markov chain extended with rainfall prediction) and six other popular machine learning algorithms, namely: Genetic Programming, Support Vector Regression, Radial Basis Neural Networks, M5 Rules, M5 Model trees, and k-Nearest Neighbours. To assist in the extensive evaluation, we run tests using the rainfall time series across data sets for 42 cities, with very diverse climatic features. This thorough examination shows that the machine learning methods are able to outperform the current state-of-the-art. Another contribution of this work is to detect correlations between different climates and predictive accuracy. Thus, these results show the positive effect that machine learning-based intelligent systems have for predicting rainfall based on predictive accuracy and with minimal correlations existing across climates.

In the present study, we paid a special interest in exploring the effect of Oct4 on colon cancer (CC) proliferation, migration, invasion, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and its molecular mechanism. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was used to detect the expression level of Oct4 in colon tissue of patients with colon cancer. Oct4 overexpression vector pcDNA-Oct4 was used to stably express Oct4 in human colon cancer cells HT29 and SW480. Cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) assay was used to detect the cell proliferation. The invasion and migration abilities were observed by transwell and wound healing assays. The expression of EMT relate genes were observed by Western blot. We found that Oct4 was up-regulated in human colon cancer tissues than that in paracancerous tissues. The proliferation, migration, and invasion of HT29 and SW480 cells was significantly induced by transfection of pcDNA-Oct4. Furthermore, Oct4 overexpression enhanced EMT of CC cells, characterized by the increased expression of vimentin, Twist, and Snail, as well as decreased expression of E-cadherin. Mechanistically, Oct4 overexpression activated stem cell factor (SCF)/c-Kit signaling pathway in CC cells, and the SCF/c-Kit signaling inhibitor imatinib reversed pro-oncogenic effects of Oct4. These finding provide an insight into the potential of Oct4 for CC diagnosis and therapy.",Colon cancer; Oct4; SCF/c-Kit signaling pathway.

Dynamic MRI requires rapid data acquisition for the study of moving organs such as the heart. We introduce a generalized version of the deep-image-prior approach, which optimizes the weights of a reconstruction network to fit a sequence of sparsely acquired dynamic MRI measurements. Our method needs neither prior training nor additional data. In particular, for cardiac images, it does not require the marking of heartbeats or the reordering of spokes. The key ingredients of our method are threefold: 1) a fixed low-dimensional manifold that encodes the temporal variations of images; 2) a network that maps the manifold into a more expressive latent space; and 3) a convolutional neural network that generates a dynamic series of MRI images from the latent variables and that favors their consistency with the measurements in k-space. Our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods quantitatively and qualitatively in both retrospective and real fetal cardiac datasets. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first unsupervised deep-learning-based method that can reconstruct the continuous variation of dynamic MRI sequences with high spatial resolution.",Accelerated MRI; unsupervised learning

H2O2 is known as a major reactive oxygen species (ROS) which is involve in numerous physiological processes such as cell proliferation, signal transduction, differentiation, and even pathogenesis. A plenty of diseases development such as chronic disease, inflammatory disease, and organ dysfunction are found to be relevant to abnormality of H2O2 production. Thus, imminent and feasible strategies to modulate and detect H2O2 level in vitro and in vivo have gained great importance. To date, the boronate-based chemical structure probes have been widely used to address the problems from the above aspects because of the rearranged chemical bonding which can detect and quantify ROS including hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and peroxynitrite (ONOO-).

Since 2009, a team incorporated in the Projet Collectif de Recherche ""Grotte de Cussac"", directed by J. Jaubert, has been engaged in the identification, inventory and study of these ""Activity Traces"" (TrAcs). The objective is to study the interactions of humans and animals with this subterranean environment and to understand how humans perceived this complex space. Our aim is to confront the data associated with these TrAcs with the information provided by other disciplines. This approach is made possible by the conditions of the discovery of the cave, which was left almost untouched since the Paleolithic, and the strict policy of conservation that has been implemented. The team explores the cave in a non-invasive manner, respecting the limits of a designated pathway while recording, describing, and photographing the accessible TrAcs. The areas that are currently inventoried show that human TrAcs are more frequent and diverse than those of animals, and consist mostly of prints, tracked surfaces and black and red marks. Most of the animal TrAcs were produced by bears, and consist mainly of claw marks covering large areas. These bear marks always predate the human activities. The presence of TrAcs, art and human remains shows that this entire subterranean environment was intensively frequented by both humans and bears. Our approach constitutes a fundamental step towards an understanding of the cave, and more generally, of the identity and culture of Gravettian groups, reflected here in their behavior, activities and occupations in the context of this complex site with monumental engravings and human remains.

Present study appraises the influence of human induced activities on groundwater quality of Agra-Firozabad industrial belts of Western Uttar Pradesh, Yamuna basin, India. The maximum concentrations of metals and anions found during pre and post monsoon are as follows: Lead 0.302; 0.086, calcium 672; 1260, magnesium 215; 16.8, cadmium 0.0; 0.066, chromium 0.016; 0.005, manganese 0.340; 0.076, nickel 0.044; 0.028, sulfate 514; 286, nitrate 66.7; 3.56 and fluoride 1.17; 2.02 mg/L respectively. Based on results of Water Quality Index, groundwater samples were classified under 'Poor water' category in 34.2% and 52.63% during pre and post-monsoon period, respectively. Accordingly, higher concentrations of bicarbonate and sulfate might have attributed to excess hardness, instrumental in making it unsuitable for industrial usage. However, values of Percent Sodium, Sodium Adsorption Ratio, Magnesium Hazard and Permeability Index signified that groundwater from majority of locations was fit for agricultural use. Health risk assessment studies revealed that children consuming polluted water were affected more as compared to adults.

Most state-ofthe-art methods are based on the encoder-decoder architecture. However, the existing methods mainly neglect problems of feature uncalibration within blocks and semantics dilution between blocks. In this work, we propose an unabridged adjacent modulation network (UAM-Net) to aggregate multi-level features for clothing parsing. We first build an unabridged channel attention (UCA) mechanism on feature maps within each block for feature recalibration. We further design a top-down adjacent modulation (TAM) for decoder blocks. By deploying TAM, high-level semantic information and visual contexts can be gradually transferred into lower-level layers without loss. The joint implementation of UCA and TAM ensures that the encoder has an enhanced feature representation ability, and the low-level features of the decoders contain abundant semantic contexts. Quantitative and qualitative experimental results on two challenging benchmarks (i.e., colorful fashion parsing and the modified fashion clothing) declare that our proposed UAM-Net can achieve competitive high-accurate performance with the state-of-the-art methods.

In the LBCNN, a convolutional layer is divided into two sublayers. Sublayer 1 is a sparse ternary-weighted convolutional layer, and Sublayer 2 is a 1x1 convolutional layer. With the use of two sublayers, the LBCNN has lower computational complexity and uses less memory than the CNN. In this brief, we propose a platform that includes a weight preprocessor and layer accelerator for the LBCNN. The proposed weight preprocessor takes advantage of the sparsity in the LBCNN and encodes the weight offline. The layer accelerator effectively uses the encoded data to reduce computational complexity and memory accesses for an inference. When compared to the state-of-the-art design, the experimental results show that the number of clock cycles are reduced by 76.32%, and memory usage is reduced by 39.41%. The synthesized results show that the clock period is reduced by 4.76%; the cell area is reduced by 46.48%, and the power consumption is reduced by 40.87%.

However, there is a lack of molecular tools for systematically interrogating how receptor oligomerization governs the signaling response. Here, we developed a DNA origami-templated aptamer nanoarray (DOTA) that enables precise programming of the oligomerization of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK) with defined valency, distribution, and stoichiometry at the ligand-receptor interface. The DOTA allows for advanced receptor manipulations by arraying either monomeric aptamer ligands (mALs) that oligamerize receptor monomers to elicit artificial signaling or dimeric aptamer ligands (dALs) that preorganize the receptor dimer to recapitulate natural activation. We demonstrated that the multivalency and nanoscale spacing of receptor oligomerization coordinately influence the activation level of receptor tyrosine kinase signaling. Furthermore, we illustrated that DOTA-modulated receptor oligomerization could function as a signaling switch to promote the transition from epithelia to mesenchymal-like cells, demonstrating robust control over cellular behaviors. Together, we present a versatile all-in-one DNA nanoplatform for the systematical investigation and regulation of receptor-mediated cellular response.",Aptamer ligand; Cellular behavior; DNA origami; Multivalency; Receptor oligomerization.

In the past decades, although some famous action datasets have been released, there still exist limitations, including the limited action categories and samples, camera views and variety of scenarios. Moreover, most of them are designed for a subset of the learning problems, such as single-view learning problem, cross-view learning problem and multi-task learning problem. In this paper, we introduce a multi-view, multi-modality benchmark dataset for human action recognition (abbreviated to MMA). MMA consists of 7080 action samples from 25 action categories, including 15 single-subject actions and 10 double-subject interactive actions in three views of two different scenarios. Further, we systematically benchmark the state-of-the-art approaches on MMA with respective to all three learning problems by different temporal-spatial feature representations. Experimental results demonstrate that MMA is challenging on all three learning problems due to significant intra-class variations, occlusion issues, views and scene variations, and multiple similar action categories.

We explored feedback from face-to-face workshops and the acceptability of an online approach utilizing information communication technology (ICT) to achieve greater service reach, satisfaction, and knowledge and related outcomes. Under the Hong Kong Jockey Club SMART Family-Link Project and in collaboration with Caritas Integrated Family Service Centre-Aberdeen, this study was conducted in two phases: a four-session, face-to-face workshop (phase one) and eleven online single-session workshops (phase two) from September 2019 to September 2020. A total of 305 participants joined the workshops. Phase one participants (n = 11) reported high satisfaction (4.7 out of 5), increases in knowledge (4.2/5) and confidence (3.9/5) towards managing stress, increases in knowledge (4.1/5) and confidence (3.9/5) in showing support and care towards family members, and an increase in knowledge towards strengthening family relationships (4.0/5).

Methylglyoxal (MG), a natural metabolite derived from glycolysis, has been shown to negatively influence systemic metabolism by inducing glucose intolerance, insulin resistance, and diabetic complications. MG plays a functional role as a signaling molecule that initiates signal transduction. However, the specific relationship between MG-induced activation of signal transduction and its negative effects on metabolism remains unclear. Here, we found that MG activated mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling via p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase in adipocytes, and that the transforming growth factor-β-activated kinase 1 (TAK1) is needed to activate p38-mTORC1 signaling following treatment with MG. We also found that MG increased the phosphorylation levels of serine residues in insulin receptor substrate (IRS)-1, which is involved in its negative regulation, thereby attenuating insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation in IRS-1. The negative effect of MG on insulin-stimulated IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation was exerted due to the MG-induced activation of the TAK1-p38-mTORC1 signaling axis. The involvement of the TAK1-p38-mTORC1 signaling axis in the induction of IRS-1 multiple serine phosphorylation was not unique to MG, as the proinflammatory cytokine, tumor necrosis factor-α, also activated the same signaling axis. Therefore, our findings suggest that MG-induced activation of the TAK1-p38-mTORC1 signaling axis caused multiple serine phosphorylation on IRS-1, potentially contributing to insulin resistance.",TAK1; adipocytes; insulin signalling; mTOR; methylglyoxal; signalling.

Patients were randomized to a single dose of 2.4 g CAS+IMD, 8.0 g CAS+IMD, or placebo. Patients seropositive for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies at baseline were analyzed by their baseline neutralizing antibody status. At baseline, 20.6% (178/864) of seropositive patients were negative or borderline for neutralizing antibodies, indicating negative or very low functionally neutralizing anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. CAS+IMD reduced viral load in patients who were negative or borderline for neutralizing antibodies versus placebo, but not in patients who were positive for neutralizing antibodies. In patients who were negative or borderline for neutralizing antibodies, we observed a trend in reduction of the proportion of patients who died or required mechanical ventilation, as well as in all-cause mortality, by day 29 with CAS+IMD versus placebo. The proportions of patients who died or required mechanical ventilation from days 1 to 29 were 19.1% in the placebo group and 10.9% in the CAS+IMD combined-dose group, and the proportions of patients who died (all-cause mortality) from days 1 to 29 were 16.2% in the placebo group and 9.1% in the CAS+IMD combined-dose group. In patients who were positive for neutralizing antibodies, no measurable harm or benefit was observed in either the proportion of patients who died or required mechanical ventilation or the proportion of patients who died (all-cause mortality). In hospitalized COVID-19 patients on low-flow or no supplemental oxygen, CAS+IMD reduced viral load, the risk of death or mechanical ventilation, and all-cause mortality in seropositive patients who were negative or borderline for neutralizing antibodies. IMPORTANCE The clinical benefit of CAS+IMD in hospitalized seronegative patients with COVID-19 has previously been demonstrated, although these studies observed no clinical benefit in seropositive patients. As the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2-seropositive individuals rises due to both vaccination and previous infection, it is important to understand whether there is a subset of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 with antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 who could benefit from anti-SARS-CoV-2 monoclonal antibody treatment. This post hoc analysis demonstrates that there is a subset of hospitalized seropositive patients with inadequate SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing antibodies (i.e., those who were negative or borderline for neutralizing antibodies) who may still benefit from CAS+IMD treatment if infected with a susceptible SARS-CoV-2 variant. Therefore, utilizing serostatus alone to guide treatment decisions for patients with COVID-19 may fail to identify those seropositive patients who could benefit from anti-SARS-CoV-2 monoclonal antibody therapies known to be effective against circulating strains, dependent upon how effectively their endogenous antibodies neutralize SARS-CoV-2.",COVID-19; anti-SARS-CoV-2 serostatus; casirivimab and imdevimab; hospitalized; monoclonal antibodies; neutralizing antibodies.

Here, we focus on the recent advances on the use of various nanomaterials for cancer treatment, including targeting cancer cell surfaces, tumor microenvironment (TME), organelles, and their mechanism of action. The paradigm shift in cancer management is achieved through the implementation of anticancer drug delivery using nano routes.",Drug delivery system; Mechanism of action; Nanomaterials; Targeting; Tumor microenvironment.

The influence that salinity has on organism physiology and the partitioning of hydrophobic chemicals, such as pyrethroids, has driven interest in how toxicity changes in saltwater compared to freshwater. Early life exposures in fish to pyrethroids cause toxicity at environmentally relevant concentrations, which can alter behavior. Behavior is a highly sensitive endpoint that influences overall organism fitness and can be used to detect toxicity of environmentally relevant concentrations of aquatic pollutants. Inland Silversides (Menidia beryllina), a commonly used euryhaline model fish species, were exposed from 5 days post fertilization (~1-day pre-hatch) for 96 h to six pyrethroids: bifenthrin, cyfluthrin, cyhalothrin, cypermethrin, esfenvalerate and permethrin. Exposures were conducted at three salinities relevant to brackish, estuarine habitat (0.5, 2, and 6 PSU) and across 3 concentrations, either 0.1, 1, 10, and/or 100 ng/L, plus a control. After exposure, Inland Silversides underwent a behavioral assay in which larval fish were subjected to a dark and light cycle stimuli to determine behavioral toxicity. Assessment of total distanced moved and thigmotaxis (wall hugging), used to measure hyper/hypoactivity and anxiety like behavior, respectively, demonstrate that even at the lowest concentration of 0.1 ng/L pyrethroids can induce behavioral changes at all salinities. We found that toxicity decreased as salinity increased for all pyrethroids except permethrin. Additionally, we found evidence to suggest that the relationship between log KOW and thigmotaxis is altered between the lower and highest salinities.",Climate change; Drought; Ecotoxicology; Insecticide; Marine; Menidia beryllina.

Current state-of-the-art numerical techniques are based on differential formulations such as the finite element method. A formulation based on volume integral equations has not yet been applied to its biomedical field and could improve the reconstruction speed by reducing the number of unknowns.

1459,SCGAN: Saliency Map-Guided Colorization With Generative Adversarial Network,"Zhao, Yuzhi; Po, Lai-Man; Cheung, Kwok-Wai; Yu, Wing-Yin; Rehman, Yasar Abbas Ur","Given a grayscale photograph, the colorization system estimates a visually plausible colorful image. Conventional methods often use semantics to colorize grayscale images. However, in these methods, only classification semantic information is embedded, resulting in semantic confusion and color bleeding in the final colorized image. To address these issues, we propose a fully automatic Saliency Map-guided Colorization with Generative Adversarial Network (SCGAN) framework. It jointly predicts the colorization and saliency map to minimize semantic confusion and color bleeding in the colorized image. Since the global features from pre-trained VGG-16-Gray network are embedded to the colorization encoder, the proposed SCGAN can be trained with much less data than state-of-the-art methods to achieve perceptually reasonable colorization. In addition, we propose a novel saliency map-based guidance method. Branches of the colorization decoder are used to predict the saliency map as a proxy target. Moreover, two hierarchical discriminators are utilized for the generated colorization and saliency map, respectively, in order to strengthen visual perception performance. The proposed system is evaluated on ImageNet validation set. Experimental results show that SCGAN can generate more reasonable colorized images than state-of-the-art techniques.",Image color analysis; Semantics; Gray-scale; Hemorrhaging; Training; Generative adversarial networks; Task analysis; Colorization; generative adversarial network; saliency map
1460,Automated Radiographic Report Generation Purely on Transformer: A Multicriteria Supervised Approach,"Wang, Zhanyu; Han, Hongwei; Wang, Lei; Li, Xiu; Zhou, Luping","Automated radiographic report generation is challenging in at least two aspects. First, medical images are very similar to each other and the visual differences of clinic importance are often fine-grained. Second, the disease-related words may be submerged by many similar sentences describing the common content of the images, causing the abnormal to be misinterpreted as the normal in the worst case. To tackle these challenges, this paper proposes a pure transformer-based framework to jointly enforce better visual-textual alignment, multi-label diagnostic classification, and word importance weighting, to facilitate report generation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first pure transformer-based framework for medical report generation, which enjoys the capacity of transformer in learning long range dependencies for both image regions and sentence words. Specifically, for the first challenge, we design a novel mechanism to embed an auxiliary image-text matching objective into the transformer's encoder-decoder structure, so that better correlated image and text features could be learned to help a report to discriminate similar images. For the second challenge, we integrate an additional multi-label classification task into our framework to guide the model in making correct diagnostic predictions. Also, a term-weighting scheme is proposed to reflect the importance of words for training so that our model would not miss key discriminative information. Our work achieves promising performance over the state-of-the-arts on two benchmark datasets, including the largest dataset MIMIC-CXR.",Transformers; Visualization; Medical diagnostic imaging; Feature extraction; Task analysis; Decoding; Training; Medical report generation; image caption; transformer; image-text matching

This work was undertaken to address the unmet need for a permanent and unified object specific sensory and digital data labelling system for fine art objects that does not require large-scale wireless infrastructure. The sensor-tags are demonstrated in a six-month pilot study to evaluate the temperature and humidity buffering performance of a microclimate enclosure (MCE) constructed to protect a late C16th panel painting. The framed painting fitted with NFC sensor-tags was hung in a busy, and environmentally uncontrolled, Cambridge college dining hall to mimic a typically large, semipublic exhibition space. The resulting visibility of climatic conditions and the detailed analytics made possible from the data sets harvested from the NFC sensor-tags have provided invaluable information to the painting conservators.

We explored the experiences of pregnant women living with HIV (PWLHIV) not yet on ART who received VITAL Start before ART initiation to assess the intervention's acceptability, feasibility, fidelity of delivery, and perceived impact. Between February and September 2019, we conducted semi-structured interviews with a convenience sample of 34 PWLHIV within one month of receiving VITAL Start. The participants reported that VITAL Start was acceptable and feasible and had good fidelity of delivery. They also reported that the video had a positive impact on their lives, encouraging them to disclose their HIV status to their sexual partners who, in turn, supported them to adhere to ART. The participants suggested using a similar intervention to provide health-related education/counseling to people with long term conditions. Our findings suggest that video-based interventions may be an acceptable, feasible approach to optimizing ART retention and adherence amongst PWLHIV, and they can be delivered with high fidelity. Further exploration of the utility of low cost, scalable, video-based interventions to address health counseling gaps in sub-Saharan Africa is warranted.",VITAL Start; HIV; adherence; retention; Malawi; sub-Saharan Africa; acceptability

Initially, climate change scenarios were coupled with state-of-the-art hurricane genesis, wind field, and tracking models to examine possible changes in hurricane intensity (maximum wind speed) and hurricane size (radius to maximum winds). A number of different postulated climate change models (IPCC scenarios) were considered. Each scenario suggested changes in sea surface temperature (SST), which is the driving parameter in most modern hurricane models. The evolution of hurricane genesis frequency was then considered both independently and jointly with hurricane intensification. State-of-the-art probabilistic event modeling and simulation techniques were used to generate 10,000 years of hurricane events under the 2005 and future climate conditions. The annual maximum wind speed distribution and the joint distribution of maximum wind speed and storm size, under 2005 and future climate scenarios, are then compared. Finally, the evolution of hurricane tracks was examined in an effort to establish a trend over time.

The present study used data from a prospective cohort design study to examine the stability of social support from childhood through middle adulthood in individuals with documented histories of childhood abuse and neglect and matched controls (aged 0-11) and assessed the impact of social support on allostatic load, a composite measure of physiological stress response assessed through blood tests and physical measurements, in middle adulthood. Maltreated children are more likely to have unstable social support across the life span, compared to matched controls. Social support across the life span partially mediated the relationship between child maltreatment and allostatic load in adulthood, although there were differences by race and sex. These findings have implications for interventions to prevent the negative consequences of child maltreatment.",allostatic load; child abuse and neglect; physical health; social support.

Similarly, music art is losing its function of expressing nature and ecology. The sustainable development of ecological environment is of great significance to the sustainable development of music. The development of music art is inseparable from the objective existence of music function and people's deepening aesthetic understanding of it. Therefore, music aesthetic education must be based on the original concept, guided by ecological philosophy, and learn from the concept of ecological aesthetics to reconstruct the overall function of music aesthetic education. This paper focuses on how to innovate and develop music, how to spread the value of ecological culture, and how to lead the value of ecological culture. From the perspective of music workers, this paper explores the essential requirements of music aesthetic education and the construction and development of ecological culture, so as to explore the important significance of the integration of traditional ecological culture and music aesthetic education.",natural ecology; ecological carrier; ecological philosophy; music aesthetic education

These techniques use photon time-of-flight information encoded in light after multiple, diffuse reflections to reconstruct a three-dimensional scene. In this paper, we propose and describe two iterative backprojection algorithms, the additive error backprojection (AEB) and multiplicative error backprojection (MEB), whose goal is to improve the reconstruction of the scene under investigation over non-iterative backprojection algorithms. We evaluate the proposed algorithms' performance applied to simulated and real data (gathered from an experimental setup where the system needs to reconstruct an unknown scene). Results show that the proposed iterative algorithms are able to provide better reconstruction than the unfiltered, non-iterative backprojection algorithm for both simulated and physical scenes, but are more sensitive to errors in the light transport model.",Non-line-of-sight (NLOS) imaging; time-of-flight; seeing-around-corners; algebraic reconstruction technique (ART); kaczmarz method

In the event of X chromosome inactivation, robust epigenetic marks are established in a long noncoding Xist RNA-dependent manner, giving rise to a distinct epigenetic landscape on the inactive X chromosome (Xi). The X inactivation center (Xic) is essential for induction of X chromosome inactivation and harbors two topologically associated domains (TADs) to regulate monoallelic Xist expression: one at the noncoding Xist gene and its upstream region, and the other at the antisense Tsix and its upstream region. The monoallelic expression of Xist is tightly regulated by these two functionally distinct TADs as well as their constituting lncRNAs and proteins. In this review, we summarize recent updates in our knowledge of lncRNAs found at the Xic and discuss their overall mechanisms of action. We also discuss our current understanding of the molecular mechanism behind Xist RNA-mediated induction of the repressive epigenetic landscape at the Xi.

To develop effective agents to control SVCV infection, we selected 16 naturally active small molecules to assess their anti-SVCV activity. Notably, dihydroartemisinin (DHA) (100 µmol/L) and (S, S)-(+)-tetrandrine (TET) (16 µmol/L) exhibited high antiviral effects in epithelioma papulosum cyprinid (EPC) cells, with inhibitory rates of 70.11% and 73.54%, respectively. The possible antiviral mechanisms were determined as follows: 1. Pre-incubation with DHA and TET decreased viral particle infectivity in fish cells, suggesting that horizontal transmission of SVCV in the aquatic environment was disrupted; 2. Although neither had an effect on viral adhesion, TET (but not DHA) interfered with SVCV entry into host cells (>80%), suggesting that TET may have an antiviral function in early viral replication. For in vivo study, both agents enhanced the survival rate of SVCV-infected zebrafish by 53.3%, significantly decreased viral load, and modulated the expression of antiviral-related genes, indicating that DHA and TET may stimulate the host innate immune response to prevent viral infection. Overall, our findings indicated that DHA and TET had positive effects on suppressing SVCV infection by affecting early-stage viral replication, thus holding great potential as immunostimulants to reduce the risk of aquatic rhabdovirus disease outbreaks.",Antiviral effects; Danio rerio; Natural small molecules; Spring viremia of carp virus; Virus internalization.

Teeth are positioned in the alveolar bone in a particular order, featuring similar appearances across adjacent and bilaterally symmetric teeth. However, existing tooth segmentation methods ignored such specific anatomical topology, which hampers the segmentation accuracy. Here we propose a semantic graph-based method to explicitly model the spatial associations between different anatomical targets (i.e., teeth) for their precise delineation in a coarse-to-fine fashion. First, to efficiently control the bilaterally symmetric confusion in segmentation, we employ a lightweight network to roughly separate teeth as four quadrants. Then, designing a semantic graph attention mechanism to explicitly model the anatomical topology of the teeth in each quadrant, based on which voxel-wise discriminative feature embeddings are learned for the accurate delineation of teeth boundaries. Extensive experiments on a clinical dental CBCT dataset demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method compared with other state-of-the-art approaches.",Teeth; Image segmentation; Dentistry; Semantics; Task analysis; Shape; Knowledge based systems; Tooth segmentation; semantic graph attention; anatomical association modeling; CBCT images

We conducted an observational prospective cohort study of 468 patients living with HIV (PLWHIV) under dolutegravir (DTG) in all health facilities in Bunia between July 2019 and July 2021. Kaplan-Meier plots were used to determine the probability of LTFU as a function of time as inclusive of the cohort. The main outcome variable was LTFU, defined as not taking an ART refill for a period of 3 months or longer from the last attendance for refill, and not yet classified as 'dead' or 'transferred-out.' The log-rank test was used to compare survival curves based on predictors. Cox proportional hazard modeling was used to measure predictors of LTFU from the baseline until 31 July 2021 (the endpoint). A total of 3435.22 person-months (p-m) were involved in follow up, with an overall incidence rate of 33.48 LTFU per 1000 p-m. Patients who had less experience with ART at enrolment and the ethnically Sudanese, had a higher hazard of being LTFU compared to their reference groups. This study reports a high LTFU rate in this conflict setting. An ART program in such a setting should pay more attention to naive patients and other particularly vulnerable patients such as Sudanese during the pre-ART phase. The study implies the implementation of innovative strategies to address this high risk of being LTFU, reducing either the cost or the distance to the health facility.",armed conflict; anti-retroviral therapy; HIV patient loss to follow up; Bunia; RDC

Malware can have highly diversified features, each of which has highly heterogeneous distributions. These factors increase the difficulties for traditional data analytic approaches to deal with them. Although deep learning based methods have reported good classification performance, the deep models usually lack interpretability and are fragile under adversarial attacks. To solve these problems, fuzzy systems have become a competitive candidate in malware analysis. In this article, a new fuzzy-based approach is proposed for malware classification. We focused on portable executable files in the Windows platform and analyzed the distributions of static features and content-oriented features. Fuzzification was used to reduce the ubiquitous impact of noise and outliers in a very large dataset. Finally, a novel boosted classifier consisted of fuzzy decision trees and support vector machine is proposed to perform the malware classification. By using fuzzy decision trees, the inner structure of the classifier can be readily interpreted as discriminative rules, whereas the novel boosting strategy provides state-of-the-art classification performance. Extensive experimental results showed that our method significantly outperformed several state-of-the-art classifiers.",Malware; Feature extraction; Machine learning; Decision trees; Forestry; Support vector machines; Boosted random forest; computer security; fuzzy decision tree; malware classification
1474,LSTM-MSNet: Leveraging Forecasts on Sets of Related Time Series With Multiple Seasonal Patterns,"Bandara, Kasun; Bergmeir, Christoph; Hewamalage, Hansika","Generating forecasts for time series with multiple seasonal cycles is an important use case for many industries nowadays. Accounting for the multiseasonal patterns becomes necessary to generate more accurate and meaningful forecasts in these contexts. In this article, we propose long short-term memory multiseasonal net (LSTM-MSNet), a decomposition-based unified prediction framework to forecast time series with multiple seasonal patterns. The current state of the art in this space is typically univariate methods, in which the model parameters of each time series are estimated independently. Consequently, these models are unable to include key patterns and structures that may be shared by a collection of time series. In contrast, LSTM-MSNet is a globally trained LSTM network, where a single prediction model is built across all the available time series to exploit the cross-series knowledge in a group of related time series. Furthermore, our methodology combines a series of state-of-the-art multiseasonal decomposition techniques to supplement the LSTM learning procedure. In our experiments, we are able to show that on data sets from disparate data sources, e.g., the popular M4 forecasting competition, a decomposition step is beneficial, whereas, in the common real-world situation of homogeneous series from a single application, exogenous seasonal variables or no seasonal preprocessing at all are better choices. All options are readily included in the framework and allow us to achieve competitive results for both cases, outperforming many state-of-the-art multiseasonal forecasting methods.",Time series analysis; Forecasting; Predictive models; Artificial neural networks; Industries; Load modeling; Market research; Long short-term memory (LSTM); multiple seasonality; neural networks (NNs); recurrent neural network (RNN); time-series forecasting

Whereas whole-genome sequencing (WGS) is the current gold standard to confirm infection clusters, PCR-based assays targeting cluster-specific signatures, such as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) derived from WGS data, are more suitable to initially screen for cluster isolates within large sample sizes. Here, we evaluated four software tools (SeqSphere+, RUCS, Gegenees, and Find Differential Primers) regarding their efficiency to find SNPs within WGS data sets that were specific for two bacterial monospecies infection clusters but were absent from a WGS reference data set comprising several hundred diverse genotypes of the same bacterial species. Cluster-specific SNPs were subsequently used to establish a probe-based real-time PCR screening assay for in vitro differentiation between cluster and noncluster isolates. SeqSphere+ and RUCS found 2 and 24 SNPs for clusters 1 and 14 and 24 SNPs for cluster 2, respectively. However, some signatures detected by RUCS were not cluster specific. Interestingly, all SNPs identified by SeqSphere+ were also detected by RUCS. In contrast, analyses with the remaining tools either resulted in no SNPs (with Find Differential Primers) or failed (Gegenees). Design of six cluster-specific real-time PCR assays enabled reliable cluster screening in vitro. Our evaluation revealed that SeqSphere+ and RUCS identified cluster-specific SNPs that could be used for large-scale screening in surveillance samples via real-time PCR, thereby complementing WGS efforts. This faster and simplified approach for the surveillance of bacterial clusters will improve infection control measures and will enhance protection of patients and physicians. IMPORTANCE Infection clusters of multidrug-resistant bacteria threaten medical facilities worldwide and cause immense health care costs. In recent years, whole-genome sequencing (WGS) has been increasingly applied to detect and to further control bacterial clusters. However, as WGS is still expensive and time-consuming, its exclusive application for screening and confirmation of bacterial infection clusters contributes to high costs and enhanced turnaround times, which many hospitals cannot afford. Therefore, there is need for alternative methods that can enable further surveillance of bacterial clusters that are initially detected by WGS in a faster and more cost-efficient way. Here, we established a system based on real-time PCR that enables rapid large-scale sample screening for bacterial cluster isolates within 7 days after the initial detection of an infection cluster, thereby complementing WGS efforts. This faster and simplified surveillance of bacterial clusters will improve infection control measures and will enhance protection of patients and physicians.",cluster detection; genome sequencing; real-time PCR; signature search; single nucleotide polymorphisms; software evaluation.

In this study, we used a virus titer method to screen 30 small molecules for antiviral activity against Herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV-1). We found that the small molecule RAF265, an anticancer drug that has been shown to be a potent inhibitor of B-RAF V600E, reduced viral loads of HSV-1 by 4 orders of magnitude in Vero cells and reduced virus proliferation in vivo. RAF265 mediated cytoskeleton rearrangement and targeted the host cell's translation machinery, which suggests that the antiviral activity of RAF265 may be attributed to a dual inhibition strategy.

1478,Reweighted sparse subspace clustering,"Xu, Jun; Xu, Kui; Chen, Ke; Ruan, Jishou","Motion segmentation and human face clustering are two fundamental problems in computer vision. The state-of-the-art algorithms employ the subspace clustering scheme when processing the two problems. Among these algorithms, sparse subspace clustering (SSC) achieves the state-of-the-art clustering performance via solving a l(1) minimization problem and employing the spectral clustering technique for clustering data points into different subspaces. In this paper, we propose an iterative weighting (reweighted) l(1) minimization framework which largely improves the performance of the traditional l(1) minimization framework. The reweighted l(1) minimization framework makes a better approximation to the to minimization than tradition l(1) minimization framework. Following the reweighted l(1) minimization framework, we propose a new subspace clustering algorithm, namely, reweighted sparse subspace clustering (RSSC). Through an extensive evaluation on three benchmark datasets, we demonstrate that the proposed RSSC algorithm significantly reduces the clustering errors over the SSC algorithm while the additional reweighted step has a moderate impact on the computational cost. The proposed RSSC also achieves lowest clustering errors among recently proposed algorithms. On the other hand, as majority of the algorithms were evaluated on the Hopkins155 dataset, which is insufficient of non-rigid motion sequences, the dataset can hardly reflect the ability of the existing algorithms on processing non-rigid motion segmentation. Therefore, we evaluate the performance of the proposed RSSC and state-of-the-art algorithms on the Freiburg-Berkeley Motion Segmentation Dataset, which mainly contains non-rigid motion sequences. The performance of these state-of-the-art algorithms, as well as RSSC, will drop dramatically on this dataset with mostly non-rigid motion sequences. Though the proposed RSSC achieves the better performance than other algorithms, the results suggest that novel algorithms that focus on segmentation of non-rigid motions are still in need.

1481,A 26.5 pA(rms) Neurotransmitter Front-End With Class-AB Background Subtraction,"Ying, Da; Rosenberg, Joshua; Singh, Naveen K.; Hall, Drew A.","This paper presents an analog front-end (AFE) for fast-scan cyclic voltammetry (FSCV) with analog background subtraction using a pseudo-differential sensing scheme to cancel the large non-faradaic current before seeing the front-end. As a result, the AFE can be compact and low-power compared to conventional FSCV AFEs with dedicated digital back-ends to digitize and subtract the background from subsequent recordings. The reported AFE, fabricated in a 0.18-mu m CMOS process, consists of a class-AB common-mode rejection circuit, a low-input-impedance current conveyor, and a 1st-order current-mode delta-sigma (Delta Sigma) modulator with an infinite impulse response quantizer. This AFE achieves an effective dynamic range of 83 dB with a state-of-the-art 39.2 pA(rms) input-referred noise when loaded with a 1 nF input capacitance (26.5 pA(rms) open-circuit) across a 5 kHz bandwidth while consuming an average power of 3.7 mu W.

1482,Exercise Dependence in Practitioners of Martial Arts and Combat Sports,"Kostorz, Karolina; Cynarski, Wojciech J.; Polechonski, Jacek","Background: The aim of this study was to analyse prevalence exercise dependence among practicing martial arts and combat sports. Methods: There were 166 respondents. The Exercise Dependence Scale-EDS was used. Results: The martial arts practitioners obtained a lower result in the 'intention effects' (p < 0.05; eta(2) = 0.03), 'continuance' (p = 0.04; eta(2) = 0.03), 'lack of control' (p < 0.05; eta(2) = 0.03), 'reduction in other activities' (p = 0.04; eta(2) = 0.03), and 'total score' (p = 0.04; eta(2) = 0.03) than the combat sports athletes. Both the respondents with a high training rank (p < 0.05) and subjects with above 5 years of training experience (p = 0.03; eta(2) = 0.03) achieved the higher mean in the 'time' subscale. Women obtained lower results in the case of 'tolerance' (p = 0.04; eta(2) = 0.04). The regression coefficient indicates that the higher respondent's age, the lower total score she/he will achieve in the EDS. Conclusions: The findings have practical implications for identifying subjects 'at-risk for exercise dependence' symptoms, and may aid coaches and individuals in the implementation of a prevention program, to seek suitable support.",behavioral addiction; exercise addiction; hand-to-hand fights athletes; competition; physical activity
1483,Self-Powered Signal Transduction of Ion-Selective Electrodes to an Electronic Paper Display,"Yaotian Wu,Eric Bakker,Yaotian Wu,Eric Bakker","Mobile integrated electrochemical sensors normally require a power supply for operation. Unfortunately, the practice of discarding batteries associated with these devices runs counter to our desire for a sustainable world. Self-powered sensing concepts that draw the energy directly from the measurement itself would overcome this limitation. Potentiometric sensors for the measurement of pH, many electrolytes, and gases are ubiquitous in analytical practice. However, in potentiometry, the voltage is acquired in the absence of current flow, making it seemingly impossible to draw power. Fortunately, it has been recently established that transient currents may be tolerated across potentiometric measurement cells to charge a capacitive or electrochromic element such as Prussian blue integrated in the measurement cell and whose absorbance then directly follows the potential changes in a reversible manner. We have shown here that commercial electronic paper (e-paper), widely used to make electronic ink and ebook readers, can directly be driven by a potentiometric measurement cell in a reversible manner at mild potentials of >100 mV typical for such sensors. The capacitance of the e-paper pixel studied here was found to be 0.53 μF mm-2, 30 times smaller than that of Prussian blue films. The colorimetric absorbance of the e-paper was also more stable (observed drift over 2 h corresponding to 0.76 mV h-1) and reproducible (corresponding to 1 mV standard deviation). The e-paper pixel was directly driven by a polymeric pH electrode as a model system. Choosing a basic inner solution (pH 12.9) behind the membrane gave sufficiently positive cell potentials for driving visible absorbance change in a sample pH range of 4-10, while a more acidic pH of 3.4 and alternating the connections to the e-paper were more suited for more basic samples of pH > 10. This convenient and cost-effective approach makes it possible to directly drive an optical display from the potentiometric measurement itself and should be suitable for moderate sensing membrane resistances of less than about 100 kΩ, depending on the area of the chosen pixel.",capacitive display; e-paper; ion-selective electrode; potentiometry; self-powered sensor.

BM-derived stem cells circulate always at steady-state conditions in PB, and their number increases during stress situations related to (a) infections, (b) tissue organ injury, (c) stress, and (d) strenuous exercise. Stem cells also show a circadian pattern of their PB circulating level with peak in early morning hours and nadir late at night. The number of circulating in PB stem cells could be pharmacologically increased after administration of some drugs such as cytokine granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) or small molecular antagonist of CXCR4 receptor AMD3100 (Plerixafor) that promote their egress from BM into PB and lymphatic vessels. Circulating can be isolated from PB for transplantation purposes by leukapheresis. This important homeostatic mechanism is governed by several intrinsic complementary pathways. In this chapter, we will discuss the role of purinergic signaling and extracellular nucleotides in regulating this process and review experimental strategies to study their involvement in mobilization of various types of stem cells that reside in murine BM.",Mobilization; Mouse models; Purinergic signaling; Stem cells.

It is difficult to achieve functional recovery for the damaged central nervous system (CNS) because of its limited ability to regenerate. Glycosphingolipids (GSLs) are abundant in the CNS and are known to play essential roles in cell-cell recognition, adhesion, signal transduction, and cellular migration, that are crucial in all phases of neurogenesis. Despite intense investigation of CNS regeneration, the roles of GSLs in neural regeneration remain unclear. Here we focus on the respective potentials of glycolipids to promote regeneration and repair of the CNS. Mice lacking glucosylceramide, lactosylceramide or gangliosides show lethal phenotypes. More importantly, patients with ganglioside deficiencies exhibit severe clinical phenotypes. Further, neurodegenerative diseases and mental health disorders are associated with altered GSL expression. Accumulating studies demonstrate that GSLs not only delimit physical regions but also play central roles in the maintenance of the biological functions of neurons and glia. We anticipate that the ability of GSLs to modulate behavior of a variety of molecules will enable them to ameliorate biochemical and neurobiological defects in patients. The use of GSLs to treat such defects in the human CNS will be a paradigm-shift in approach since GSL-replacement therapy has not yet been achieved in this manner clinically.",Carbohydrate; Ganglioside; Glycoconjugate; Glycolipid; Glycosphingolipid; Mental health disorder; Neural development; Neural stem cell; Neurodegenerative disease; Neurogenesis; Neurological disorder; Regeneration.
1486,MTT: Multi-Scale Temporal Transformer for Skeleton-Based Action Recognition,"Kong, Jun; Bian, Yuhang; Jiang, Min","In the task of skeleton-based action recognition, long-term temporal dependencies are significant cues for sequential skeleton data. State-of-the-art methods rarely have access to long-term temporal information, due to the limitations of their receptive fields. Meanwhile, most of the recent multiple branches methods only consider different input modalities but ignore the information in various temporal scales. To address the above issues, we propose a multi-scale temporal transformer (MTT) in this letter, for skeleton-based action recognition. Firstly, the raw skeleton data are embedded by graph convolutional network (GCN) blocks and multi-scale temporal embedding modules (MT-EMs), which are designed as multiple branches to extract features in various temporal scales. Secondly, we introduce transformer encoders (TE) to integrate embeddings and model the long-term temporal pattern. Moreover, we propose a task-oriented lateral connection (LaC) aiming to align semantical hierarchies. LaC distributes input embeddings to the downstream transformer encoders (TE), according to semantical levels. The classification headers aggregate results from TE and predict the action categories at last. The proposed method is shown efficiency and universality during experiments and achieves the state-of-the-art on three large datasets, NTU-RGBD 60, NTU-RGBD 120 and Kinetics-Skeleton 400.",Feature extraction; Transformers; Kernel; Skeleton; Data mining; Task analysis; Convolution; Skeleton-based action recognition; transformer; lateral connection; multi-scale temporal embedding

Here, we generated whole-genome sequencing data from native goat populations in Iraq and Pakistan. Combined with previously published data on modern, ancient (Late Neolithic to Medieval periods), and wild Capra species worldwide, we explored the genetic population structure, ancestry components, and signatures of natural positive selection in native goat populations in Southwest Asia (SWA). Results revealed that the genetic structure of SWA goats was deeply influenced by gene flow from the eastern Mediterranean during the Chalcolithic period, which may reflect adaptation to gradual warming and aridity in the region. Furthermore, comparative genomic analysis revealed adaptive introgression of the KITLG locus from the Nubian ibex ( C. nubiana) into African and SWA goats. The frequency of the selected allele at this locus was significantly higher among goat populations located near northeastern Africa. These results provide new insights into the genetic composition and history of goat populations in the SWA region.",Adaptation; Goat; KITLG; Nubian ibex; Southwest Asia.

This often arises with real-time imaging modalities such as ultrasound, where poor contrast can make tissue boundaries difficult to distinguish from surrounding tissue. Missing data poses two challenges: ambiguity in establishing correspondences; and extrapolation of the deformation field to those missing regions. To address these, we present a novel non-rigid registration method. For establishing correspondences, we use a probabilistic framework based on a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) that treats one surface as a potentially partial observation. To extrapolate and constrain the deformation field, we incorporate biomechanical prior knowledge in the form of a finite element model (FEM). We validate the algorithm, referred to as GMM-FEM, in the context of prostate interventions. Our method leads to a significant reduction in target registration error (TRE) compared to similar state-of-the-art registration algorithms in the case of missing data up to 30%, with a mean TRE of 2.6 mm. The method also performs well when full segmentations are available, leading to TREs that are comparable to or better than other surface-based techniques. We also analyze robustness of our approach, showing that GMM-FEM is a practical and reliable solution for surface-based registration.",Finite element model; Gaussian mixture model; prostate; surface registration; transrectal ultrasound

An original and very efficient method to obtain hundreds of complementary LSTM RNN extracted from a single training, calledcohort, is proposed. The proposed approach achieves new state-of-the art performance on the Rimes and IAM datasets, and provides 90% of accuracy on the Rimes dataset when dealing with a gigantic lexicon record of 3 millions of words.

Nanoneedles can deliver p16-targeting siRNA to primary human corneal endothelial cells in vitro without toxicity. The nanoinjection of siRNA induces p16 silencing and increases cell proliferation, as monitored by ki67 expression.

Control charts have an important role in solving quality control problems; nevertheless, their effectiveness is strictly dependent on statistical assumptions that in real industrial applications are frequently violated. In contrast, neural networks can elaborate huge amounts of noisy data in real time, requiring no hypothesis on statistical distribution of monitored measurements. This important feature makes neural networks potential tools that can be used to improve data analysis in manufacturing quality control applications. In this paper, a neural network system, which is based on an unsupervised training phase, is presented for quality control. In particular, the adaptive resonance theory (ART) has been investigated in order to implement a model-free quality control system, which can be exploited for recognising changes in the state of a manufacturing process. The aim of this research is to analyse the performances of ART neural network under the assumption that predictable unnatural patterns are not available.

1499,A Flexible and Robust Threshold Selection Method,"Wang, Zhenzhou; Xiong, Jingjing; Yang, Yongming; Li, Haixing","Despite the great prosperity and fast development of image segmentation technology, threshold selection method is still the best choice in many practical applications. The state-of-the-art threshold selection methods perform poorly in segmenting many images with different modalities, such as the magnetic resonance images, cell images, and laser line images. Thus, it is desirable to come up with a more robust method that could segment images with different modalities with the optimum accuracy. To this end, the method should be flexible and its parameters should be adjustable for different types of images. In this paper, we propose to compute the threshold based on the slope difference distribution, which is computed from the image histogram with adjustable parameters. First, the pixels are clustered based on the peaks of the slope difference distribution into different pixel classes. Second, the threshold is selected based on the valleys of the slope difference distribution to separate the pixel classes. The robustness of this threshold selection method relies on the adjustable parameters that could be calibrated to achieve the optimum segmentation accuracy for each specific type of images. The proposed threshold selection method is tested on both the synthesized images and the real images. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods as a whole.",Threshold selection; clustering; image segmentation; slope difference distribution
1500,Learning semantic ambiguities for zero-shot learning,"Hanouti, Celina; Le Borgne, Herve","Zero-shot learning (ZSL) aims at recognizing classes for which no visual sample is available at training time. To address this issue, one can rely on a semantic description of each class. A typical ZSL model learns a mapping between the visual samples of seen classes and the corresponding semantic descriptions, in order to do the same on unseen classes at test time. State of the art approaches rely on generative models that synthesize visual features from the prototype of a class, such that a classifier can then be learned in a supervised manner. However, these approaches are usually biased towards seen classes whose visual instances are the only one that can be matched to a given class prototype. We propose a regularization method that can be applied to any conditional generative-based ZSL method, by leveraging only the semantic class prototypes. It learns to synthesize discriminative features for possible semantic description that are not available at training time, that is the unseen ones. The approach is evaluated for ZSL and GZSL on four datasets commonly used in the literature, either in inductive or transductive settings, with results on-par or above state of the art approaches.

Most existing methods rely on complex, trained linguistic analyzers, and thus likely have unsatisfactory performance on text corpora of new domains and genres without extra but expensive adaption. None of the state-of-the-art models, even data-driven models, is fully automated because they require human experts for designing rules or labeling phrases. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for automated phrase mining, AutoPhrase, which supports any language as long as a general knowledge base (e.g., Wikipedia) in that language is available, while benefiting from, but not requiring, a POS tagger. Compared to the state-of-the-art methods, AutoPhrase has shown significant improvements in both effectiveness and efficiency on five real-world datasets across different domains and languages.

However, most existing learning-based approaches usually suffer from limited manually annotated medical data, which poses a major practical problem for accurate and robust medical image segmentation. In addition, most existing semi-supervised approaches are usually not robust compared with the supervised counterparts, and also lack explicit modeling of geometric structure and semantic information, both of which limit the segmentation accuracy. In this work, we present SimCVD, a simple contrastive distillation framework that significantly advances state-of-the-art voxel-wise representation learning. We first describe an unsupervised training strategy, which takes two views of an input volume and predicts their signed distance maps of object boundaries in a contrastive objective, with only two independent dropout as mask. This simple approach works surprisingly well, performing on the same level as previous fully supervised methods with much less labeled data. We hypothesize that dropout can be viewed as a minimal form of data augmentation and makes the network robust to representation collapse. Then, we propose to perform structural distillation by distilling pair-wise similarities. We evaluate SimCVD on two popular datasets: the Left Atrial Segmentation Challenge (LA) and the NIH pancreas CT dataset. The results on the LA dataset demonstrate that, in two types of labeled ratios (i.e., 20% and 10%), SimCVD achieves an average Dice score of 90.85% and 89.03% respectively, a 0.91% and 2.22% improvement compared to previous best results. Our method can be trained in an end-to-end fashion, showing the promise of utilizing SimCVD as a general framework for downstream tasks, such as medical image synthesis, enhancement, and registration.",Image segmentation; Biomedical imaging; Task analysis; Data models; Training; Representation learning; Annotations; Medical image segmentation; contrastive learning; knowledge distillation; geometric constraints

Numerous attempts have been made to integrate these features in a software package/platform so that the user may compute a wide range of features from a single source. To complement the existing methods, we developed a method, Pfeature, for computing a wide range of protein features. Pfeature allows to compute more than 200,000 features required for predicting the overall function of a protein, residue-level annotation of a protein, and function of chemically modified peptides. It has six major modules, namely, composition, binary profiles, evolutionary information, structural features, patterns, and model building. Composition module facilitates to compute most of the existing compositional features, plus novel features. The binary profile of amino acid sequences allows to compute the fraction of each type of residue as well as its position. The evolutionary information module allows to compute evolutionary information of a protein in the form of a position-specific scoring matrix profile generated using Position-Specific Iterative Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (PSI-BLAST); fit for annotation of a protein and its residues. A structural module was developed for computing of structural features/descriptors from a tertiary structure of a protein. These features are suitable to predict the therapeutic potential of a protein containing non-natural or chemically modified residues. The model-building module allows to implement various machine learning techniques for developing classification and regression models as well as feature selection.

However, cameras can present a limited angular resolution, becoming a bottleneck in vision applications. Thus, there is a challenge to incorporate angular data due to disparities in the LF images. In recent years, different machine learning algorithms have been applied to both image processing and ITS research areas for different purposes. In this work, a Lightweight Deformable Deep Learning Framework is implemented, in which the problem of disparity into LF images is treated. To this end, an angular alignment module and a soft activation function into the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) are implemented. For performance assessment, the proposed solution is compared with recent state-of-the-art methods using different LF datasets, each one with specific characteristics. Experimental results demonstrated that the proposed solution achieved a better performance than the other methods. The image quality results obtained outperform state-of-the-art LF image reconstruction methods. Furthermore, our model presents a lower computational complexity, decreasing the execution time.",light field imaging; deep learning framework; image quality; computational complexity; intelligent transportation systems

A distance function determines how similar the objects are to a given kNN query object. As finding the distance between any given pair of objects (i.e., high-dimensional vectors) is known to be a computationally expensive operation, using parallel computation techniques is an effective way of reducing running times to acceptable values in large databases. In the present work, we offer novel GPU approaches to solving kNN (k-nearest neighbor) queries using exhaustive algorithms based on the Selection Sort, Quicksort and state-of-the-art algorithms. We show that the best approach depends on the k value of the kNN query and achieve a speedup up to 86.4 better than the sequential counterpart. We also propose a multi-core algorithm to be used as reference for the experiments and a hybrid algorithm which combines the proposed algorithms with a state-of-the-art heaps-based method, in which the best performance is obtained with high k values. We also extend our algorithms to be able to deal with large databases that do not fit in GPU memory and whose performance does not deteriorate as database size increases.",kNN; Quicksort; Selection Sort; GPU; Exhaustive algorithms
1509,ImageGCN: Multi-Relational Image Graph Convolutional Networks for Disease Identification With Chest X-Rays,"Mao, Chengsheng; Yao, Liang; Luo, Yuan","Image representation is a fundamental task in computer vision. However, most of the existing approaches for image representation ignore the relations between images and consider each input image independently. Intuitively, relations between images can help to understand the images and maintain model consistency over related images, leading to better explainability. In this paper, we consider modeling the image-level relations to generate more informative image representations, and propose ImageGCN, an end-to-end graph convolutional network framework for inductive multi-relational image modeling. We apply ImageGCN to chest X-ray images where rich relational information is available for disease identification. Unlike previous image representation models, ImageGCN learns the representation of an image using both its original pixel features and its relationship with other images. Besides learning informative representations for images, ImageGCN can also be used for object detection in a weakly supervised manner. The experimental results on 3 open-source x-ray datasets, ChestX-ray14, CheXpert and MIMIC-CXR demonstrate that ImageGCN can outperform respective baselines in both disease identification and localization tasks and can achieve comparable and often better results than the state-of-the-art methods.",Image representation; Diseases; X-ray imaging; Biomedical imaging; Image edge detection; Task analysis; Message passing; Chest X-ray; graph convolutional network; graph learning; image representation; relation modeling

Female ginseng (Angelica sinensis) is a renowned herb with abundant coumarins, originated in China and known for the treatment of female ailments for thousands of years. The molecular basis of simple coumarin biosynthesis in A. sinensis and the evolutionary history of the genes involved in furanocoumarin biosynthesis are largely unknown. Here, we generated the first chromosome-scale genome of A. sinensis. It has a genome size of 2.37 Gb, which was generated by combining PacBio and Hi-C sequencing technologies. The genome was predicted to contain 43 202 protein-coding genes dispersed mainly on 11 pseudochromosomes. We not only provided evidence for whole-genome duplication (WGD) specifically occurring in the Apioideae subfamily, but also demonstrated the vital role of tandem duplication for phenylpropanoid biosynthesis in A. sinensis. Combined analyses of transcriptomic and metabolomic data revealed key genes and candidate transcription factors regulating simple coumarin biosynthesis. Furthermore, phylogenomic synteny network analyses suggested prenyltransferase genes involved in furanocoumarin biosynthesis evolved independently in the Moraceae, Fabaceae, Rutaceae and Apiaceae after ζ and ε WGD.

Traditionally, this task is performed by formulating a linear regression problem. Recently, it is found that using a linear sparse regression model can achieve better prediction accuracy. However, most existing studies only focus on the exploitation of sparsity of regression coefficients, ignoring useful structure information in regression coefficients. Also, these linear sparse models may not capture more complicated and possibly nonlinear relationships between cognitive performance and MRI measures. Motivated by these observations, in this work we build a sparse multivariate regression model for this task and propose an empirical sparse Bayesian learning algorithm. Different from existing sparse algorithms, the proposed algorithm models the response as a nonlinear function of the predictors by extending the predictor matrix with block structures. Further, it exploits not only inter-vector correlation among regression coefficient vectors, but also intra-block correlation in each regression coefficient vector. Experiments on the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative database showed that the proposed algorithm not only achieved better prediction performance than state-of-the-art competitive methods, but also effectively identified biologically meaningful patterns.",Alzheimer's disease (AD); cognitive Impairment; neuroimaging; sparse Bayesian learning (SBL)

Since the relationship between Luminal B (HER2-) BC and liver metastasis (LM) is poorly defined, this retrospective study aimed to develop an LM risk nomogram for patients with lymph node-related (N + Luminal B [HER2-]) BC. Methods: Data were obtained for patients initially diagnosed with BC from the Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute and Hospital. There were 30,975 Chinese female patients with stage I-III BC and follow-up confirming 1217 subsequent patients with LM, and 427 patients with N + Luminal B (HER2-). The LM risk was assessed using Cox proportional hazards regression, histogram, Venn diagram, and Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, with further analysis for patients with N + Luminal B (HER2-) BC. A nomogram was established based on the N + Luminal B (HER2-) BC data, which was validated using calibration plots. Results: The median age of 427 patients with N + Luminal B (HER2-) liver metastasis of breast cancer (BCLM) was 49 years. The largest number of patients with BCLM was diagnosed between the second to the 6th year, the longest interval from initial BC diagnosis to subsequent LM was 145 months. The patients with LM as the first site of distant metastasis which is associated with better survival were analyzed by Kaplan-Meier. The nomogram was constructed for the risk of LM that included age, menstrual status, unilateral oophorectomy, pregnancy, hepatitis B antigen, region of residence, tumor size, lymph node, clavicular lymph nodes, progesterone receptor, and lymph vessel invasion. Conclusion: We described the clinicopathological characteristics of patients with stage I-III BC, and constructed a nomogram for calculating personalized LM probabilities for patients with N + Luminal B (HER2-), which could guide future prolonged or early extensive treatment decisions.",Chinese female patient; breast cancer; liver metastasis; luminal B(HER2−); lymph node positive; nomogram.

To address this, we propose Adobe Boxes to efficiently locate the potential objects with fewer proposals, in terms of searching the object adobes that are the salient object parts easy to be perceived. Because of the visual difference between the object and its surroundings, an object adobe obtained from the local region has a high probability to be a part of an object, which is capable of depicting the locative information of the proto-object. Our approach comprises of three main procedures. First, the coarse object proposals are acquired by employing randomly sampled windows. Then, based on local-contrast analysis, the object adobes are identified within the enlarged bounding boxes that correspond to the coarse proposals. The final object proposals are obtained by converging the bounding boxes to tightly surround the object adobes. Meanwhile, our object adobes can also refine the detection rate of most state-of-the-art methods as a refinement approach. The extensive experiments on four challenging datasets (PASCAL VOC2007, VOC2010, VOC2012, and ILSVRC2014) demonstrate that the detection rate of our approach generally outperforms the state-of-the-art methods, especially with relatively small number of proposals.

This paper focuses on a special class of algorithms that do not use virtual channels. One of the major challenges is to keep the network deadlock free in the presence of faults, especially those locating on network edges. State-of-the-art solutions address this problem by either disabling all nodes of the faulty network edges or including all faults into one faulty block. Therefore, a large number of fault-free nodes will be sacrificed. To address this problem, the proposed ZoneDefense routing not only includes faults into convex faulty blocks but also spreads the faulty blocks' position information in corresponding columns. The nodes, which know the position of faulty blocks, form the defense zones. Therefore, packets can find the faulty blocks and route around them in advance. Exploiting the defense zones, the proposed ZoneDefense routing could tolerate many more faults with significantly reduced sacrificed fault-free nodes compared with the state-of-the-art algorithms. Furthermore, the ZoneDefense routing does not degrade the network performance in the absence of faults, and could get similar performance as its counterparts in the presence of faults.",Fault-tolerant routing; mesh; network-on-chip (NoC); reconfigurable router; turn model

This study aimed to develop an effective heat treatment that could achieve a >5-log reduction of Salmonella inoculated on alfalfa seeds while maintaining seed viability and vigor. Effects of seeds' water activity (aw) and heat treatment temperature on Salmonella inactivation and seed viability were determined. Alfalfa seeds were dip-inoculated with a four-strain Salmonella cocktail and dried to aw of 0.05-0.20. The inoculated seeds were then placed in sealed glass tubes and heated at 65.9, 71.0, and 76.6 °C for up to 180 h. Increasing aw of seeds greatly improved thermal inactivation of Salmonella. For example, to achieve a >5-log reduction of Salmonella on seeds, treatment times of 140 and 60 h at 71.0 °C were required for aw of 0.1 and 0.2, respectively. Treatment temperature also greatly affected inactivation of Salmonella on alfalfa seeds. For example, to achieve a >5-log reduction of Salmonella on seeds with aw of 0.2, treatment times of 180 and 60 h were required for temperatures of 65.9 and 71.0 °C, respectively. Seeds' aw was critical for preserving seed viability. When seeds were treated at 71.0 °C for 60 h, increasing aw from 0.1 to 0.2 decreased the sprout yield ratio from 103.9 % to 73.7 %. Treatment of seeds with aw of 0.1 at 71.0 °C was found to be optimum for achieving a desirable Salmonella inactivation level while maintaining seed viability, resulting in 4.2 and 6.0 log reductions of Salmonella and yield ratios of 100.7 % and 96.1 % after 100- and 140-h treatments, respectively. This optimum heat treatment was compared with the traditional 20,000-ppm chlorine wash in terms of Salmonella inactivation and preservation of seed viability and found to be a far superior disinfection method.

The optimal design of deep neural networks (DNNs) for these systems often require expert knowledge and empirical evaluation. In this paper, a range of neural architecture search (NAS) techniques are used to automatically learn two types of hyper-parameters of factored time delay neural networks (TDNN-Fs): i) the left and right splicing context offsets; and ii) the dimensionality of the bottleneck linear projection at each hidden layer. These techniques include the differentiable neural architecture search (DARTS) method integrating architecture learning with lattice-free MMI training; Gumbel-Softmax and pipelined DARTS methods reducing the confusion over candidate architectures and improving the generalization of architecture selection; and Penalized DARTS incorporating resource constraints to balance the trade-off between performance and system complexity. Parameter sharing among TDNN-F architectures allows an efficient search over up to 7(28) different systems. Statistically significant word error rate (WER) reductions of up to 1.2% absolute and relative model size reduction of 31% were obtained over a state-of-the-art 300-hour Switchboard corpus trained baseline LF-MMI TDNN-F system featuring speed perturbation, i-Vector and learning hidden unit contribution (LHUC) based speaker adaptation as well as RNNLM restoring. Performance contrasts on the same task against recent end-to-end systems reported in the literature suggest the best NAS auto-configured system achieves state-of-the-art WERs of 9.9% and 11.1% on the NIST HubS' 00 and Rt03 s test sets respectively with up to 96% model size reduction. Further analysis using Bayesian learning shows that the proposed NAS approaches can effectively minimize the structural redundancy in the TDNN-F systems and reduce their model parameter uncertainty.

First, we infer the target location using multichannel correlation maps, resulting from the combination of five learned correlation filters with convolutional features. In order to handle the illumination variation and get more rich features, we exploit an HSV energy condition to control the use of two color spaces, RGB and HSV. Second, we use the histogram of gradient features to learn another correlation filter in order to estimate the scale variation. Furthermore, we exploit an online training SVM classifier for target re-detecting in failure cases.

OSA can induce cognitive and behavioral and mood deficits. Male C57Bl/6J 8-week-old mice were housed in custom-designed cages with a silent motorized mechanical sweeper traversing the cage floor at 2-min intervals (SF) during daylight for four weeks. Sleep control (SC) consisted of keeping sweeper immobile. IH consisted of cycling FiO2 21% 90 seconds-6.3% 90s or room air (RA; FiO2 21%) for sixteen weeks and combined SF-IH was conducted for nine weeks. Open field novel object recognition (NOR) testing, elevated-plus maze test (EPMT), and forced swimming test (FST) were performed. SF induced cognitive NOR performance impairments in mice along with reduced anxiety behaviors while IH induced deficits in NOR performance, but increased anxiety behaviors. SF-IH induced impaired performance in NOR test of similar magnitude to IH or SF alone. Combined SF-IH exposures did not affect anxiety behaviors. Thus, both SF an IH altered cognitive function while imposing opposite effects on anxiety behaviors. SF-IH did not magnify the detrimental effects of isolated SF or IH and canceled out the effects on anxiety. Based on these findings, the underlying pathophysiologic processes underlying IH and SF adverse effects on cognitive function appear to differ, while those affecting anxiety counteract each other.",Behaviors; Elevated plus maze test; Forced swimming test; Intermittent hypoxia; Novel object recognition; Obstructive sleep apnea; Sleep fragmentation.

Herein, different process conditions to reduce edge elevations at the lateral edges of water-based, shear-thinning coatings in the production of LIB electrodes are presented. The reduction of edge elevations is transferred from state-of-the-art electrodes to high-capacity electrodes. The developed process configuration greatly reduces reject caused by cutting off the edge areas in the industrial roll-to-roll process for electrode production. Compared with state-of-the art electrodes, the reject rate for high-capacity electrode production is significantly higher because the edge geometry in crossweb direction of the electrodes is wider. An optimization can be achieved by a combined adjustment of the coating gap and the slot-die angle to the substrate (angle of attack) to affect the pressure field in the coating bead. Therefore, a systematic investigation and optimization of these process parameters are presented. In addition, the investigation of the process stability of the coating is required. Based on this optimization, a reduction of edge elevations for high-capacity electrode coatings (5 mAh cm(-2)) of 69% and ultrathick high-capacity electrode coatings (7 mAh cm(-2)) of 48% is possible.",edge formation; electrode production; high-capacity electrodes; lithium-ion batteries; slot-die coating

1527,Multiple feature kernel hashing for large-scale visual search,"Liu, Xianglong; He, Junfeng; Lang, Bo","Recently hashing has become attractive in large-scale visual search, owing to its theoretical guarantee and practical success. However, most of the state-of-the-art hashing methods can only employ a single feature type to learn hashing functions. Related research on image search, clustering, and other domains has proved the advantages of fusing multiple features. In this paper we propose a novel multiple feature kernel hashing framework, where hashing functions are learned to preserve certain similarities with linearly combined multiple kernels corresponding to different features. The framework is not only compatible with general types of data and diverse types of similarities indicated by different visual features, but also general for both supervised and unsupervised scenarios.

1528,Prior Guided Feature Enrichment Network for Few-Shot Segmentation,"Tian, Zhuotao; Zhao, Hengshuang; Shu, Michelle; Yang, Zhicheng; Li, Ruiyu; Jia, Jiaya","State-of-the-art semantic segmentation methods require sufficient labeled data to achieve good results and hardly work on unseen classes without fine-tuning. Few-shot segmentation is thus proposed to tackle this problem by learning a model that quickly adapts to new classes with a few labeled support samples. Theses frameworks still face the challenge of generalization ability reduction on unseen classes due to inappropriate use of high-level semantic information of training classes and spatial inconsistency between query and support targets. To alleviate these issues, we propose the Prior Guided Feature Enrichment Network (PFENet). It consists of novel designs of (1) a training-free prior mask generation method that not only retains generalization power but also improves model performance and (2) Feature Enrichment Module (FEM) that overcomes spatial inconsistency by adaptively enriching query features with support features and prior masks. Extensive experiments on PASCAL-5(i) and COCO prove that the proposed prior generation method and FEM both improve the baseline method significantly. Our PFENet also outperforms state-of-the-art methods by a large margin without efficiency loss. It is surprising that our model even generalizes to cases without labeled support samples.",Few-shot segmentation; few-shot learning; semantic segmentation; scene understanding
1529,"Electrocution - post-mortem presentations, problems and pitfalls","Roger W Byard,Roger W Byard","Deaths due to electrocution occur when there has been passage of an electric current through the body. Lethal mechanisms may involve the heart with ventricular fibrillation, or the respiratory muscles or brainstem respiratory centres with respiratory paralysis/cessation. The size of the current that flows through the body is directly dependent on the potential difference of the circuit and the resistance of the tissues. The majority of deaths are accidental, with suicides being less common and homicides being very rare. Problems arising in the evaluation of cases include situations where electrocution has clearly occurred from the scene findings, but no injuries are detectable at autopsy, or when electrical burns are found at autopsy with no defective equipment/circuitry identified at the death scene.",Burns; Death; Electric current; Electrocution; Lightning; Target lesion.
1530,Use of muralism to promote awareness about aquatic ecosystems and wise water consumption in northwestern Ecuador,"Sanchez, Estefania; Vinueza, Ruben; Izurieta, Xiomara; Rey, Nuria","In this article, we present the results of the use of muralism as an artistic tool applied to environmental education with a focus on the promotion of awareness of aquatic ecosystems and rationed water consumption in the province of Esmeraldas in northwestern Ecuador. The research was conducted by an interdisciplinary team of professors and students from the Pontificia Universidad Catolica del Ecuador Sede Esmeraldas between 2017 and 2018 with the support of mural artists. The project involved a target audience in participating in the design and painting of four large-format murals with graphic representations of the ecosystems and people's relationship to water. The murals were developed in four different locations in the city where they could be viewed and appreciated by the community in general. One corner of each of these murals was deliberately left blank to serve as a slate where people could reflect and leave their comments. Pre- and post-test surveys were administered to the participants of this study and then evaluated and analyzed using McNemar statistics to measure the changes in participants' knowledge, awareness, and attitude. The reaction of the public to the murals was also part of the study. Their interaction was analyzed using a qualitative evaluation matrix specifically designed for this project. The results obtained in this study show that the use of mural art is an effective tool for environmental education programs. Murals represent a place for interaction; therefore, they become effective spaces for expressing and communicating messages. The impact of murals on awareness of aquatic ecosystems and use of water were more significant in children and teenagers because people are more receptive at a young age. The rest of the target groups participating in the study, although stimulated by the murals, presented minor changes in their responses. The public's reaction to the murals was extremely positive. The results showed that murals that depicted elements relating people's identity to the ecosystem helped reconnect them with nature and reminded them of their responsibility to conserve it. Thus, mural art can serve as a pedagogical tool for environmental education, helping communities connect with the environmental reality and encouraging them to commit to conservation through tangible work.",Art; Environmental education; Ecuador; Muralism; Ocean resources; Water conservation

In this study, we constructed six mutants of Ctenopharyngodon idella MDA5 (CiMAD5) overexpression plasmids and generated stable transfected C. idella kidney (CIK) cell lines to study the function of different domains of CiMAD5. After ploy(I:C) stimulation, the downstream genes of CiMDA5 in transfected cells was repressed. Overexpression of CiMDA5 or its variant repressed the replication of grass carp reovirus (GCRV) in CIK cells and decreased the viral titer of GCRV more or less compared to that in control cells. After GCRV or bacterial pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) stimulation, overexpression of CiMDA5 or CARD domain significantly induced the expression of CiIFN-I, CiIL-1β and CiMx1. The deletion of Helicase or RD domain reduced the inductive effect of CiMDA5 on CiIFN-I, CiIL-1β and CiMx1 expression. RD overexpression resulted in an enhanced expression of CiIFN-I, CiIL-1β and CiMx1. These observations collectively demonstrate that, in CIK cells, after GCRV or bacterial PAMPs stimulation, CARD domain alone can mediate signaling; Helicase or RD domain alone negatively regulates CARD function by intramolecular interaction with CARD. However, RD domain acts as an enhancer by intermolecular interaction. These results enlarge the response spectrum of MDA5 and contribute to a further understanding of the functions of MDA5 and its domains in evolution.",CIK cells; GCRV; Grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idella); MDA5; RLR pathway.

Various types of huma-machine interfaces have been implemented, including smart keyboards, electronic skins, and wearable motion sensors. Handwriting behavior has a high degree of interaction freedom, and handwriting characteristics offer high-security standards for human-machine systems. Herein, we propose a portable smart pen integrated with triboelectric displacement vector sensors to trace handwriting trajectories for human-machine interactions and biometric identification. A triboelectric pressure sensor array is evenly distributed along the pen case to sense displacement vectors, and an additional triboelectric sensor is placed on top of the pen to detect vertical force. By leveraging the resin pen refill as a tribopositive material and a nanowired polyethylene tribonegative layer attached to a Cu electrode, triboelectric signals are generated during the writing/moving process. The calculation and analysis of the sensor signals enable the recognition of handwritten patterns, including Latin letters and Arabic numerals. Moreover, the smart pen can be used to authenticate users based on their unique handwriting patterns, which can help take human-machine interfaces and cyber security to the next level. Furthermore, a custom smart pen operation mode that enables the control of a slide presentation demonstrates the smart pen's potential for various human-machine interface applications.",biometric identification; handwriting recognition; human−machine interface; smart pen; triboelectric effects.

First, the commitment to ""know more"" must examine the full ecology of relationship violence and sexual misconduct (RVSM); that knowledge is essential for creating multilevel prevention strategies. Second, a full realization of an intersectional perspective requires attention to a broader range of power-based harms, forging institutional links between RVSM prevention and work on diversity, equity, and inclusion. Third, while support for survivors is certainly vital, most people who experience harm do not report it, and so an ambitious approach to prevention is vital to building communities in which everyone can thrive.",ecological model; intersectionality; prevention; public health; sexual assault.
1534,How to Effectively Reduce Tens of Millions of Tests: An Industrial Case Study on Adaptive Random Testing,"Zhang, Zhiyi; Wang, Yabin; Wang, Ziyuan; Qian, Ju","Running and analyzing a large number of tests in an industrial scenario is labor intensive and time consuming. Hence, it is necessary to select a smaller number of tests for cost reduction as well as fault detection. For a type of nonnumeric systems, the linear-order algorithm for adaptive random testing (ART) (LART) technique is proposed by making tests evenly spread in nonnumeric input domains. To further enhance LART in the industrial scenarios where the number of input categories is too large, a new technique called category selection-based ART (CSBART), in which partial categories are selected to calculate tests' distances to guide LART, is proposed in this article. The fault-coverage effectiveness of CSBART is evaluated via an empirical study on two large scale billing systems with tens of millions of test cases, and the results demonstrate the promising performance of the proposed CSBART. We also find that, after category selection, CSBART can outperform a more complex and widespread n-per cluster sampling technique that uses K-means clustering to certain extents.",Adaptive random testing (ART); category choices; category selection; industrial system; test reduction

DKV stores provide simplistic primitives to access data based on the primary key of the stored objects. To help programmers to efficiently retrieve data, some DKV stores provide distributed indexes. Besides that, and also to simplify programming such applications, several proposals have provided strong consistency abstractions via distributed transactions. In this paper we present STI-BT, a highly scalable, transactional index for Distributed Key-Value stores. STI-BT is organized as a distributed B(+)Tree and adopts an innovative design that allows to achieve high efficiency in large-scale, elastic DKV stores. As such, it provides both the desirable properties identified above, and does so in a far more efficient and scalable way than the few existing state of the art proposals that also enable programmers to have strongly consistent distributed transactional indexes. We have implemented STI-BTon top of an open-source DKV store and deployed it on a public cloud infrastructure. Our extensive study demonstrates scalability in a cluster of 100 machines, and speed ups with respect to state of the art up to 5.4x.",Secondary index; distributed transactions; key-value data-store; data locality; B plus tree; strong consistency

We assessed the link between racial prejudice against Black and Native Americans and police militarization at individual and regional levels. Study 1 (N = 765) recruited a nationally representative sample of White Americans and found a positive association between racial prejudice and support for police militarization. Study 2 (N = 3,129,343) sourced regional aggregates of prejudice among White Americans from Project Implicit and policing data from the Defense Logistics Agency and found that police departments in states higher in prejudice acquired greater amounts of militarized equipment.

S.","Additive manufacturing (AM) has emerged as a disruptive digital manufacturing technology. However, its broad adoption in industry is still hindered by high entry barriers of design for additive manufacturing (DfAM), limited materials library, various processing defects, and inconsistent product quality. In recent years, machine learning (ML) has gained increasing attention in AM due to its unprecedented performance in data tasks such as classification, regression and clustering. This article provides a comprehensive review on the state-of-the-art of ML applications in a variety of AM domains. In the DfAM, ML can be leveraged to output new high-performance metamaterials and optimized topological designs. In AM processing, contemporary ML algorithms can help to optimize process parameters, and conduct examination of powder spreading and in-process defect monitoring. On the production of AM, ML is able to assist practitioners in pre-manufacturing planning, and product quality assessment and control. Moreover, there has been an increasing concern about data security in AM as data breaches could occur with the aid of ML techniques. Lastly, it concludes with a section summarizing the main findings from the literature and providing perspectives on some selected interesting applications of ML in research and development of AM.",Additive manufacturing; Process; Machine learning; Production; Design

The proposed architecture consists of two branches of DCNNs to map the high and low resolution face images into a common space with nonlinear transformations. The branch corresponding to transformation of high resolution images consists of 14 layers and the other branch which maps the low resolution face images to the common space includes a 5-layer super-resolution network connected to a 14-layer network. The distance between the features of corresponding high and low resolution images are backpropagated to train the networks. Our proposed method is evaluated on FERET, LFW, and MBGC datasets and compared with state-of-the-art competing methods. Our extensive experimental evaluations show that the proposed method significantly improves the recognition performance especially for very low resolution probe face images (5% improvement in recognition accuracy). Furthermore, it can reconstruct a high resolution image from its corresponding low resolution probe image which is comparable with the state-of-the-art super-resolution methods in terms of visual quality.

1540,Primary membranous nephropathy: an endless story,"Ponticelli Claudio,Ponticelli Claudio","Primary membranous nephropathy (PMN) is an autoimmune disease caused by the attack of autoantibodies against podocyte antigens leading to the in situ production of immune complexes. However, the etiology is unknown and the pathogenesis is still far from being completely elucidated. MN is prevalently idiopathic or primary, but in about 20-30% of cases it is secondary to chronic infections, systemic diseases, exposure to drugs, or malignancy. The differentiation between primary and secondary MN may be difficult, particularly when MN precedes signs and symptoms of the original disease, as in some cases of cancer or systemic lupus erythematosus. The natural course of PMN is variable, but in the long term 40-60% of patients with nephrotic syndrome progress to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) or die from thrombotic or cardiovascular events. PMN is a treatable disease. Patients with asymptomatic proteinuria should receive supportive care. Immunosuppressive treatments should be given to patients with nephrotic syndrome or risk of progression. The most frequently adopted treatments rely on cyclical therapy alternating steroids with a cytotoxic agent every other month, i.e., rituximab at different doses, or calcineurin inhibitors plus low-dose steroids. A good rate of response may be obtained but relapses can occur. Randomized controlled trials, with adequate size, long-term follow-up, and fair definition of endpoints are needed to identify treatment with the best therapeutic index.",Calcineurin inhibitors; Cyclical regimen; Membranous nephropathy; Nephrotic syndrome; Rituximab.

DRL shows advantages over traditional methods both on scalability and computation efficiency. However, the DRL problems transformed from CO problems usually have a huge state space, and the main challenge of solving them has changed from high computation complexity to high sample complexity. Credit assignment determines the contribution of each internal decision to the final success or failure, and it has been shown to be effective in reducing the sample complexity of the training process. In this paper, we resort to a model-based reinforcement learning method to assign credits for model-free DRL methods. Since heuristic methods plays an important role on state-of-the-art solutions for CO problems, we propose using a model to represent those heuristic knowledge and derive the credit assignment from the model. This model-based credit assignment can facilitate the model-free DRL to perform a more effective exploration, and the data collected by the model-free DRL refines the model continuously as the training progresses. Extensive experiments on various CO problems with different settings show that our framework outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods on performance and training efficiency.

A multi-stage stratified cluster random sampling approach was used to realize 11,130 participants 15 years and older. Logistic regression analysis assessed the association between multiple sexual partners, condom use at last sexual encounter, consistency of condom usage and potential explanatory variables using HIV status and ART exposure as a mediator variable. HIV positive participants who were aware and on ART were less likely to have multiple sexual partners, and less likely not to use a condom at last sex compared to HIV positive participants who were aware but not on ART. The odds of reporting multiple sexual partners were significantly lower among older age groups, females, non-Black Africans, and rural settings, and higher among those with tertiary level education, and risky alcohol users. The odds of no condom use at last sexual encounter were more likely among older age groups, females, other race groups, and less likely among those with secondary level education. The odds of inconsistent condom use were more likely among older age groups, females, and other race groups, and less likely among those with tertiary level education, high risk and hazardous alcohol users. Risk compensation is not apparent among HIV infected adults who are on ART.

As there is no direct view or access to the affected anatomy, advanced imaging techniques such as 3D C-arm computed tomography (CT) and C-arm fluoroscopy are routinely used in clinical practice for intraoperative guidance. However, due to constraints regarding acquisition time and device configuration, intraoperative modalities have limited soft tissue image quality and reliable assessment of the cardiac anatomy typically requires contrast agent, which is harmful to the patient and requires complex acquisition protocols. We propose a probabilistic sparse matching approach to fuse high-quality preoperative CT images and nongated, noncontrast intraoperative C-arm CT images by utilizing robust machine learning and numerical optimization techniques. Thus, high-quality patient-specific models can be extracted from the preoperative CT and mapped to the intraoperative imaging environment to guide minimally invasive procedures. Extensive quantitative experiments on 95 clinical datasets demonstrate that our model-based fusion approach has an average execution time of 1.56 s, while the accuracy of 5.48 mm between the anchor anatomy in both images lies within expert user confidence intervals. In direct comparison with image-to-image registration based on an open-source state-of-the-art medical imaging library and a recently proposed quasi-global, knowledge-driven multi-modal fusion approach for thoracic-abdominal images, our model-based method exhibits superior performance in terms of registration accuracy and robustness with respect to both target anatomy and anchor anatomy alignment errors.",Anatomical overlay; computed tomography (CT); model-based cardiac image registration; procedure guidance

Among recently proposed graph matching algorithms, those utilizing the path following strategy have attracted special research attentions due to their exhibition of state-of-the-art performances. However, the paths computed in these algorithms often contain singular points, which could hurt the matching performance if not dealt properly. To deal with this issue, we propose a novel path following strategy, named branching path following (BPF), to improve graph matching accuracy. In particular, we first propose a singular point detector by solving a KKTsystem, and then design a branch switching method to seek for better paths at singular points. Moreover, to reduce the computational burden of the BPF strategy, an adaptive path estimation (APE) strategy is integrated into BPF to accelerate the convergence of searching along each path. A new graph matching algorithm named ABPF-G is developed by applying APE and BPF to a recently proposed path following algorithm named GNCCP (Liu & Qiao 2014).

Multi-exponential relaxometry is used to analyze the myelin water fraction and can help to detect related diseases. However, the underlying problem is ill-conditioned, and as such, is extremely sensitive to noise and measurement imperfections, which can lead to less precise and more biased parameter estimates.

Both selected slow developers and selected fast developers were higher in number than their counter unselected generation on scarce and abundant diets, respectively. Immature survivals of selected slow developers were depressed after the selection process while it was enhanced for selected fast developers on both diet regimes. On both diets, the total developmental duration was longer for selected slow developers and shorter for selected fast developers. Fecundity and percent egg viability were greater in selected fast developers with plentiful prey supply and lower in control slow developers with inadequate prey supply. More adult body mass was found for pre-selected slow developers than selected slow developers on a scarce diet but selected fast developers enhanced their body weight than unselected individuals of fast developers on an abundant diet.

However, state-of-the-art schedulers are hardly implementable in a real system such as long term evolution advanced (LTE-A), which imposes additional constraints on how resources are allocated. To address this problem, we first propose adaptive and generic scheduling scheme (AGSS) a generic resource allocation procedure that enables the implementation of state-of-the-art scheduling policies for building a LTE scheduler. In a second step, we propose our own scheduling policy called opportunistic PDOR aware (OPA) that both optimizes the use of the radio spectrum and provides the quality of service actually expected by applications. We show how to implement this policy using our generic scheduling scheme. We then compare the performance of AGSS to the classic scheme in a LTE environment when used with a given policy. We show that the proposed scheme outperforms the classic scheme whatever the policy. We also establish that OPA offers the best performances in terms of capacity and quality of service compared to state-of-the-art policies.",Wireless networks; LTE/LTE-A; OFDMA; Opportunistic scheduling; Quality of service

To remove these biases and compute more accurate matching results, this paper proposes a novel post-filtering method by adjusting the surface orientation of each pixel in the matching process. The core algorithm formulates the post-filtering as the optimisation of a global energy function with second-order regularisation priors. A compromise solution of the energy function is computed by breaking the optimisation into a collection of sub-optimisations of each pixel in a local adaptive window. The proposed method was compared with several state-of-the-art post-filtering methods on indoor, aerial and satellite datasets. The comparisons demonstrate that the proposed method obtains the highest post-filtering accuracies on all datasets.",dense image matching; digital surface model; fronto-parallel bias; post-filtering; surface orientation
1554,Methanol synthesis revisited: reaction mechanisms in CO/CO2 hydrogenation over Cu/ZnO and DFT analysis,"Gogate, Makarand R.","One of the very long-standing controversies in CO/CO2 hydrogenation chemistry has been the following: What is the principal source of C in the methanol product, CO or CO2? In other words, do CO hydrogenation and CO2 hydrogenation proceed independently, in parallel, over the industrial Cu/ZnO/Al2O3 catalyst? Using state of the art experimental data and our analysis of prior studies and experimental techniques including isotopic labeling studies, including radioactive tracers, FTIR, XPS, and E-TEM, we discuss the experimental findings of the prior art and analyze the experimental and theoretical first-principles calculational data, to come up with a rational and cogent explanation for all controversial areas in methanol synthesis chemistry.",carboxyl; CO hydrogenation; CO2 hydrogenation; Cu-Zn synergy; Cu; ZnO; Al2O3; DFT; elementary steps; formate; formyl; methanol synthesis; reactive intermediates; water gas shift

Study participants completed the first survey at study recruitment (mean gestational age 12.5 weeks), with 89% completing the second survey (mean gestational age 32.7 weeks) and 84% completing the third survey (6 weeks' postpartum). Multiple linear regression models compared changes by prenatal care model in pregnancy-specific distress, prenatal planning-preparation and avoidance coping, perceived stress, affect and depressive symptoms, pregnancy-related empowerment, and postpartum maternal-infant attachment and maternal functioning. Using intention-to-treat models, group prenatal care participants demonstrated a 3.2 point greater increase (p < 0.05) in their use of prenatal planning-preparation coping strategies. While group participants did not demonstrate significantly greater positive outcomes in other measures, women who were at greater psychosocial risk benefitted from participation in group prenatal care. Among women reporting inadequate social support in early pregnancy, group participants demonstrated a 2.9 point greater decrease (p = 0.03) in pregnancy-specific distress in late pregnancy and 5.6 point higher mean maternal functioning scores postpartum (p = 0.03). Among women with high pregnancy-specific distress in early pregnancy, group participants had an 8.3 point greater increase (p < 0.01) in prenatal planning-preparation coping strategies in late pregnancy and a 4.9 point greater decrease (p = 0.02) in postpartum depressive symptom scores. This study provides further evidence that group prenatal care positively impacts the psychosocial well-being of women with greater stress or lower personal coping resources. Large randomized studies are needed to establish conclusively the biological and psychosocial benefits of group prenatal care for all women.",CenteringPregnancy; Group prenatal care; Pregnancy-related distress; Prenatal care; Prenatal coping; Psychosocial outcomes.
1556,Correlated Primary Visual Texton Histogram Features for Content Base Image Retrieval,"Raza, Ahmad; Dawood, Hassan; Dawood, Hussain; Shabbir, Sidra; Mehboob, Rubab; Banjar, Ameen","In this paper, a new feature descriptor, named correlated primary visual texton histogram features (CPV-THF), for image retrieval is proposed. CPV-THF integrates the visual content and semantic information of the image by finding correlations among the colour, texture orientation, intensity, and local spatial structure information of an image. Based on texton theory, box-shaped structural elements are designed for image texture analysis. The colour, texture orientation, and intensity feature histograms that are proposed in CPV-THF are represented by correlated attributes of the co-occurrence matrix. The performance of the proposed descriptor is compared with those of state-of-the-art texture, colour, shape, and local-pattern-based CBIR descriptors. Experiments are conducted on multiple standard natural image datasets, namely, corel1k, core15k, and corel 10k. Experimental results indicate that the proposed descriptor outperforms various state-of-the-art descriptors, such as GLCM, MTH, MSD, MS-LSP, SED, STH, and MTSD.",Content-based image retrieval; correlated primary visual texton histogram; semantic-based image retrieval; texton theory-based image retrieval

Yet, instead of sucrose, total organic matter (TOM) or water-soluble carbohydrates (WSC) are typically analysed in studies that follow δ13C signals within trees. To study how the choice of organic material may bias the interpretation of δ13C records, we used mature field-grown Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) to compare for the first time δ13C of different leaf carbon pools with δ13C of assimilates estimated by a chamber-Picarro system (δ13CA_Picarro), and a photosynthetic discrimination model (δ13CA_model). Compared with sucrose, the other tested carbon pools, such as TOM and WSC, poorly recorded the seasonal trends or absolute values of δ13CA_Picarro and δ13CA_model. Consequently, in comparison with the other carbon pools, sucrose δ13C was superior for reconstructing changes in intrinsic water use efficiency (iWUE), agreeing in both absolute values and intra-seasonal variations with iWUE estimated from gas exchange. Thus, deriving iWUE and environmental signals from δ13C of bulk organic matter can lead to misinterpretation. Our findings underscore the advantage of using sucrose δ13C to understand plant physiological responses in depth.",Pinus sylvestris L; Cavity-ringdown spectrophotometer; photosynthetic carbon isotope discrimination model; starch; total organic matter (TOM); water-soluble carbohydrates (WSC).

Schwann cells, as unique glial cells in the peripheral nervous system, can be induced by interleukin-1β to secrete nerve growth factor, which promotes neural regeneration. Therefore, HHK with Schwann cells may be a more effective approach to repair nerve defects than HHK without Schwann cells. In this study, we established an artificial nerve graft by loading an HHK skeleton with activated Schwann cells. We found that the longitudinal HHK microfilament structure provided adhesion medium, space and direction for Schwann cells, and promoted Schwann cell growth and nerve fiber regeneration. In addition, interleukin-1β not only activates Schwann cells, but also strengthens their activity and increases the expression of nerve growth factors. Activated Schwann cells activate macrophages, and activated macrophages secrete interleukin-1β, which maintains the activity of Schwann cells. Thus, a beneficial cycle forms and promotes nerve repair. Furthermore, our studies have found that the newly constructed artificial nerve graft promotes the improvements in nerve conduction function and motor function in rats with sciatic nerve injury, and increases the expression of nerve injury repair factors fibroblast growth factor 2 and human transforming growth factor B receptor 2. These findings suggest that this artificial nerve graft effectively repairs peripheral nerve injury.",Schwann cells; artificial nerve graft; bioactive; human hair keratin; interleukin-1β macrophages; nerve graft; nerve growth factor; nerve repair; peripheral nervous injury.

However, existing studies focus on average effects for these relatively infrequent outcomes, thus providing no evidence for how WIC affects those at greatest risk of negative infant health outcomes. Our study focuses on documenting how WIC's infant health effects vary by level of risk. In doing so, we leverage a uniquely rich database describing maternal and infant outcomes and risk factors. Additionally, we use high dimensional data to generate predictions of risk and combine these predictions with the novel double machine learning method to stratify the effects of WIC by predicted risk. Our estimates of WIC's average treatment effects align with those in the existing literature. More importantly, we document significant variation in the effects of WIC on infant health by predicted risk level. Our results show that WIC is most beneficial among those at greatest risk of poor outcomes.",health policy; machine learning; maternal and child health; social services; treatment effect heterogeneity.

Although a plethora of psychological research has separately examined both sleep and anchoring effects on decision-making, little is known about their interaction. In the present study, we seek to shed light on the link between sleep inertia, the performance impairment immediately after awakening, and individuals' susceptibility to the anchoring bias. We proposed that sleep inertia would moderate participants' adjustment from anchors because sleep inertia leads to less cognitive effort invested, resulting in a stronger anchoring effect. One hundred four subjects were randomly assigned to an experimental group that answered anchoring tasks immediately after being awakened at nighttime or a control group that answered anchoring tasks at daytime. Our findings replicated the well-established anchoring effect in that higher anchors led participants to higher estimates than lower anchors. We did not find significant effects of sleep inertia. While the sleep inertia group reported greater sleepiness and having invested less cognitive effort compared to the control group, no systematic anchoring differences emerged, and cognitive effort did not qualify as a mediator of the anchoring effect. Bayesian analyses provide empirical evidence for these null findings. Implications for the anchoring literature and future research are discussed.",adjustment; anchoring; cognitive effort; sleep inertia; sleepiness.

Methods: Consecutive patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma who received transarterial chemoembolization plus lenvatinib and PD-1 inhibitors, lenvatinib, or sorafenib were retrospectively identified in our institution between January 2018 and August 2020. The primary endpoint was overall survival. Results: A total of 84 patients were included in this analysis. The median overall survival was significantly improved in the transarterial chemoembolization plus lenvatinib and PD-1 inhibitor group compared with the transarterial chemoembolization plus sorafenib group (26.7 months [95% confidence interval 25.2-31.6] vs 14.4 months [95% confidence interval 9.5-18.9]; hazard ratio 0.39 [95% confidence interval 0.17-0.72]; P = .007) or the transarterial chemoembolization plus lenvatinib group (26.7 months [95% confidence interval 25.2-31.6] vs 17.9 [95% confidence interval 13.4-22.2] months; hazard ratio 0.45 [95% confidence interval 0.17-0.87]; P = .031).

1562,Uncertainty Quantification for Deep Unrolling-Based Computational Imaging,"Ekmekci, Canberk; Cetin, Mujdat","Deep unrolling is an emerging deep learning-based image reconstruction methodology that bridges the gap between model-based and purely deep learning-based image reconstruction methods. Although deep unrolling methods achieve state-of-the-art performance for imaging problems and allow the incorporation of the observation model into the reconstruction process, they do not provide any uncertainty information about the reconstructed image, which severely limits their use in practice, especially for safety-critical imaging applications. In this article, we propose a learning-based image reconstruction framework that incorporates the observation model into the reconstruction task and that is capable of quantifying epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties, based on deep unrolling and Bayesian neural networks. We demonstrate the uncertainty characterization capability of the proposed framework on magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography reconstruction problems. We investigate the characteristics of the epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty information provided by the proposed framework to motivate future research on utilizing uncertainty information to develop more accurate, robust, trustworthy, uncertainty-aware, learning-based image reconstruction and analysis methods for imaging problems. We show that the proposed framework can provide uncertainty information while achieving comparable reconstruction performance to state-of-the-art deep unrolling methods.",Image reconstruction; uncertainty quantification; uncertainty characterization; deep unrolling; computational imaging; learning-based imaging

In this work, we present the design of an open-source tool which provides such a detailed profile for C/C++ applications. In contrast to prior work, our tool not only reports detailed information, but also generates this information with manageable overheads for realistic workloads. Comparison with the state-of-the-art shows that the proposed profiler has, on the average, an order of magnitude less overhead as compared to the state-of-the-art data-communication profilers for a wide range of benchmarks.

Consequently, a Chinese plant extract emodin proves to play a critical role in this investigative study since results from the Western blot and the other accompanying assays for anti-cancer effects indicate that it cannot work a lot to suppress cell migration and possible invasion, but rather emodin can be combined with radiation to give desired outcomes. Our result shows that the kind of radiation which acts well with emodin is neutron radiation rather than gamma radiation. Emodin significantly enhanced the radiosensitivity of LN18 and LN428 cells to γ-rays through MTT assay and cell counting. Accordingly, exposure to neutron radiation in the presence of emodin induced apoptotic cell death and autophagic cell death to a significantly higher extent, and suppressed cell migration and invasiveness more robustly. These effects are presumably due to the ability of emodin to amplify the effective dose from neutron radiation more efficiently. Thus, the study below is one such trial towards new interventional discovery and development in relation to glioblastoma treatment.",apoptosis; emodin; enhancement ratio; glioblastoma; neutron beam.

Starting from the fundamental assumption that similarity of context implies similarity of meaning, relevant Web documents are downloaded via a Web search engine and the contextual information of words of interest is compared (context-based similarity metrics). The proposed algorithms work automatically, do not require any human-annotated knowledge resources, e.g., ontologies, and can be generalized and applied to different languages. Context-based metrics are evaluated both on the Charles-Miller data set and on a medical term data set. It is shown that context-based similarity metrics significantly outperform co-occurrence-based metrics, in terms of correlation with human judgment, for both tasks. In addition, the proposed unsupervised context-based similarity computation algorithms are shown to be competitive with the state-of-the-art supervised semantic similarity algorithms that employ language-specific knowledge resources. Specifically, context-based metrics achieve correlation scores of up to 0.88 and 0.74 for the Charles-Miller and medical data sets, respectively. The effect of stop word filtering is also investigated for word and term similarity computation. Finally, the performance of context-based term similarity metrics is evaluated as a function of the number of Web documents used and for various feature weighting schemes.",Natural language processing; semantic similarity; Web search; ontologies; knowledge acquisition

However, existing methods based on these camera technologies suffer from several problems. Therefore, we propose a four-part method for frontal view gait recognition based on the fusion of multiple features acquired from a Time-of-Flight (ToF) camera. We have developed a gait data set captured by a ToF camera. The data set includes two sessions recorded seven months apart, with 46 and 33 subjects, respectively, each with six walks with five covariates. The four-part method includes: a new human silhouette extraction algorithm that reduces the multiple reflection problem experienced by ToF cameras; a frame selection method based on a new gait cycle detection algorithm; four new gait image representations; and a novel fusion classifier. Rigorous experiments are carried out to compare the proposed method with state-of-the-art methods. The results show distinct improvements over recognition rates for all covariates. The proposed method outperforms all major existing approaches for all covariates and results in 66.1% and 81.0% Rank 1 and Rank 5 recognition rates, respectively, in overall covariates, compared with a best state-of-the-art method performance of 35.7% and 57.7%.",Gait recognition; frontal view; Time of Flight camera; fusion of features; depth gait data set

While all the carbon-hosted single gold atoms display negligible initial activity, the in situ-evolved gold nanoparticles are highly active. Full metal-species quantification is realized by combining electron-microscopy-based atom recognition statistics and deep-learning-driven nanoparticle segmentation algorithm, allowing the structure-activity correlations for the hybrid catalysts containing different Au architectures to be established.

At high K+ levels, KdpFABC needs to be inhibited to prevent excessive K+ accumulation to the point of toxicity. This is achieved by a phosphorylation of the serine residue in the TGES162 motif in the A domain of the pump subunit KdpB (KdpBS162-P). Here, we explore the structural basis of inhibition by KdpBS162 phosphorylation by determining the conformational landscape of KdpFABC under inhibiting and non-inhibiting conditions. Under turnover conditions, we identified a new inhibited KdpFABC state that we termed E1P tight, which is not part of the canonical Post-Albers transport cycle of P-type ATPases. It likely represents the biochemically described stalled E1P state adopted by KdpFABC upon KdpBS162 phosphorylation. The E1P tight state exhibits a compact fold of the three cytoplasmic domains and is likely adopted when the transition from high-energy E1P states to E2P states is unsuccessful. This study represents a structural characterization of a biologically relevant off-cycle state in the P-type ATPase family and supports the emerging discussion of P-type ATPase regulation by such states.",E. coli; P-type ATPase; cryo-EM; membrane transport mechanism; molecular biophysics; potassium uptake; protein regulation; structural biology; structure–function.

However, when cooperation requires exertion of effort, such interventions might not always be effective. While incentives tend to be highly motivating when choosing to exert effort, evidence suggests that they have less of an effect on behavior during effort execution. The aim of this exploratory study was to incorporate these insights into empirical investigation of the effects of social incentives on cooperative effort. To this end, we modified a public goods game task to require effort contributions to a common good. Crucial manipulation involved incorporating social incentives into this task and linking them to (a) choices that people made or (b) effortful actions they exerted. Our findings suggest, in line with recent effort-based decision-making models, that social incentives have a stronger effect on cooperative effort when they are linked to choices that people make, rather than the actual effort they exert. This study demonstrates potential benefits of eliciting a priori declarations of cooperative effort tied to social incentives to encourage greater effort for the benefit of all.",choice; effort exertion; effort-based decision-making; public goods game; social incentives.

Existing studies have shown that the polar coordinate system has obvious advantages in dealing with the problem of rotating object modeling, that is, using fewer parameters to achieve more accurate rotating object detection.

In this article, we introduce the polar coordinate system to the deep learning detector for the first time, and propose an anchor free Polar Remote Sensing Object Detector (P-RSDet), which can achieve competitive detection accuracy via using simpler object representation model and less regression parameters. In P-RSDet method, arbitrary-oriented object detection can be achieved by predicting the center point and regressing one polar radius and two polar angles. Besides, in order to express the geometric constraint relationship between the polar radius and the polar angle, a Polar Ring Area Loss function is proposed to improve the prediction accuracy of the corner position.

In this study, a sparse model strain estimator (SMSE) is proposed to reconstruct a dense strain field at a high resolution, with no spatial derivatives, and a high computation efficiency. This sparse model utilizes the highly-compacted property of discrete cosine transform (DCT) coefficients, thereby allowing to parameterize displacement and strain fields with truncated DCT coefficients. The derivation of affine strain components (axial and lateral strains and shears) was reformulated into solving truncated DCT coefficients and then reconstructed with them. Moreover, an analytical solution was derived to reduce estimation time. With simulations, the SMSE reduced estimation errors by up to 50% compared with the state-of-the-art window-based Lagrangian speckle model estimator (LSME). The SMSE was also proven to be more robust than the LSME against global and local noise. For in vitro and in vivo tests, residual strains assessing cumulated errors with the SMSE were 2 to 3 times lower than with the LSME. Regarding computation efficiency, the processing time of the SMSE was reduced by 4 to 25 times compared with the LSME, according to simulations, in vitro and in vivo results. Finally, phantom studies demonstrated the enhanced spatial resolution of the proposed SMSE algorithm against LSME.",Strain; Discrete cosine transforms; Estimation; Optical flow; Microsoft Windows; Cost function; Computational modeling; Affine-based model strain; discrete cosine transform; high temporal and spatial resolutions; optical flow; sparse representation; ultrasound elastography; principal strains

Downconversion emissions in CeF3:Eu(3+)/Tb(3+) phosphors were studied with the objective of attaining a white light emitting composition, by means of a simple co-precipitation method. The material was characterized by X-ray Diffraction (XRD), Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM), Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FT-IR) and Photoluminescence (PL). Uniformly distributed nanoparticles were obtained with an average particle size range of 8-10 nm. Various studies were undertook utilizing different doping concentrations and respective fluorescence studies were carried out to optimize dopant concentrations while achieving maximum luminescence intensity. From PL results, it was observed that the efficient energy transfers from the donor to the acceptor ions. Different concentrations of Tb(3+), Eu(3+) were doped in order to achieve a white light emitting phosphor for UV-based Light Emitting Diodes (LEDs). The nanoparticles showed characteristic emission of respective dopants (Eu(3+), Tb(3+)) when excited at the 4f → 5d transition of Ce(3+).

1574,Quantum statistic based semi-supervised learning approach for industrial soft sensor development,"Zhu, Jinlin; Ge, Zhiqiang; Song, Zhihuan","Unlike process variables which can be easily measured online, quality variables are often hard to be collected. Therefore, only a small proportion of soft sensor inputs are attached with quality related output labels. The semi supervised learning mechanism can elegantly incorporate unlabeled input samples for soft sensor improvement and hence has become popular. In this work, a novel mechanism called quantum statistic is incorporated with semi-supervised learning by quantum states. The quantum states are constructed by superposing conventional pure states with composite states and the extended state space as the complements could be more desirable for representing state uncertainties of incomplete labels. Based on that, a quantum statistical based semi-supervised soft sensor is developed. The quantum statistic based model is comprehensively compared with the conventional state-of-the-art method in a numerical example and an industrial process. Results demonstrate that the proposed soft sensor is more effective and stable than the traditional state-of-art method.",Quantum statistic mechanism; Soft sensor; Semi-supervised learning; Bayesian inference

Marginal structural regression models adjusted for baseline and time-varying covariates. Of the 6897 patients enrolled and followed up for a maximum of 178 months, 44.92% received ART. Among patients who commenced receiving ART during the study, there were 98 deaths and 59 new tuberculosis diagnoses, while there were 410 deaths and 201 new tuberculosis diagnoses among those without ART. ART was associated with both lower mortality (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.18; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.11-0.27) and the presence of tuberculosis (HR = 0.27; 95% CI = 0.19-0.37). Each month of ART was associated with an average increase in CD4 cell count of 6.52 cells/mu L (95% CI = 6.08-7.12 cells/mu L). In conclusions, the effectiveness of ART provided by China government health services is the same as that in higher-income countries. Accounting to higher mortality rates from the delay of starting ART, faster expansion and timely imitation of ART are urgent.",HIV; ART; mortality; observational cohort study; China
1577,DSNet: A Dual-Stream Framework for Weakly-Supervised Gigapixel Pathology Image Analysis,"Xiang, Tiange; Song, Yang; Zhang, Chaoyi; Liu, Dongnan; Chen, Mei; Zhang, Fan; Huang, Heng; O'Donnell, Lauren; Cai, Weidong","We present a novel weakly-supervised framework for classifying whole slide images (WSIs). WSIs, due to their gigapixel resolution, are commonly processed by patch-wise classification with patch-level labels. However, patch-level labels require precise annotations, which is expensive and usually unavailable on clinical data. With image-level labels only, patch-wise classification would be sub-optimal due to inconsistency between the patch appearance and image-level label. To address this issue, we posit that WSI analysis can be effectively conducted by integrating information at both high magnification (local) and low magnification (regional) levels. We auto-encode the visual signals in each patch into a latent embedding vector representing local information, and down-sample the raw WSI to hardware-acceptable thumbnails representing regional information. The WSI label is then predicted with a Dual-Stream Network (DSNet), which takes the transformed local patch embeddings and multi-scale thumbnail images as inputs and can be trained by the image-level label only. Experiments conducted on three large-scale public datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms all recent state-of-the-art weakly-supervised WSI classification methods.",Visualization; Encoding; Annotations; Redundancy; Pathology; Metastasis; Image analysis; Weakly-supervised training; image classification; whole slide images

1579,Global Pixel Transformers for Virtual Staining of Microscopy Images,"Liu, Yi; Yuan, Hao; Wang, Zhengyang; Ji, Shuiwang","Visualizing the details of different cellular structures is of great importance to elucidate cellular functions. However, it is challenging to obtain high quality images of different structures directly due to complex cellular environments. Fluorescence staining is a popular technique to label different structures but has several drawbacks. In particular, label staining is time consuming and may affect cell morphology, and simultaneous labels are inherently limited. This raises the need of building computational models to learn relationships between unlabeled microscopy images and labeled fluorescence images, and to infer fluorescence labels of other microscopy images excluding the physical staining process. We propose to develop a novel deep model for virtual staining of unlabeled microscopy images. We first propose a novel network layer, known as the global pixel transformer layer, that fuses global information from inputs effectively. The proposed global pixel transformer layer can generate outputs with arbitrary dimensions, and can be employed for all the regular, down-sampling, and up-sampling operators. We then incorporate our proposed global pixel transformer layers and dense blocks to build an U-Net like network. We believe such a design can promote feature reusing between layers. In addition, we propose a multi-scale input strategy to encourage networks to capture features at different scales. We conduct evaluations across various fluorescence image prediction tasks to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Both quantitative and qualitative results show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art approach significantly. It is also shown that our proposed global pixel transformer layer is useful to improve the fluorescence image prediction results.",Microscopy; Task analysis; Predictive models; Convolution; Fuses; Tensors; Computational modeling; Cellular structures; microscopy images; fluorescence imaging; virtual staining; global pixel transformers; dense blocks; multi-scale inputs

The MITF and SOX10 genes play roles as master regulators of melanocyte and melanoma development. Here, we aimed to explore the complex mechanisms behind the MITF/SOX10-controlled RTK-induced drug resistance in melanoma. To achieve this, we used a number of molecular techniques, including melanoma patient data from TCGA, vemurafenib-resistant melanoma cell lines, and knock-down studies. The melanoma cell lines were classified as proliferative or invasive based upon their MITF/AXL expression activity. We measured the change of expression activity for MITF/SOX10 and their receptor (AXL/ERBB3) and ligand (NRG1/GAS6) targets known to be involved in RTK-induced drug resistance after vemurafenib treatment. We find that melanoma cell lines characterized as proliferative (high MITF low AXL), transform into an invasive (low MITF, high AXL) cell state after vemurafenib resistance, indicating novel feedback loops and advanced compensatory regulation mechanisms between the master regulators, receptors, and ligands involved in vemurafenib-induced resistance. Together, our data disclose fine-tuned mechanisms involved in RTK-facilitated vemurafenib resistance that will be challenging to overcome by using single drug targeting strategies against melanoma.",AXL; ERBB3; MITF; SOX10; resistance.
1581,Learning Structured Models for Segmentation of 2-D and 3-D Imagery,"Lucchi, Aurelien; Marquez-Neila, Pablo; Becker, Carlos; Li, Yunpeng; Smith, Kevin; Knott, Graham; Fua, Pascal","Efficient and accurate segmentation of cellular structures in microscopic data is an essential task in medical imaging. Many state-of-the-art approaches to image segmentation use structured models whose parameters must be carefully chosen for optimal performance. A popular choice is to learn them using a large-margin framework and more specifically structured support vector machines (SSVM). Although SSVMs are appealing, they suffer from certain limitations. First, they are restricted in practice to linear kernels because the more powerful nonlinear kernels cause the learning to become prohibitively expensive. Second, they require iteratively finding the most violated constraints, which is often intractable for the loopy graphical models used in image segmentation. This requires approximation that can lead to reduced quality of learning. In this paper, we propose three novel techniques to overcome these limitations. We first introduce a method to ""kernelize"" the features so that a linear SSVM framework can leverage the power of nonlinear kernels without incurring much additional computational cost. Moreover, we employ a working set of constraints to increase the reliability of approximate subgradient methods and introduce a new way to select a suitable step size at each iteration. We demonstrate the strength of our approach on both 2-D and 3-D electron microscopic (EM) image data and show consistent performance improvement over state-of-the-art approaches.",Computer vision; electron microscopy; image processing; image segmentation; kernel methods; mitochondria; segmentation; statistical machine learning; structured prediction; superpixels; supervoxels

They often function for a long number of flight hours under varying or harsh environments. Hence, prognostic and health management (PHM) of critical subsystems or components within the overall system is crucial for maintaining the safety and reliability of the aircraft. This article reviews the state of the art in aircraft failure prognostic. The main definitions and concepts are presented and discussed. In addition, a selected important failure in the representative aircraft components is outlined, and various categories of prognostic strategies are reviewed. Finally, some recommendations and directions for the most promising research to address the PHM problem in aircraft are outlined.",Aircraft; Aircraft propulsion; Prognostics and health management; Turbines; Maintenance engineering; Safety; Fault diagnosis; Aircraft system; failure prognostic; fault detection and isolation (FDI); fault diagnosis; prognostic and health management (PHM); remaining useful life (RUL)

In such settings, people living with HIV (PLHIV), and the partners of those affected may encounter specific difficulties regarding adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART), and retention in HIV prevention, treatment, and care programs. Between July 2019 and July 2021, we conducted an observational prospective cohort study of 468 PLHIV patients treated with Dolutegravir at all the ART facilities in Bunia. The probability of death being the primary outcome, as a function of time of inclusion in the cohort, was determined using Kaplan-Meier plots. We used the log-rank test to compare survival curves and Cox proportional hazard modeling to determine mortality predictors from the baseline to 31 July 2021 (endpoint). The total number of person-months (p-m) was 3435, with a death rate of 6.70 per 1000 p-m. Compared with the 35-year-old reference group, older patients had a higher mortality risk. ART-naive participants at the time of enrollment had a higher mortality risk than those already using ART. Patients with a high baseline viral load (>= 1000 copies/mL) had a higher mortality risk compared with the reference group (adjusted hazard ratio = 6.04; 95% CI: 1.78-20.43). One-fourth of deaths in the cohort were direct victims of armed conflict, with an estimated excess death of 35.6%. Improving baseline viral load monitoring, starting ART early in individuals with high baseline viral loads, the proper tailoring of ART regimens and optimizing long-term ART, and care to manage non-AIDS-related chronic complications are recommended actions to reduce mortality. Not least, fostering women's inclusion, justice, peace, and security in conflict zones is critical in preventing premature deaths in the general population as well as among PLHIV.",armed conflict; antiretroviral therapy; survival analysis; Bunia; Republic Democratic of Congo

In many cases, the creation of New Media Art requires the cooperation of artists and technologists. However, since New Media Art is an emerging art form, the process of cocreating New Media Art between the two is at the exploration stage. Especially in areas with underdeveloped New Media Art and underdeveloped technology, there exist many problems in the cooperation between the two, such as a lack of complete understanding of the factors involved in the cooperation process and a lack of reasonable planning for the cooperation process. Therefore, this study analyzes the factors that affect the collaboration process between the two creating New Media Art. Common factors are collected from the literature and then added or deleted after expert opinions. Then, analytical hierarchy process (AHP) method is applied to get the weight of each factor and understand the influence degree of the factor. The research results show that there are relatively fixed factors influencing the collaboration process between artists and technologists in creating New Media Art, and various factors have different degrees of influence on cooperation. Therefore, in the process of cooperation between the two parties, more emphasis should be placed on the factors of cooperation, which makes the cooperation more scientific.",artists; scientific and technological workers; New Media Art; cooperation process; AHP
1585,Factors in Emotion Recognition With Deep Learning Models Using Speech and Text on Multiple Corpora,"Braunschweiler, Norbert; Doddipatla, Rama; Keizer, Simon; Stoyanchev, Svetlana","Emotion recognition performance of deep learning models is influenced by multiple factors such as acoustic condition, textual content, style of emotion expression (e.g. acted, natural), etc. In this paper, multiple factors are analysed by training and evaluating state-of-the-art deep learning models using the input modalities speech, text, and their combination across 6 emotional speech corpora. A novel deep learning model architecture is presented that further improves the state-of-the-art in multimodal emotion recognition with speech and text on the IEMOCAP corpus. Results from models trained on individual corpora show that combining speech and text improves performance only on corpora where the text of utterances varies across different emotions, while it reduced performance on corpora with fixed text expressed in different emotions, where the speech-only models performed better. Further, cross-corpus investigations are presented to understand the robustness to changing acoustic and textual content. Results show that models perform significantly better in matched conditions in particular single corpus models perform better than multi-corpus models, with the latter showing a tendency to be more robust to acoustic variations, while performance still depends on characteristics of both training corpora and test corpus.",Emotion recognition; Speech recognition; Data models; Bit error rate; Deep learning; Acoustics; Training; Speech processing; natural language processing; emotion recognition; deep learning; multimodal

However, the performance may be significantly affected by the domain gap between training data (source domain) and testing data (target domain). To address this issue, we propose a data manipulation based domain generalization method, called Automated Augmentation for Domain Generalization (AADG). Our AADG framework can effectively sample data augmentation policies that generate novel domains and diversify the training set from an appropriate search space. Specifically, we introduce a novel proxy task maximizing the diversity among multiple augmented novel domains as measured by the Sinkhorn distance in a unit sphere space, making automated augmentation tractable. Adversarial training and deep reinforcement learning are employed to efficiently search the objectives. Quantitative and qualitative experiments on 11 publicly-accessible fundus image datasets (four for retinal vessel segmentation, four for optic disc and cup (OD/OC) segmentation and three for retinal lesion segmentation) are comprehensively performed. Two OCTA datasets for retinal vasculature segmentation are further involved to validate cross-modality generalization. Our proposed AADG exhibits state-of-the-art generalization performance and outperforms existing approaches by considerable margins on retinal vessel, OD/OC and lesion segmentation tasks. The learned policies are empirically validated to be model-agnostic and can transfer well to other models.

This paper presents complementary placement and routing algorithms for such capacitor arrays with the goal of nonlinearity minimization in the target SAR-ADC architecture. Starting from a state-of-the-art static nonlinearity model and its accompanying placement method, generalizations are made for both binary- and nonbinary-weighted capacitor ratios. Taking the generalized nonlinearity model and capacitor routing complexity into consideration, an improved placement method was developed, augmented with a matching-based routing technique driven by routing length adjustment. Analytical results compare the new methodology to the state-of-the-art, achieving superior resolution, linearity, and area.",Capacitors; Routing; Capacitance; Systematics; Dispersion; Linearity; Optimization; Capacitor matching; charge-redistribution; layout optimization; nonlinearity minimization; successive approximation register (SAR)-analog-to-digital converter (ADC)

However, the traditional discrete wavelet transform (DWT) is implemented with memory intensive and time-consuming algorithms and, therefore, has very high system resource requirements. In particular, the very large requirement of memory poses a serious limitation for multimedia applications on memory-constrained portable devices, such as digital cameras and sensor nodes. In this paper, we propose a novel wavelet-based image coder with low memory requirements and low complexity that preserves the compression efficiency. Our encoder employs the fractional wavelet filter (FrWF) to calculate the DWT coefficients, which are quantized and encoded with a novel low memory block tree coding (LMBTC) algorithm. The LMBTC is a listless form of the wavelet block tree coding algorithm. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed coder significantly reduces memory requirements and computational complexity and has competitive coding efficiency in comparison with other state-of-the-art coders. The FrWF combined with the LMBTC is, thus, a viable option for image communication over wireless sensor networks.",Fractional wavelet filter; low memory image codec; visual sensors; wireless sensor networks

In the literature, several articles can be found in which algorithms are presented from different perspectives for detecting emotions. More specifically, in those emotion detection systems in the literature whose computational cores are low-cost, the results presented are usually in simulation or with quite limited real tests. This article presents a facial emotion detection system-detecting emotions such as anger, happiness, sadness or surprise-that was implemented under the Robot Operating System (ROS), Noetic version, and is based on the latest machine learning (ML) techniques proposed in the state-of-the-art. To make these techniques more efficient, and that they can be executed in real time on a low-cost board, extensive experiments were conducted in a real-world environment using a low-cost general purpose board, the Raspberry Pi 4 Model B.

1590,Learning a Generative Motion Model From Image Sequences Based on a Latent Motion Matrix,"Krebs, Julian; Delingette, Herve; Ayache, Nicholas; Mansi, Tommaso","We propose to learn a probabilistic motion model from a sequence of images for spatio-temporal registration. Our model encodes motion in a low-dimensional probabilistic space - the motion matrix - which enables various motion analysis tasks such as simulation and interpolation of realistic motion patterns allowing for faster data acquisition and data augmentation. More precisely, the motion matrix allows to transport the recovered motion from one subject to another simulating for example a pathological motion in a healthy subject without the need for inter-subject registration. The method is based on a conditional latent variable model that is trained using amortized variational inference. This unsupervised generative model follows a novel multivariate Gaussian process prior and is applied within a temporal convolutional network which leads to a diffeomorphic motion model. Temporal consistency and generalizability is further improved by applying a temporal dropout training scheme. Applied to cardiac cine-MRI sequences, we show improved registration accuracy and spatio-temporally smoother deformations compared to three state-of-the-art registration algorithms. Besides, we demonstrate the model's applicability for motion analysis, simulation and super-resolution by an improved motion reconstruction from sequences with missing frames compared to linear and cubic interpolation.",Strain; Deformable models; Probabilistic logic; Tracking; Image sequences; Gaussian processes; Data models; Motion model; deformable registration; conditional variational autoencoder; Gaussian process; latent variable model; motion interpolation; motion simulation; tracking

To better understand roles for the Bergmann AMPA receptors, herein we investigate on gliotransmitter release and Ca2+ signals in isolated Bergmann glia processes obtained from adult rat cerebellum. We found that: 1) the rat cerebellar purified astrocyte processes (gliosomes) expressed astrocytic and Bergmann markers and exhibited negligible contamination by nerve terminals, microglia, or oligodendrocytes; 2) activation of Ca2+-permeable AMPA receptors caused Ca2+ signals in the processes, and the release of glutamate from the processes; 3) effectiveness of rose bengal, trypan blue or bafilomycin A1, indicated that activation of the AMPA receptors evoked vesicular glutamate release. Cerebellar purified nerve terminals appeared devoid of glutamate-releasing Ca2+-permeable AMPA receptors, indicating that neuronal contamination may not be the source of the signals detected. Ultrastructural analysis indicated the presence of vesicles in the cytoplasm of the processes; confocal imaging confirmed the presence of vesicular glutamate transporters in Bergmann glia processes. We conclude that: a vesicular mechanism for release of the gliotransmitter glutamate is present in mature Bergmann processes; entry of Ca2+ through the AMPA receptors located on Bergmann processes is coupled with vesicular glutamate release.

Several tools and platforms have been proposed to create the art devices. However, the interactive artworks are typically developed with these art devices in ad hoc approaches, and the artists need to spend significant programming efforts to integrate the art devices. This paper proposes CATtalk, a platform to create and maintain interactive artworks. The novel idea is to treat all art devices in an interactive artwork as IoT devices that can be transparently reused by reconfiguration in CATtalk. Therefore, the artworks developed independently by individual artists can be quickly integrated to create new interactive applications. Through CATtalk's no-code and low-code mechanisms, the artists can manipulate CATtalk with little or no programing efforts. CATtalk offers a built-in mechanism so that any person in the audience can play with an interactive artwork with his/her smartphone. We also conduct analytic analysis, simulation and measurements to ensure that the interactive art performance in cross-country remote stages are not affected by the communications delays. In our measurements, the average local and remote communication delays are about 0.01 and 0.05 seconds, respectively. If the art performance is designed such that the average delay between two actions of a local (remote) performer is longer than 0.1 seconds, then the probability of out-of-sequence actions is less than 0.01%. That is, the local dancer should perform slower than the remote dancer.

When there exists occlusion among the sequence, these approaches become less effective for inaccurate alignment. In this paper, we propose an effective occlusion-aware network to handle the occlusion for video deblurring. The proposed module first generates a coarse pixel-wise alignment filter to explore the temporal information and then learns an adaptive affine transformation to deal with the occluded areas. In addition, a self-attention mechanism is developed to better model the occluded pixels. To further improve the performance, we progress a multi-scale strategy and train the network in an end-to-end manner.

1597,Scalable Joint Models for Reliable Uncertainty-Aware Event Prediction,"Soleimani, Hossein; Hensman, James; Saria, Suchi","Missing data and noisy observations pose significant challenges for reliably predicting events from irregularly sampled multivariate time series (longitudinal) data. Imputation methods, which are typically used for completing the data prior to event prediction, lack a principled mechanism to account for the uncertainty due to missingness. Alternatively, state-of-the-art joint modeling techniques can be used for jointly modeling the longitudinal and event data and compute event probabilities conditioned on the longitudinal observations. These approaches, however, make strong parametric assumptions and do not easily scale to multivariate signals with many observations. Our proposed approach consists of several key innovations. First, we develop a flexible and scalable joint model based upon sparse multiple-output Gaussian processes. Unlike state-of-the-art joint models, the proposed model can explain highly challenging structure including non-Gaussian noise while scaling to large data. Second, we derive an optimal policy for predicting events using the distribution of the event occurrence estimated by the joint model. The derived policy trades-off the cost of a delayed detection versus incorrect assessments and abstains from making decisions when the estimated event probability does not satisfy the derived confidence criteria. Experiments on a large dataset show that the proposed framework significantly outperforms state-of-the-art techniques in event prediction.",Uncertainty-aware prediction; missing data; scalable Gaussian processes; survival analysis; joint modeling; time series

1599,Rock art interpretive approaches - Devising frameworks to maximally utilise independent lines of evidence,"Hardtke, Frederick E.","Past cultures in all the major continents have, for millennia, developed symbolic systems and iconographies whose depictions spanned a multiplicity of media, including rock art as well as ceramic decoration and other physical forms. This is an area which has long been recognised, but requires further investigation and research for any meaningful conclusions to be drawn - particularly regarding its potential to assist in the meaning and chronology of rock art. Taken together with other data such as the contrasting distribution of archaeological sites and rock art locations, we may form independent lines of evidence, not conclusive in their own right, but when combined can provide convincing arguments toward specific chronology and attribution. Indeed, each rock art site needs to have its own tailored interpretive framework, devised to maximally exploit the available archaeological and other data to assist in the understanding of the rock art. This paper will describe a multidimensional methodology to rock art chronological and cultural attribution using an approach applied at the site of Hierakonpolis, Upper Egypt which is known for its late Predynastic and Early Dynastic settlement and funerary localities, occurring adjacent to rock beds and hills incorporating rock art and inscriptions from a span of ages.

The AAVS1 locus includes the coding region for myosin binding subunit 85 (MBS85). Although the function of MBS85 is not well understood, myosin II-dependent contractile force may be affected by altered expression of MBS85. The effect of altered expression of MBS85 on cellular contractile force should be examined prior to the application of gene therapy. In this study, we show that transgene integration into AAVS1 and consequent reduction of MBS85 expression changes myosin II-dependent cellular contractile force. We established a human fibroblast cell line with exogenous DNA knocked-in to AAVS1 (KI cells) using the CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing system. Western blotting analysis showed that KI cells had significantly reduced MBS85 expression. KI cells also showed greater cellular contractile force than control cells. The increased contractile force was associated with phosphorylation of the myosin II regulatory light chain (MRLC). Transfection of KI cells with an MBS85 expression plasmid restored cellular contractile force and phosphorylation of MRLC to the levels in control cells. These data suggest that transgene integration into the human AAVS1 locus induces an increase in cellular contractile force and thus should be considered as a gene therapy to effect changes in cellular contractile force.",Adeno-associated virus site 1; Cellular contractile force; Genome editing; Myosin binding subunit 85; Myosin regulatory light chain phosphorylation.
1601,Two-Dimensional Tomographic Simultaneous Multispecies Visualization-Part II: Reconstruction Accuracy,"Haber, Thomas; Suntz, Rainer; Bockhorn, Henning","Recently we demonstrated the simultaneous detection of the chemiluminescence of the radicals OH* (310 nm) and CH* (430 nm), as well as the thermal radiation of soot in laminar and turbulent methane/air diffusion flames. As expected, a strong spatial and temporal coupling of OH* and CH* in laminar and moderate turbulent flames was observed. Taking advantage of this coupling, multispecies tomography enables us to quantify the reconstruction quality completely independent of any phantom studies by simply utilizing the reconstructed distribution of both species. This is especially important in turbulent flames, where it is difficult to separate measurement noise from turbulent fluctuations. It is shown that reconstruction methods based on Tikhonov regularization should be preferred over the widely used algebraic reconstruction technique (ART) and multiplicative algebraic reconstruction techniques (MART), especially for high-speed imaging or generally in the limit of low signal-to-noise ratio.",optical emission tomography; chemiluminescene; combustion; Tikhonov regularization; algebraic reconstruction technique; laminar and turbulent flows

Authorized COVID-19 vaccines based on different platforms have been widely inoculated in adults, showing up to 100% immunogenicity with significant efficacy in preventing SARS-CoV-2 infections and the occurrence of severe COVID-19. It has also greatly slowed the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 variants, as shown in clinical trials and real-world evidence. However, the total dosage of COVID-19 vaccines for children is much smaller than that for adults due to limitations from parental concern of vaccine safety, presenting a potential obstacle in ending the COVID-19 pandemic. SARS-CoV-2 not only increases the risk of severe multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS-C) in children, but also negatively affects children's psychology and academics, indirectly hindering the maintenance and progress of normal social order. Therefore, this article examines the clinical manifestations of children infected with SARS-CoV-2, the status of vaccination against COVID-19 in children, vaccination-related adverse events, and the unique immune mechanisms of children. In particular, the necessity and challenges of vaccinating children against SARS-CoV-2 were highlighted from the perspectives of society and family. In summary, parental hesitancy is unnecessary as adverse events after COVID-19 vaccination have been proven to be infrequent, comprise of mild symptoms, and have a good prognosis.",Adverse event; COVID-19; Children; MIS-C; Omicron; SARS-CoV-2; Vaccine.

Currently, water access is restricted to three of 10 persons globally. In rural areas of Mexico and other low-income countries, coverage could be even less due to the absence of formal supply; thus, rural communities usually perform water management. Surrounding community-based water management, various socio-ecological interactions emerge that determine access to water. Access to water will depend on the obstacles or capacities that arise within the socio-ecological system in which the community is immersed. This work identifies barriers and bridges to water access in a rural environment through mixed methods. The article draws on three case studies in southeastern Mexico by analyzing 90 questionnaires conducted at the household level and three focus groups in parallel with water quality analysis and its relationship with management practices. The barriers and bridges were classified into six water access challenges: (i) access to water in a sufficient quantity, (ii) access to water of adequate quality, (iii) access to water for household crop irrigation, (iv) hygiene and sanitation facilities, (v) collective organization, and (vi) climate variability. The main findings indicate that households' water quantity and quality show deficiencies due to the lack of formal infrastructure and represent a health risk. Water fetching has the highest impact on women and children in poor rural areas, and it is a significant barrier to sustainable development. In contrast, the collective organization proved to be an essential bridge for water access in these communities.",Collective organization; Community-based; Rural communities; Water management; Water quality.

Plant species (14%) and rhizosphere origin (vs bulk soil) with 13%, together explained four times more variation in cercozoan beta diversity than the three soil types (7% explained variation). Our results clearly confirm the existence of plant species-specific protist communities. Network analyses of bacteria-Cercozoa rhizosphere communities identified scale-free small world topologies, indicating mechanisms of self-organization. While the assembly of rhizosphere bacterial communities is bottom-up controlled through the resource supply from root (secondary) metabolites, our results support the hypothesis that the net effect may depend on the strength of top-down control by protist grazers. Since grazing of protists has a strong impact on the composition and functioning of bacteria communities, protists expand the repertoire of plant genes by functional traits, and should be considered as 'protist microbiomes' in analogy to 'bacterial microbiomes'.",Cercozoa; Protists; bacteria; microbiome; rhizosphere; scale-free small world networks.
1605,A new neighbourhood structure for job shop scheduling problems,"Xie, Jin; Li, Xinyu; Gao, Liang; Gui, Lin","Job shop scheduling problem (JSP) is a widely studied NP-complete combinatorial optimisation problem. Neighbourhood structures play a critical role in solving JSP. At present, there are three state-of-the-art neighbourhood structures, i.e. N5, N6, and N7. Improving the upper bounds of some famous benchmarks is inseparable from the role of these neighbourhood structures. However, these existing neighbourhood structures only consider the movement of critical operations within a critical block. According to our experiments, it is also possible to improve the makespan of a scheduling scheme by moving a critical operation outside its critical block. According to the above finding, this paper proposes a new N8 neighbourhood structure considering the movement of critical operations within a critical block and the movement of critical operations outside the critical block. Besides, a neighbourhood clipping method is designed to avoid invalid movement, discarding non-improving moves. Tabu search (TS) is a commonly used algorithm framework combined with neighbourhood structures. This paper uses this framework to compare the N8 neighbourhood structure with N5, N6, and N7 neighbourhood structures on four famous benchmarks. The experimental results verify that the N8 neighbourhood structure is more effective and efficient in solving JSP than the other state-of-the-art neighbourhood structures.",Job shop scheduling; neighbourhood structure; tabu search; critical block; critical operation

Clinical studies analysing the impact of co-infection on patient clinical outcomes lead to contradictory results. However, laboratory approaches suggest that the two pathogens co-colonize the same infection niches and form a mixed-species biofilm, therefore favouring their resistance to antibiotics and immune response. In parallel, many recent studies have focused on the different interactions between the two bacterial species. It has long been recognized that P. aeruginosa usually outcompetes S. aureus, and the molecular mechanisms involved in this state of bacterial competition are now well understood. However, several recent studies show that interactions between P. aeruginosa and S. aureus can be diverse and evolve over time. Thus, many CF isolates of P. aeruginosa and S. aureus can coexist and develop cooperative behaviours. In this chapter, we will provide an overview of the current knowledge on the mixed populations of P. aeruginosa and S. aureus, from their mechanisms of establishment to their impacts on bacterial physiology and clinical outcomes.",Bacterial interaction; Clinical outcomes; Co-infection; Coexistence; Competition; Host response; Mixed biofilm; Pseudomonas aeruginosa; Staphylococcus aureus.

The paper discusses in detail the design of such systems and their components, from the distributed amplifiers and combiners, to the broadband silicon antennas and their single-chip integration. All components are designed for fabrication in a commercially available SiGe:C BiCMOS technology. The presented results represent the state of the art in their respective areas: 170 GHz is the highest reported bandwidth for distributed amplifiers integrated in Silicon; 89 GHz is the widest reported bandwidth for integrated-system antennas; the simulated performance of the two antenna integrated receiver spans 105 GHz centered at 148GHz, which would improve the state of the art by a factor in excess of 4 even against III-V implementations, if confirmed by measurements.",mm-wave; wireless communications; BiCMOS; SiGe; SiGe:C; travelling-wave amplifier; distributed amplifier; active combiner; broadband antenna; silicon antenna
1608,Ferulic acid relieved ulcerative colitis by inhibiting the TXNIP/NLRP3 pathway in rats,"Sheng Yu,Haihua Qian,Dan Zhang,Zhenzhen Jiang,Sheng Yu,Haihua Qian,Dan Zhang,Zhenzhen Jiang","Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a disorder of the bowel that is characterized by a chronic inflammatory response. The traditional Chinese herbal medicine ferulic acid (FA) is known for its antioxidant, antiapoptotic, and antiinflammatory properties. However, its role in UC is still unclear. Thus, the current study was conducted to investigate the role of FA in UC. Rats were treated with 2,4,6-triabrobenzene sulfonic acid to induce UC and subjected to FA. Human intestinal microvascular endothelial cells (HIMECs) were treated with tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and pretreated with FA. Pathological changes in colonic tissues were visualized via hematoxylin-eosin staining. Enzyme linked immunosorbent assay was conducted to detect interleukin (IL)-6, IL-12, and IL-1β levels. Cell morphology was visualized by using a microscope, and viability was detected by using MTT. The percentage of apoptosis was detected via flow cytometry. Western blot analysis was performed to detect the expression of the apoptosis-related proteins thioredoxin-interacting protein (TXNIP) and NOD-like receptor pyrin domain-containing 3 (NLRP3). In vivo FA administration alleviated intestinal injury in UC rats and inhibited inflammatory factor levels (IL-6, IL-12, and IL-1β), apoptosis-related protein expression (caspase-1 and caspase-3) and the TXNIP/NLRP3 signaling pathway. In vitro, TNF-α treatment reduced HIMEC viability, increased cell apoptosis and inflammatory factor levels and activated the TXNIP/NLRP3 signaling pathway. However, FA treatment restored the viability of HIMECs, reduced TNF-α-induced cell apoptosis and inflammation and inhibited the TXNIP/NLRP3 signaling pathway. Furthermore, with increasing FA concentration, the effects were stronger. In summary, FA inhibits the inflammatory injury of endothelial cells in ulcerative colitis or alleviates TNF-α-induced HIMEC injury by inhibiting the TXNIP/NLRP3 signaling pathway.",NLRP3; TXNIP; ferulic acid; inflammatory; ulcerative colitis.

In an effort to understand the benefits and drawbacks of existing methods, we empirically compare five state-of-the-art superpixel algorithms for their ability to adhere to image boundaries, speed, memory efficiency, and their impact on segmentation performance. We then introduce a new superpixel algorithm, simple linear iterative clustering (SLIC), which adapts a k-means clustering approach to efficiently generate superpixels. Despite its simplicity, SLIC adheres to boundaries as well as or better than previous methods. At the same time, it is faster and more memory efficient, improves segmentation performance, and is straightforward to extend to supervoxel generation.",Superpixels; segmentation; clustering; k-means

1611,A Low Complexity Design Framework for NFC-RFID Inductive Coupled Antennas,"Couraud, Benoit; Deleruyelle, Thibaut; Vauche, Remy; Flynn, David; Daskalakis, Spyridon Nektarios","Inductive Wireless Power and Data Transfer (WPDT) technology has become a vital enabler to the globalisation of Internet of Things. Driven by an increasing demand for data within applications and by the need to reduce the devices footprint by transmitting data and power with the same antenna, power transfer efficiency has become a barrier to WPDT systems' performance. To overcome the limitations of power transfer efficiency, current research focuses on the design of efficient integrated circuits and does not consider the challenges of inductive antennas' design and system integration. Hence, current system integration methods used in industry to design receivers for WPDT applications still require expensive experimental benchmarking of antennas. This paper introduces a new framework for inductive WPDT systems integration that focuses on the design of inductive coils and tuning capacitances. First, this framework proposes a new planar rectangular coil inductance formula that achieves an average error of 11% based on the testing of one hundred of coils, which out performs the current state of the art. Then, based on a detailed electrical model of both transmitter and receiver of WPDT systems, our design framework computes the coils geometric parameters and tuning capacitances that will optimize the overall efficiency of the WPDT system. Unlike state of the art design approaches, the main advantage of this framework is that it does not require expensive benchmarking of inductive antennas to find the optimal antenna. Verification of our design framework was achieved through a comparative analysis for Very High Bit Rate 13.56 MHz RFID applications. Results indicate an improvement of more than 15% in overall system power transfer efficiency compared to current state of the art methods within a comparatively more cost effective framework.

1613,Paperfetcher: A tool to automate handsearching and citation searching for systematic reviews,"Akash Pallath,Qiyang Zhang,Akash Pallath,Qiyang Zhang","Systematic reviews are vital instruments for researchers to understand broad trends in a field and synthesize evidence on the effectiveness of interventions in addressing specific issues. The quality of a systematic review depends critically on having comprehensively surveyed all relevant literature on the review topic. In addition to database searching, handsearching is an important supplementary technique that helps increase the likelihood of identifying all relevant studies in a literature search. Traditional handsearching requires reviewers to manually browse through a curated list of field-specific journals and conference proceedings to find articles relevant to the review topic. This manual process is not only time-consuming, laborious, costly, and error-prone due to human fatigue, but it also lacks replicability due to its cumbersome manual nature. To address these issues, this paper presents a free and open-source Python package and an accompanying web-app, Paperfetcher, to automate the retrieval of article metadata for handsearching. With Paperfetcher's assistance, researchers can retrieve article metadata from designated journals within a specified time frame in just a few clicks. In addition to handsearching, it also incorporates a beta version of citation searching in both forward and backward directions. Paperfetcher has an easy-to-use interface, which allows researchers to download the metadata of retrieved studies as a list of DOIs or as an RIS file to facilitate seamless import into systematic review screening software. To the best of our knowledge, Paperfetcher is the first tool to automate handsearching with high usability and a multi-disciplinary focus.",citation searching; handsearching; information retrieval; literature search; supplementary techniques; systematic reviews.

Consequently they strongly influence the efficiency of the entire wastewater treatment plant. However, in the last decades the inner physical processes of PSTs, largely determining their efficiency, have been poorly addressed. In common practice PSTs are still solely designed and operated based on the surface overflow rate and the hydraulic retention time (HRT) as a black box. The paper shows the results of a comprehensive investigation programme, including 16 PSTs. Their removal efficiency and inner physical processes (like the settling process of primary sludge), internal flow structures within PSTs and their impact on performance were investigated. The results show that: (1) the removal rates of PSTs are generally often underestimated in current design guidelines, (2) the removal rate of different PSTs shows a strongly fluctuating pattern even in the same range of the HRT, and (3) inlet design of PSTs becomes highly relevant in the removal efficiency at rather high surface overflow rates, above 5 m/h, which is the upper design limit of PSTs for dry weather load.",biodegradable carbon; computational fluid dynamics; DWA; primary settling tanks; suspended solids; wastewater treatment

Here, an innovative α-MnO2/ZSM-5 catalyst modified with SO42- was successfully prepared, and both characterizations and density functional theory (DFT) calculations showed that SO42- introduction facilitated the formation of oxygen vacancies, Lewis and Brönsted acid sites, and active oxygen species and enhanced the adsorption ability of toluene on α-MnO2/ZSM-5. Characterizations also showed that SO42- introduction made the catalyst possess larger specific surface area, superior reducibility, and stronger surface acidity. As a result, α-MnO2/ZSM-5 with a S/Mn molar ratio of 0.019 exhibited the best toluene conversion and COx selectivity, 87 and 94%, respectively, after the reaction for 8 h at 30 °C under an initial concentration of 5 ppm toluene and 45 ppm ozone, relative humidity of 45%, and space velocity of 32,000 h-1, far superior to those of non-noble catalysts reported to date under comparable reaction conditions. The synergistic role of increased oxygen vacancies and acid sites of α-MnO2/ZSM-5 modified with SO42- resulted in excellent toluene conversion and COx selectivity.

However, methods for multi-guidewire endpoint localization in fluoroscopy images are still scarce. In this paper, we introduce a framework for real-time multi-guidewire endpoint localization in fluoroscopy images. The framework consists of two stages, first detecting all guidewire instances in the fluoroscopy image, and then locating the endpoints of each single guidewire instance. In the first stage, a YOLOv3 detector is used for guidewire detection, and a post-processing algorithm is proposed to refine the guidewire detection results. In the second stage, a Segmentation Attention-hourglass (SA-hourglass) network is proposed to predict the endpoint locations of each single guidewire instance. The SA-hourglass network can be generalized to the keypoint localization of other surgical instruments. In our experiments, the SA-hourglass network is applied not only on a guidewire dataset but also on a retinal microsurgery dataset, reaching the mean pixel error (MPE) of 2.20 pixels on the guidewire dataset and the MPE of 5.30 pixels on the retinal microsurgery dataset, both achieving the state-of-the-art localization results. Besides, the inference rate of our framework is at least 20FPS, which meets the real-time requirement of fluoroscopy images (6-12FPS).",Location awareness; Surgery; Instruments; Task analysis; Detectors; Real-time systems; Retina; Guidewire endpoint; keypoint localization; surgical instrument

The resultant PdS@UiOS@CZS with an optimal ratio between components displays an excellent photocatalytic H2 evolution rate of 46.1 mmol h-1 g-1 under visible light irradiation (420∼780 nm), which is 512.0, 9.2, and 5.9 times that of pure UiOS, CZS, and UiOS@CZS, respectively. The reason for the significantly enhanced performance is that the encapsulated PdS QDs strongly attract the photogenerated holes into the pores of UiOS, while the photogenerated electrons are effectively migrated to CZS due to the heterojunction effect, thereby effectively suppressing the recombination of charge carriers for further high-efficiency hydrogen production. This work provides an idea for developing efficient photocatalysts induced by hole attraction.",co-catalyst; heterojunction; hydrogen evolution; metal−organic framework; photocatalysis; quantum dot.

Although various methods have been developed, it is still difficult for the state-of-the-art algorithms to obtain high recognition precision with low computational costs. In this paper, based on the investigation on the influence that color spaces have on the representation learning of convolutional neural network, a novel traffic sign recognition approach called DP-KELM is proposed by using a kernel-based extreme learning machine (KELM) classifier with deep perceptual features. Unlike the previous approaches, the representation learning process in DP-KELM is implemented in the perceptual Lab color space. Based on the learned deep perceptual feature, a kernel-based ELM classifier is trained with high computational efficiency and generalization performance. Through the experiments on the German traffic sign recognition benchmark, the proposed method is demonstrated to have higher precision than most of the state-of-the-art approaches. In particular, when compared with the hinge loss stochastic gradient descent method which has the highest precision, the proposed method can achieve a comparable recognition rate with significantly fewer computational costs.",Traffic sign recognition; convolutional neural network; extreme learning machine; kernel; color space; lab

To understand the evolution of maternal-fetal communication, we used ligand-receptor gene expression as a proxy for the potential for cross-talk in a live-bearing lizard (Pseudemoia entrecasteauxii) and homologous tissues in a related egg-laying lizard (Lampropholis guichenoti). Approximately 70% of expressed ligand/receptor genes were shared by both species. Gene ontology (GO) analysis showed that there was no GO-enrichment in the fetal membranes of the egg-laying species, but live-bearing fetal tissues were significantly enriched for 50 GO-terms. Differences in enrichment suggest that the evolution of viviparity involved reinforcing specific signalling pathways, perhaps to support fetal control of placentation. One identified change was in transforming growth factor beta signalling. Using immunohistochemistry, we show the production of the signalling molecule inhibin beta B (INHBB) occurs in viviparous fetal membranes but was absent in closely related egg-laying tissues, suggesting that the evolution of viviparity may have involved changes to signalling via this pathway. We argue that maternal-fetal signalling evolved through co-opting expressed signalling molecules and recruiting new signalling molecules to support the complex developmental changes required to support a fetus in utero.

The model is robust to missing data, as it benefits from, but does not require, additional input modalities. The model is trained end-to-end, and learns to embed all input modalities into a shared modality-invariant latent space. These latent representations are then combined into a single fused representation, which is transformed into the target output modality with a learnt decoder. We avoid the need for curriculum learning by exploiting the fact that the various input modalities are highly correlated. We also show that by incorporating information from segmentation masks the model can both decrease its error and generate data with synthetic lesions. We evaluate our model on the ISLES and BRATS data sets and demonstrate statistically significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods for single input tasks. This improvement increases further when multiple input modalities are used, demonstrating the benefits of learning a common latent space, again resulting in a statistically significant improvement over the current best method. Finally, we demonstrate our approach on non skull-stripped brain images, producing a statistically significant improvement over the previous best method.

However, finding optimal thread assignments for workloads running in state-of-the-art multicore/multithreaded processors is an NP-complete problem. In this paper, we propose BlackBox scheduler, a systematic method for thread assignment of multithreaded network applications running on multicore/multithreaded processors. The method requires minimum information about the target processor architecture and no data about the hardware requirements of the applications under study. The proposed method is evaluated with an industrial case study for a set of multithreaded network applications running on the UltraSPARC T2 processor. In most of the experiments, the proposed thread assignment method detected the best actual thread assignment in the evaluation sample. The method improved the system performance from 5 to 48 percent with respect to load balancing algorithms used in state-of-the-art OSs, and up to 60 percent with respect to a naive thread assignment.",Chip multithreading (CMT); process scheduling; performance modeling
1622,Fun with food - A parent-child community cooking intervention reduces parental fear and increases children's perceived competence,"Fiona Lavelle,Elaine Mooney,Sonya Coffey,Roisin Lydon,Moira Dean,Amanda McCloat,Fiona Lavelle,Elaine Mooney,Sonya Coffey,Roisin Lydon,Moira Dean,Amanda McCloat","Cooking is being promoted as a preventative strategy for numerous health outcomes. However, there has been a reported decline in opportunities for children to learn in the home environment due to parental barriers such as time and concerns around children conducting certain skills. Therefore, this study aimed to understand the impact of a parent-child community cooking intervention on children's perceived cooking competence and interest in cooking and parental perceptions around including children in cooking. 'Fun with Food' was a four-week parent-child cooking intervention based on Experiential Learning Theory and designed by Home Economists. A mixed-method approach was undertaken to understand the effectiveness of the community-based intervention. Parents completed pre and post focus group discussions that were analyzed using Thematic Analysis. Pre and post surveys were used to investigate children's perceived cooking competence and analyzed with paired-samples t-tests and Cohen's d. Children's perceived cooking competence significantly increased after the intervention (P < 0.001, effect size -0.92). Parental fears around children performing certain skills, such as chopping and cutting, were reduced. Additionally, both children and parents found it an enjoyable experience, and appreciated the time spent together, which may be an indicator for positive wellbeing. Parents reported that children have been more actively involved in cooking since the intervention. Further, parents felt strongly that children should be cooking from as young as possible and that Home Economics should be introduced in primary school and made compulsory for older students in secondary school. The parent-child format for cooking has shown to be effective for increasing children's perceived cooking competence and reducing parental fears, highlighting it as a promising method for future interventions.",Children; Cooking; Home economics; Intervention; Parent; Perceived competence.
1623,Nonlinear Energy-Maximizing Optimal Control of Wave Energy Systems: A Moment-Based Approach,"Faedo, Nicolas; Scarciotti, Giordano; Astolfi, Alessandro; Ringwood, John V.","Linear dynamics are virtually always assumed when designing optimal controllers for wave energy converters (WECs), motivated by both their simplicity and computational convenience. Nevertheless, unlike traditional tracking control applications, the assumptions under which the linearization of WEC models is performed are challenged by the energy-maximizing controller itself, which intrinsically enhances device motion to maximize power extraction from incoming ocean waves. In this article, we present a moment-based energy-maximizing control strategy for WECs subject to nonlinear dynamics. We develop a framework under which the objective function (and system variables) can be mapped to a finite-dimensional tractable nonlinear program, which can be efficiently solved using state-of-the-art nonlinear programming solvers. Moreover, we show that the objective function belongs to a class of generalized convex functions when mapped to the moment domain, guaranteeing the existence of a global energy-maximizing solution and giving explicit conditions for when a local solution is, effectively, a global maximizer. The performance of the strategy is demonstrated through a case study, where we consider (state and input-constrained) energy maximization for a state-of-the-art CorPower-like WEC, subject to different hydrodynamic nonlinearities.",Optimal control; Hydrodynamics; Nonlinear dynamical systems; Linear programming; Computational modeling; Mathematical model; Tracking; Energy maximization; moment; moment matching; nonlinear optimal control; wave energy
1624,Feature-Preserving Noise Removal,"Youssef, Khalid; Jarenwattananon, Nanette N.; Bouchard, Louis-S.","Conventional image restoration algorithms use transform-domain filters, which separate the noise from the sparse signal among the transform components or apply spatial smoothing filters in real space whose design relies on prior assumptions about the noise statistics. These filters also reduce the information content of the image by suppressing spatial frequencies or by recognizing only a limited set of shapes. Here we show that denoising can be efficiently done using a nonlinear filter, which operates along patch neighborhoods and multiple copies of the original image. The use of patches enables the algorithm to account for spatial correlations in the random field whereas the multiple copies are used to recognize the noise statistics. The nonlinear filter, which is implemented by a hierarchical multistage system of multilayer perceptrons, outperforms state-of-the-art denoising algorithms such as those based on collaborative filtering and total variation. Compared to conventional denoising algorithms, our filter can restore images without blurring them, making it attractive for use in medical imaging where the preservation of anatomical details is critical.",Multilayer perceptrons; image restoration; image denoising; magnetic resonance imaging; multiple copies

We examine the calibration problem from two alternative geometrical interpretations, called hand-eye' and robot-world-hand-eye', respectively. The study analyses the effects of specifying the objective function as pose error or reprojection error minimization problem. We provide three real and three simulated datasets with rendered images as part of the study. In addition, we propose a robotic arm error modeling approach to be used along with the simulated datasets for generating a realistic response. The tests on simulated data are performed in both ideal cases and with pseudo-realistic robotic arm pose and visual noise.

However, the low response rate to immunotherapy suggests a low number of antigen-specific T cells and a high number of immunosuppressive tumor-associated macrophages in the pancreatic tumor microenvironment. Herein, we developed an in situ injectable thermosensitive chitosan hydrogel loaded with lipid-immune regulatory factor 5 (IRF5) mRNA/C-C chemokine ligand 5 (CCL5) siRNA (LPR) nanoparticle complexes (LPR@CHG) that reprogram the antitumoral immune niche. The LPR@CHG hydrogel upregulates IRF5 and downregulates CCL5 secretion, which contribute to a significant increase in M1 phenotype macrophages. Tumor growth is controlled by effective M1 phenotype macrophage that initiate T cell-mediated immune responses. Overall, the LPR@CHG hydrogel is expected to be a meaningful immunotherapy platform that can reshape the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment and improve the efficacy of current pancreatic immunotherapies while minimizing systemic toxicity.",RNA delivery; TAMs; chitosan hydrogel; immune therapy; liposome nanoparticles.
1627,Investigating the effects of demand flexibility on electricity retailers' business through a tri-level optimisation model,"Qiu, Dawei; Papadaskalopoulos, Dimitrios; Ye, Yujian; Strbac, Goran","The investigation of the effects of demand flexibility on the pricing strategies and the profits of electricity retailers has recently emerged as a highly interesting research area. However, the state-of-the-art, bi-level optimisation modelling approach makes the unrealistic assumption that retailers treat wholesale market prices as exogenous, fixed parameters. This study proposes a tri-level optimisation model, which drops this assumption and represents the wholesale market clearing process endogenously, thus capturing the realistic implications of a retailer's pricing strategies and the resulting demand response on the wholesale market prices. The scope of the examined case studies is three-fold. First of all, they demonstrate the interactions between the retailer, the flexible consumers and the wholesale market and analyse the fundamental effects of the consumers' time-shifting flexibility on the retailer's revenue from the consumers, its cost in the wholesale market and its overall profit. Furthermore, they analyse how these effects of demand flexibility depend on the retailer's relative size in the market and the strictness of the regulatory framework. Finally, they highlight the added value of the proposed tri-level model by comparing its outcomes against the state-of-the-art bi-level modelling approach.",optimisation; power markets; pricing; retailing; demand side management; demand flexibility; electricity retailers; tri-level optimisation model; pricing strategies; bi-level optimisation modelling approach; unrealistic assumption; wholesale market prices; wholesale market clearing process; demand response; flexible consumers; fundamental effects; profit; tri-level model; state-of-the-art bi-level modelling approach

Such replacement must be deemed sustainable from agronomic and greenhouse gas (GHG) emission perspectives. For agronomic performance several controlled protocols are in place but not for testing GHG emissions. Herein, a pre-screening tool is presented to examine GHG emissions from bio-waste as fertilizers. The various treatments examined are as follows: soil with added mineral nitrogen (N, 140 kg N ha-1) fertilizer (MF), the same amount of MF combined with dairy processing sludge (DS), sludge-derived biochar produced at 450 °C (BC450) and 700 °C (BC700) and untreated control (CK). These treatments were combined with Danish (sandy loam) or Irish (clay loam) soils, with carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions and soil inorganic-N contents measured on selected days. During the incubation, biochar mitigated N2O emissions by regulating denitrification. BC450 reduced N2O emissions from Danish soil by 95.5% and BC700 by 97.7% compared to emissions with the sludge application, and for Irish soil, the N2O reductions were 93.6% and 32.3%, respectively. For both soils, biochar reduced CO2 emissions by 50% as compared to the sludge. The lower N2O reduction potential of BC700 for Irish soil could be due to the high soil organic carbon and clay content and pyrolysis temperature. For the same reasons emissions of N2O and CO2 from Irish soil were significantly higher than from Danish soil. The temporal variation in N2O emissions was correlated with soil inorganic-N contents. The CH4 emissions across treatments were not significantly different. This study developed a simple and cost-effective pre-screening method to evaluate the GHG emission potential of new bio-waste before its field application and guide the development of national emission inventories, towards achieving the goals of circular economy and the European Green Deal.",Bio-waste; Dairy; Greenhouse gas emissions; Pyrolysis temperature; Sludge; Soil characteristics.

In this report, mimicking the induction responses in tomato seedlings achieved by HRW or exogenous hydrogen peroxide (H2O2; a positive control), transgenic Arabidopsis that overexpressed the hydrogenase1 gene (CrHYD1) from Chlamydomonas reinhardtii not only stimulated endogenous hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) production, but also markedly promoted LR formation. Above H2 and H2O2 responses were abolished by the removal of endogenous H2O2. Moreover, the changes in transcriptional patterns of representative cell cycle genes and auxin signaling-related genes during LR development in both tomato and transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana matched with above phenotypes. The alternations in the levels of GUS transcripts driven by the CYCB1 promoter and expression of PIN1 protein further indicated that H2O2 synthesis was tightly linked to LR formation achieved by endogenous H2, and cell cycle regulation and auxin-dependent pathway might be their targets. There results might provide a reference for molecular mechanism underlying the regulation of root morphogenesis by H2.",Arabidopsis; Hydrogen gas; Hydrogen peroxide; Lateral root; Tomato.

Due to complex structures, pathological changes, individual differences, and low image quality, accurate lung segmentation in clinical 3-D computed tomography (CT) images is still a challenging task. To overcome these problems, a novel dictionary-based approach is introduced to automatically segment pathological lungs in 3-D low-dose CT images. Sparse shape composition is integrated with the eigenvector space shape prior model, called eigenspace sparse shape composition, to reduce local shape reconstruction error caused by the weak and misleading appearance prior information. To initialize the shape model, a landmark recognition method based on discriminative appearance dictionary is introduced to handle lesions and local details. Furthermore, a new vertex search strategy based on the gradient vector flowfield is also proposed to drive the shape deformation to the target boundary. The proposed algorithm is tested on 78 3-D low-dose CT images with lung tumors. Compared to the state-of-the-art methods, the proposed approach can robustly and accurately detect pathological lung surface.",Pathological lung segmentation; eigenspace sparse shape composition; gradient vector flow; discriminative appearance dictionary

This subclass encompasses almost all prominent simulation techniques. We prove an unconditional (i.e. without relying on any complexity-theoretic assumptions) and explicit (n - 2)(2(n-3) - 1) lower bound on the running time of simulators within this subclass. Assuming the Strong Exponential Time Hypothesis (SETH), we further remark that a universal simulator computing any amplitude to precision 2(-n) /2 must take at least 2(n-o(n)) time. We then compare strong simulators to existing SAT solvers, and identify the time-complexity below which a strong simulator would improve on state-of-the-art general SAT solving. Finally, we investigate Clifford+T quantum circuits with t T-gates. Using the sparsification lemma, we identify a time complexity lower bound of 2(2.2451x10-8)t below which a strong simulator would improve on state-of-the-art 3-SAT solving. This also yields a conditional exponential lower bound on the growth of the stabilizer rank of magic states.",Quantum computing; computational complexity; circuit simulation

First, motivated by the relationship between the linear approximation of a nonlinear function in high dimensional space and the state-of-the-art feature representation used in image retrieval, i.e., VLAD, we propose a new approach for the approximation. The embedded vectors resulted by the function approximation process are then aggregated to form a single representation for image retrieval. Second, in order to make the proposed embedding method applicable to large scale problem, we further derive its fast version in which the embedded vectors can be efficiently computed, i.e., in the closed-form. We compare the proposed embedding methods with the state of the art in the context of image search under various settings: when the images are represented by medium length vectors, short vectors, or binary vectors. The experimental results show that the proposed embedding methods outperform existing the state of the art on the standard public image retrieval benchmarks.",Image search; function approximation; feature embedding

During the past, sufficient works have been proposed to address this problem. Though great improvements these methods have achieved, no derain network can confidently declare that it can solve rain removal problem perfectly. Single complex model may lead to overfitting, while simple model is too weak to achieve clear result. Therefore, in this paper, inspired from classic boosting idea, we have proposed an effective ensemble derain framework to aggregate multiple simple weak drain models to obtain a strong derain model. Cascade structural weighting map are computed for adaptively emphasizing the quality of local derain regions. Struct-absolution losses are proposed to account for pixel-wise and local region-wise differences, and to facilitate embedding boosting idea into network training. The comprehensive experiments on public derain datasets and high-level vision tasks validate that our proposed model which just utilizes three generally weak derain subnets can achieve much better performance than compared state-of-the-art methods.

Our binary descriptor encodes the motion information of a spatio-temporal support region into a low-dimensional binary string. The descriptor is based on a binning strategy and a construction that binarizes separately the horizontal and vertical motion components of the spatio-temporal support region. We pair our descriptor with a novel Fisher Vector (FV) scheme for binary data to project a set of binary features into a fixed length vector in order to evaluate the similarity between feature sets. We test the effectiveness of our binary feature descriptor with FVs for action recognition, which is one of the most challenging tasks in computer vision, as well as gait recognition and animal behavior clustering. Several experiments on the KTH, UCF50, UCF101, CASIA-B, and TIGdog datasets show that the proposed binary feature descriptor outperforms the state-of-the-art feature descriptors in terms of computational time and memory and storage requirements. When paired with FVs, the proposed feature descriptor attains a very competitive performance, outperforming several state-of-the-art feature descriptors and some methods based on convolutional neural networks.",Binary features; video analysis; fisher vectors; CNN

Onto semi-interpenetrating polymer network-structured, thiol-modified transparent nanocellulose paper, a thin layer of silver nanowire and a conducting polymer (chosen as a pseudocapacitive electrode material) are consecutively introduced through microscale-patterned masks (which are fabricated by electrohydrodynamic jet printing) to produce a transparent conductive electrode (TNP-TCE) with planar interdigitated structure. This TNP-TCE, in combination with solid-state gel electrolytes, enables on-demand (in-series/in-parallel) cell configurations in a single body of TNP-MSC. Driven by this structural uniqueness and scalable microfabrication, the TNP-MSC exhibits improvements in optical transparency (T = 85%), areal capacitance (0.24 mF cm-2 ), controllable voltage (7.2 V per cell), and mechanical flexibility (origami airplane), which exceed those of previously reported transparent MSCs based on synthetic chemicals.",biopolymer; foldable electronics; nanocellulose; supercapacitors; transparent power source.

We first derive the exact forward wave model of MIMO-CSAR and then propose a range migration algorithm for near-range high-precision 3-D image reconstruction. Our formulation is strictly based on wave theory. The propagation attenuation, which is an inherent factor in wave equation and is significant for near-range wide-angle sensing case, is considered and compensated efficiently with a Fourier-domain matched filtering. Besides, the phase decoupling is achieved with a 2-D Stolt mapping. The computational complexity of the algorithm is at the same level as the state-of-the-art method. Compared with the state of the art, by considering the amplitude variation, the imaging quality can be improved for near-range measurement with large beamwidth. The results from both synthetic and practical measurement data demonstrate that a wider dynamic range (less sidelobes appeared at the same dynamic level) and a better recovery for widespread targets compared with the state-of-the-art imaging method.",Circular synthetic aperture radar (CSAR); millimeter-wave (MMW) imaging; multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO); 3-D holographic reconstruction

The prevention of vapor film formation is a fundamental challenge for the enhancement of boiling systems, and an impetus therefore exists for the discovery of new techniques to segregate nucleating bubbles during their formation. Herein, we utilize the strong capillary forces generated by nanostructures to pin the liquid/vapor interface in three dimensions and thereby control the coalescence and flow interactions of developing bubbles. We demonstrate this principle on both symmetrical and asymmetrical superbiphilic microstructures, showing enhancement of peak heat transfer coefficient by 81% and 113%, respectively, when compared to the best superhydrophilic and superhydrophobic analogues.

Therefore, accurate segmentation of drusen in retinal OCT images is crucial for early diagnosis of AMD. However, drusen segmentation in retinal OCT images is still very challenging due to the large variations in size and shape of drusen, blurred boundaries, and speckle noise interference. Moreover, the lack of OCT dataset with pixel-level annotation is also a vital factor hindering the improvement of drusen segmentation accuracy. To solve these problems, a novel multi-scale transformer global attention network (MsTGANet) is proposed for drusen segmentation in retinal OCT images. In MsTGANet, which is based on U-Shape architecture, a novel multi-scale transformer non-local (MsTNL) module is designed and inserted into the top of encoder path, aiming at capturing multi-scale non-local features with long-range dependencies from different layers of encoder. Meanwhile, a novel multi-semantic global channel and spatial joint attention module (MsGCS) between encoder and decoder is proposed to guide the model to fuse different semantic features, thereby improving the model's ability to learn multi-semantic global contextual information. Furthermore, to alleviate the shortage of labeled data, we propose a novel semi-supervised version of MsTGANet (Semi-MsTGANet) based on pseudo-labeled data augmentation strategy, which can leverage a large amount of unlabeled data to further improve the segmentation performance. Finally, comprehensive experiments are conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed MsTGANet and Semi-MsTGANet.

Taking into account importance of the gut-brain communication system, SP properties were compared regarding their capability to modulate functioning of nerve terminals and gut cells/preparations. In cortex nerve terminals, poplar wood SP was more effective in decreasing uptake and increasing the extracellular levels of excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters L-[14C]glutamate and [3H]GABA, respectively. Spontaneous and H2O2-stimulated ROS generation in nerve terminals decreased by SPs, the most efficient one was from poplar wood. SPs from birch, pine and poplar wood caused membrane depolarization, poplar wood SP effect was 5-fold higher vs. birch and pine wood ones. Functional characteristics of gut cells/preparations, which tightly related to nerve terminal experiments, were assessed. SPs increased paracellular permeability of proximal colon mucosal-submucosal preparations monitored in Ussing chamber system (FITC-dextran, 4 kDa), where the most prominent effect had poplar wood SP. The latter demonstrated more considerable influence on COLO 205 cell causing 30 % loss of cell viability.

1642,Ten years of art imaging research,"Martinez, K; Cupitt, J; Saunders, D; Pillay, R","This paper describes a decade of work on digital imaging for museums. From 1989 to 1992, the visual arts system for archiving and retrieval of images (VASARI) project produced a digital-imaging system that made color-calibrated images of up to 20000 x 20000 pixels directly from paintings. It used seven color-separation bands in the visible region, resulting in an average color error of around I DeltaE(ab)* unit. These images have since been used to monitor the condition of paintings, document paintings during conservation treatment, including predicting appearance after cleaning, reconstruct the original appearance of paintings in which pigments have faded, and assess whether paintings have been damaged during transportation, in estimations of the surface reflectance spectra and in the printing of high-quality reproductions. We have applied similar techniques to museum infrared and X-ray imaging. To manage the images produced by the VASARI system, an image-processing package has been developed that is tailored for very large colorimetric images. This package has since been used in several other projects. including a remote image viewer designed to provide internet access to high-resolution images. The paper explores these developments and gives details of the current generation of VASARI-derived systems. set in the context of the state of the art for museum imaging.",colorimetry; image processing; imaging; museum; painting

However, the molecular cloning and expression of sox1 gene in marine fish have not been reported yet. In this study, we first cloned and characterized the full-length cDNAs and the partial 5'-flanking regions of Paralichthys olivaceus sox1a (Posox1a) and sox1b (Posox1b). Phylogenetic, gene structure, and chromosome synteny analyses revealed that Posox1a and Posox1b were co-orthologs and homologous to mammalian Sox1. The promoter regions of Posox1a and Posox1b were also analyzed and several potential transcription factor (TF) binding sites were identified which might modulate gene expression. Quantitative real-time RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) results showed that Posox1a and Posox1b were consistently expressed during embryogenesis, with the highest level at the neurula stage. Tissue distribution analyses revealed that Posox1a and Posox1b were abundant in the adult brain. Moreover, Posox1a had a faster evolution rate and much higher expression levels than Posox1b.

B.; Altabey, Wael A.","The main drawback of energy harvesting using the piezoelectric direct effect is that the maximum electric power is generated at the fundamental resonance frequency. This can clearly be observed in the size and dimensions of the components of any particular energy harvester. In this paper, we are investigating a new proposed energy harvesting device that employs the Automatic Resonance Tuning (ART) technique to enhance the energy harvesting mechanism. The proposed harvester is composed of a cantilever beam and sliding masse with varying locations. ART automatically adjusts the energy harvester's natural frequency according to the ambient vibration natural frequency. The ART energy harvester modifies the natural frequency of the harvester using the motion of the mobile (sliding) mass. An analytical model of the proposed model is presented. The investigation is conducted using the Finite Element Method (FEM). THE FEM COMSOL model is successfully validated using previously published experimental results. The results of the FEM were compared with the experimental and analytical results. The validated model is then used to demonstrate the displacement profile, the output voltage response, and the natural frequency for the harvester at different mass positions. The bandwidth of the ART harvester (17 Hz) is found to be 1130% larger compared to the fixed resonance energy harvester.

1645,Learning and generalising object extraction skill for contact-rich disassembly tasks: an introductory study,"Serrano-Munoz, Antonio; Arana-Arexolaleiba, Nestor; Chrysostomou, Dimitrios; Bogh, Simon","Remanufacturing automation must be designed to be flexible and robust enough to overcome the uncertainties, conditions of the products, and complexities in the planning and operation of the processes. Machine learning methods, in particular reinforcement learning, are presented as techniques to learn, improve, and generalise the automation of many robotic manipulation tasks (most of them related to grasping, picking, or assembly). However, not much has been exploited in remanufacturing, in particular in disassembly tasks. This work presents the state of the art of contact-rich disassembly using reinforcement learning algorithms and a study about the generalisation of object extraction skills when applied to contact-rich disassembly tasks. The generalisation capabilities of two state-of-the-art reinforcement learning agents (trained in simulation) are tested and evaluated in simulation, and real world while perform a disassembly task. Results show that at least one of the agents can generalise the contact-rich extraction skill. Besides, this work identifies key concepts and gaps for the reinforcement learning algorithms' research and application on disassembly tasks.",Circular economy; Remanufacturing; Disassembly; Robotics; Reinforcement learning; Contact-rich manipulation
1646,Multi-PPTP: Multiple Probabilistic Pedestrian Trajectory Prediction in the Complex Junction Scene,"Li, Linhui; Zhou, Bin; Lian, Jing; Wang, Xuecheng; Zhou, Yafu","Pedestrian trajectory prediction in dynamic, multi-agent traffic junction scene is an important problem in the context of self-driving cars. Accurately predicting the trajectory of the agent, especially the pedestrian with high randomness, is of great significance to autonomous driving technology. In this paper, we propose Multi-PPTP, a novel trajectory prediction model that first utilizes a composite rasterized map to model the complex representations and interactions of road components, including dynamic obstacles (e.g., pedestrians, vehicles, and cyclists) and static road information (e.g., lanes, traffic lights, and sidewalks). Then it uses MapNet and AgentNet to extract spatio-temporal features by deep convolutional networks and LSTM to automatically derive relevant features, and next exploits Interaction-AttNet aggregate features to learn the high interactions among all components by affine transformation and multi-head attention mechanism. Additionally, we also propose a series of unique loss functions to predict multiple possible trajectories of each pedestrian while estimating their probabilities. Following extensive offline evaluation and comparison to the state-of-the-art models, our approach outperforms significantly the state-of-the-art models on our large scale in-house and public nuScenes dataset.",Autonomous driving; interaction; junction scene; trajectory prediction

Many detection algorithms have been proposed and will continue to be. Most of those algorithms measure their predictive power by running on simulated data many times under various disease models. However, we find that there have been subtle differences in interpreting the meaning of existing disease models among the previous studies on detection of epistatic interactions. We elucidate those differences and suggest that future studies on epistatic interactions in GWAS state explicitly which versions/interpretations are employed. We also provide a way to facilitate setting parameters of disease models.",GWAS; disease models; epistasis; simulation study.

Mutations in human NR5A1 are frequently associated with 46,XY disorders of sex development (DSD). We analysed a Pakistani cohort of patients with 46,XY DSD, presenting with variable degrees of gonadal dysgenesis, for NR5A1 mutations. The study identified three mutations (p.Tyr03X, p.Glu07X and p.Gln299HisfsX386), of which two are novel, in these patients with 46,XY DSD. The mutations, p.Tyr03X and novel p.Glu07X, are located in the coding region of the gene, corresponding to DNA-binding domain of the predicted protein. In silico analysis for the novel homozygous p.Gln299HisfsX386 mutation in ligand-binding domain of NR5A1 revealed subtle changes in overall tertiary conformation which is predicted to affect the normal physiology of this mutant protein. This study reveals two novel mutations with altered NR5A1 protein in twenty patients with 46,XY DSD, highlighting the critical role of NR5A1 protein in gonadal development and differentiation. In conclusion, the current and previous studies suggest that the NR5A1 mutations are present in around 8-15% of patients with 46,XY DSD presenting with gonadal dysgenesis. For the clinical utility of NR5A1 gene mutations, more comprehensive studies with large 46,XY DSD patient series in different populations are suggested.",46XY DSD; DNA sequencing; NR5A1; gonadal dysgenesis.
1650,The Violence of the Cut: Gendering Self-Harm,"Chandler, Amy; Simopoulou, Zoi","Taking as a starting point the frequent characterisation of self-harm as ""an adolescent thing for girls,"" this paper offers a sociologically informed, qualitative exploration of self-harm as a gendered practice. We move beyond statistical constructions of this ""reality,"" and critically examine how this characterisation comes to be, and some of its effects. Our data are drawn from a pilot study that developed a collaborative arts-based inquiry into meanings of self-harm. The authors worked with two groups: one of practitioners and another of people who had self-harmed, meeting over six sessions to discuss and make art in response to a range of themes relating to the interpretation and explanation of self-harm. Through data generation and analysis, we collaboratively seek to make sense of the gendering of self-harm, focusing on a series of dualistic Cartesian ""cuts"" between male and female, violence and vulnerability, and inside and outside. In conclusion, we call for more multi- and interdisciplinary explorations of self-harm, and greater use of diverse, arts-based, and qualitative methodologies, in order to further expand and nuance understandings and ethical engagements with self-harm, and those who are affected by it.",self-harm; gender; art
1651,Multi-Part Modeling and Segmentation of Left Atrium in C-Arm CT for Image-Guided Ablation of Atrial Fibrillation,"Zheng, Yefeng; Yang, Dong; John, Matthias; Comaniciu, Dorin","As a minimally invasive surgery to treat atrial fibrillation (AF), catheter based ablation uses high radio-frequency energy to eliminate potential sources of abnormal electrical events, especially around the ostia of pulmonary veins (PV). Fusing a patient- specific left atrium (LA) model (including LA chamber, appendage, and PVs) with electro-anatomical maps or overlaying the model onto 2-D real-time fluoroscopic images provides valuable visual guidance during the intervention. In this work, we present a fully automatic LA segmentation system on nongated C-arm computed tomography (C-arm CT) data, where thin boundaries between the LA and surrounding tissues are often blurred due to the cardiac motion artifacts. To avoid segmentation leakage, the shape prior should be exploited to guide the segmentation. A single holistic shape model is often not accurate enough to represent the whole LA shape population under anatomical variations, e. g., the left common PVs vs. separate left PVs. Instead, a part based LA model is proposed, which includes the chamber, appendage, four major PVs, and right middle PVs. Each part is a much simpler anatomical structure compared to the holistic one and can be segmented using a model-based approach (except the right middle PVs). After segmenting the LA parts, the gaps and overlaps among the parts are resolved and segmentation of the ostia region is further refined. As a common anatomical variation, some patients may contain extra right middle PVs, which are segmented using a graph cuts algorithm under the constraints from the already extracted major right PVs. Our approach is computationally efficient, taking about 2.6 s to process a volume with 256 x 256 x 245 voxels. Experiments on 687 C-arm CT datasets demonstrate its robustness and state-of-the-art segmentation accuracy.",Atrial fibrillation ablation; C-arm CT; left atrial appendage segmentation; left atrium modeling and segmentation; pulmonary vein segmentation
1652,Dense depth maps from correspondences derived from perceived motion,"Kirby, Richard; Whitaker, Ross","Many computer vision applications require finding corresponding points between images and using the corresponding points to estimate disparity. Today's correspondence finding algorithms primarily use image features or pixel intensities common between image pairs. Some 3-D computer vision applications, however, do not produce the desired results using correspondences derived from image features or pixel intensities. Two examples are the multimodal camera rig and the center region of a coaxial camera rig. We present an image correspondence finding technique that aligns pairs of image sequences using optical flow fields. The optical flow fields provide information about the structure and motion of the scene, which are not available in still images but can be used in image alignment. We apply the technique to a dual focal length stereo camera rig consisting of a visible light-infrared camera pair and to a coaxial camera rig. We test our method on real image sequences and compare our results with the state-of-the-art multimodal and structure from motion (SfM) algorithms. Our method produces more accurate depth and scene velocity reconstruction estimates than the state-of-the-art multimodal and SfM algorithms.

1653,Position-Constrained Stochastic Inference for Cooperative Indoor Localization,"Mendrzik, Rico; Bauch, Gerhard","We address the problem of distributed cooperative localization in wireless networks, i.e., nodes without prior position knowledge (agents) wish to determine their own positions. In non-cooperative approaches, positioning is only based on information from reference nodes with known positions (anchors). However, in cooperative positioning, information from other agents is considered as well. Cooperative positioning requires encoding of the uncertainties of agents' positions. 'lb cope with that demand, we consider stochastic inference for localization, which inherently takes the position uncertainties of agents into consideration. Generally, stochastic inference comes at the expense of high costs in terms of computation and information exchange. To relax the requirements of inference algorithms, we propose the framework of position--constrained stochastic inference, in which we first confine the positions of nodes to constrained regions. These regions assist inference algorithms to concentrate on the important areas of the sample space rather than the entire sample space. In contrast to many state-of-the-art approaches, our approach does not require prior knowledge on the positions of agents. We show through simulations that increased localization accuracy, reduced computational complexity, and quicker convergence can be achieved when compared to state-of-the-art non-constrained inference algorithms.",Cooperative localization; indoor localization; belief propagation; factor graphs; distributed processing

However, the potential for impairment of essential immune functions by HIF-1α (hypoxia-inducible factor 1α) inhibition demands a better comprehension of downstream hypoxia-dependent pathways that are amenable for manipulation. We assessed here whether hypoxia may interfere with the activity of AhR (aryl hydrocarbon receptor), a versatile environmental sensor highly expressed in the lungs, where it plays a homeostatic role. We used murine models of Aspergillus fumigatus infection in vivo and human cells in vitro to define the functional role of AhR in CF, evaluate the impact of hypoxia on AhR expression and activity, and assess whether AhR agonism may antagonize hypoxia-driven inflammation. We demonstrated that there is an important interferential cross-talk between the AhR and HIF-1α signaling pathways in murine and human CF, in that HIF-1α induction squelched the normal AhR response through an impaired formation of the AhR:ARNT (aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator)/HIF-1β heterodimer. However, functional studies and analysis of the AhR genetic variability in patients with CF proved that AhR agonism could prevent hypoxia-driven inflammation, restore immune homeostasis, and improve lung function. This study emphasizes the contribution of environmental factors, such as infections, in CF disease progression and suggests the exploitation of hypoxia:xenobiotic receptor cross-talk for antiinflammatory therapy in CF.",biopharmaceutics; microbial metabolites; therapeutics; tryptophan.

In both churches incense was burnt occasionally during Mass. The highest indoor PM(0.5-1) concentrations compared with outdoors (10.7 times higher) were observed in the church that burning of candles indoors was allowed. Peak indoor black carbon concentration was 6.8 mu g m(-3) in the instances that incense was burning and 13.4 mu g m(-3) in the instances that the candles were burning (outdoor levels ranged between 0.6 and 1.3 mu g m(-3)). From the water soluble inorganic components determined in PM(10), calcium prevailed in all samples indoors or outdoors, whilst high potassium concentration indoors were a clear marker of combustion. Indoor sources of PM were clearly identified and their emission strengths were estimated via modeling of the results. Indoor estimated PM(0.3-10) mass concentrations exceeded air quality standards for human health protection and for the preservation of works of art. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

This study aims to prepare carrageenan film containing essential oil with antibacterial properties. Oregano essential oil is successfully added into the carrageenan-based film using the Pickering emulsion method with cationic nanocellulose as stabilizer. The positive charge of nanocellulose enhances the stability of emulsion through strong electrostatic interaction with the Oregano Oil. FTIR spectra and SEM micrographs show the Oregano Pickering emulsion (OrePE) well dispersed in the polymer matrix and good compatibility with carrageenan film. The mechanical and thermal properties of carrageenan film were only slightly affected by the addition of OrePE. The tensile strength of films significantly decreased, whereas the elongation break increased following the addition of OrePE. Moreover, the addition of OrePE to the carageen film provides inhibitory effects on gram-positive (S. aureus) and gram negative (E. coli) bacteria. This innovative incorporation of essential oil into biopolymer films by Pickering emulsion technology may have implications for extending the shelf life of food products which is indicates that the material has the potential to be used in active packaging.",Carrageenan; Oregano oil; active packaging; cationic nanocellulose; pickering emulsion.

Nevertheless, marker detection is affected by noise and blur: small camera movements may cause image blurriness that prevents marker detection. The contribution of this paper is two-fold. First, it proposes a novel approach for estimating the location of markers in images using a set of Discriminative Correlation Filters (DCF). The proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods for marker detection and standard DCFs in terms of speed, precision, and sensitivity. Our method is robust to blur and scales very well with image resolution, obtaining more than 200fps in HD im-ages using a single CPU thread. As a second contribution, this paper proposes a method for camera localization with marker maps employing a predictive approach to detect visible markers with high precision, speed, and robustness to blurriness.

Accurate identification of the intersegmental plane is essential to achieve adequate surgical margins. Traditionally, the inflation-deflation method was used to identify the intersegmental plane. However, in recent years, various intersegmental plane identification methods, including systemic indocyanine green injection, have been reported and shown to be useful. The purpose of this review was to evaluate the identification rates, advantages, and disadvantages of various intersegmental identification methods in lung segmentectomy. There are primarily six methods: inflation-deflation method, selective segmental inflation, endobronchial dye injection, virtual-assisted lung mapping, systemic indocyanine green injection, and pure oxygen method. These are broadly classified into those that use bronchi and pulmonary arteries anatomically and those that use air and dye technically. In this review, all methods showed relatively high identification rates.

This causes a significant challenge when storing them on a local personal computer or communicating them over cyberspace. Therefore, a proficient image compression system is fundamentally required. From this perspective, this paper proposes a lossless image compression procedure by reducing image dimension and using a prediction technique. In the proposed strategy, the column dimension of a grey-scale image is first reduced and then the prediction errors are encoded using Huffman coding. The decoding process is carried out in the reverse direction. The proposed method is executed and applied to several bench-marked images. The performance of this proposed algorithm is assessed and compared with the state-of-the-art techniques based on several assessment criteria, such as average code length (ACL), compression ratio (CR), encoding time, decoding time, efficiency, peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR) and normalised correlation (NC).

The APS is an important converter component, which energizes the gate-drive units and, therefore, has an influence on the overall reliability and efficiency of the converter system. There has, however, been comparably little research on how the APS of high-power converter submodules can be realized, in particular, for high-voltage applications. New, or improved, solutions may build on state-of-the-art topologies in the near future, but utilize MV SiC technology in the APS circuit itself to enable improved efficiency, reliability, simplicity, and compactness. Externally-fed APS concepts could provide several further advantages. Their various benefits on converter and system level may enable them to be a competitive solution for future APS concepts. Especially, light-based power supply systems are considered most useful since they offer extreme voltage isolation capability and immunity to electromagnetic interference.

The vast majority of UTIs are caused by Gram-negative bacteria. Current culture-based pathogen identification methods may require up to 24 to 48 h of incubation. In this study, we developed and evaluated a method for Gram-negative pathogen identification direct from urine, without culture, via matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) in approximately 1 h. Urine samples were collected (n = 137) from the University of Maryland Medical Center clinical microbiology laboratory. To identify bacteria direct from urine, two methods were evaluated. First, 1 μL of urine was directly spotted onto the MALDI target plate, and second, 1 mL of urine was centrifuged at 8,000 rpm for 5 min before processing using the fast lipid analysis technique (FLAT). Mass spectra were acquired on the Bruker MALDI Biotyper sirius system in the negative-ion mode. Results were compared to those of standard culture methods. When 1 μL of urine was directly spotted, positive agreement was 81.5% (101/124) and, after centrifugation, 94.4% (117/124) relative to that of standard culture methods. Negative agreement for both methods was 100% (13/13). The time to results for both of the specimen preparation methods using the FLAT extraction protocol was approximately 1 h, with minimal hands-on time required (<5 min). The ability to rapidly identify pathogens directly from urine, without the need for culture, allows for faster turnaround times and, potentially, improved patient outcomes. Overall, the FLAT extraction protocol, in combination with lipid A identification, provides a reproducible and accurate method to rapidly identify urinary pathogens. IMPORTANCE This study describes and evaluates a direct-from-urine extraction method that allows identification of Gram-negative bacteria via MALDI-TOF MS within 1 h. Currently, identification of urinary pathogens requires 24 h of culture prior to identification. While this method may not replace culture, we demonstrate its utility in screening for common urinary pathogens. By providing identifications in under 1 h, clinicians can potentially treat patients sooner with more-targeted antimicrobial therapy. In turn, earlier treatment can improve patient outcome and antimicrobial stewardship. Furthermore, MADLI-TOF MS is a readily available, easy-to-use diagnostic tool in clinical laboratories, making implementation of this method possible.",Gram-negative bacteria; MALDI-TOF MS; MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry; UTI; fast lipid analysis technique; lipid A; urinary tract infection.

Consequently, the uncertainty regarding the correspondence between the image areas and the diagnostic labels assigned by pathologists at the slide level, and the need for identifying regions that belong to multiple classes with different clinical significances have emerged as two new challenges. However, generalizability of the state-of-the-art algorithms, whose accuracies were reported on carefully selected regions of interest (ROIs) for the binary benign versus cancer classification, to these multi-class learning and localization problems is currently unknown. This paper presents our potential solutions to these challenges by exploiting the viewing records of pathologists and their slide-level annotations in weakly supervised learning scenarios. First, we extract candidate ROIs from the logs of pathologists' image screenings based on different behaviors, such as zooming, panning, and fixation. Then, we model each slide with a bag of instances represented by the candidate ROIs and a set of class labels extracted from the pathology forms. Finally, we use four different multi-instance multi-label learning algorithms for both slide-level and ROI-level predictions of diagnostic categories in whole slide breast histopathology images. Slide-level evaluation using 5-class and 14-class settings showed average precision values up to 81% and 69%, respectively, under different weakly labeled learning scenarios. ROI-level predictions showed that the classifier could successfully perform multi-class localization and classification within whole slide images that were selected to include the full range of challenging diagnostic categories.",Digital pathology; breast histopathology; whole slide imaging; region of interest detection; weakly-labeled learning; multi-class classification

However, understanding the potential impact of PC microplastics on biological sludge treatment remains challenging. By tracking the changes in methane production under different concentrations of PC microplastics, a dose-dependent effect of PC microplastics on anaerobic digestion of sludge was observed. PC microplastics at 10-60 particles/g total solids (TS) improved methane production by up to 24.7 ± 0.1 % (at 30 particles/g TS), while 200 particles/g TS PC microplastics reduced methane production by 8.09 ± 0.1 %. Bisphenol A (BPA) leached from 30 particles/g TS PC microplastics (1.26 ± 0.18 mg/L) down-regulated intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, thereby enhancing enzyme activity, biomass viability, and abundance of methanogenic (Methanobacterium sp. and Methanosarcina sp.), ultimately boosting methane production. Conversely, BPA leached from 200 particles/g TS PC microplastics (4.02 ± 0.15 mg/L) stimulated ROS production, resulting in decreased biomass viability and even apoptosis.

The proposed method employs the 2D integer wavelet transform to decorrelate the data and an intraband prediction method to reduce the energy of the sub-bands by exploiting the anatomical symmetries typically present in structural medical images. A modified version of the embedded block coder with optimized truncation (EBCOT), tailored according to the characteristics of the data, encodes the residual data generated after prediction to provide resolution and quality scalability. Performance evaluations on a wide range of real 3D medical images show an average improvement of 15% in lossless compression ratios when compared to other state-of-the art lossless compression methods that also provide resolution and quality scalability including 3D-JPEG2000, JPEG2000, and H.264/AVC intra-coding.",Integer wavelet transform; lossless compression; medical image compression; scalability; symmetry
1669,Learning Collision-Free Space Detection From Stereo Images: Homography Matrix Brings Better Data Augmentation,"Fan, Rui; Wang, Hengli; Cai, Peide; Wu, Jin; Bocus, Mohammud Junaid; Qiao, Lei; Liu, Ming","Collision-free space detection is a critical component of autonomous vehicle perception. The state-of-the-art algorithms are typically based on supervised deep learning. Their performance is dependent on the quality and amount of labeled training data. It remains an open challenge to train deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) using only a small quantity of training samples. Therefore, in this article, we mainly explore an effective training data augmentation approach that can be employed to improve the overall DCNN performance, when additional images captured from different views are available. Due to the fact that the pixels in collision-free space (generally regarded as a planar surface) between two images, captured from different views, can be associated using a homography matrix, the target image can be transformed into the reference view. This provides a simple but effective way to generate training data from additional multiview images. Extensive experimental results, conducted with six state-of-the-art semantic segmentation DCNNs on three datasets, validate the effectiveness of the proposed method for enhancing collision-free space detection performance. When validated on the KITTI road benchmark, our approach provides the best results, compared with other state-of-the-art stereo vision-based collision-free space detection approaches.",Transmission line matrix methods; Roads; Semantics; Cameras; Training data; Three-dimensional displays; Mechatronics; Collision-free space detection; data augmentation; homography matrix; supervised deep learning

Diego; Cremaschi, Mauro","The preservation of rock art in open-air contexts is a global issue controlled by several environmental processes, which are less investigated than the cultural significance of engravings and paintings. For that reason, we discuss the age, preservation, and palaeoenvironmental context of petroglyphs discovered on the flat, almost vertical face of a large boulder fallen along the western slope of Jabal Hammah, a rocky hill that borders the oasis of Salut (northern Sultanate of Oman). Geoarchaeological investigation highlighted that, in the region, the preservation of petroglyphs is due to the interplay of two contrasting weathering processes. On one hand, karst dissolution - even if it is a very slow process in arid and semi-arid lands - gradually levels the surface of boulders. On the other hand, a biomineralized Mn- and Fe-rich rock varnish has developed inside the grooves of the engravings, thus sheltering them from extreme dissolution and promoting the preservation of the pristine shape of the representations. Moreover, organics trapped within the rock varnish have been radiocarbon dated to 2600 +/- 60 uncal. years BP. This result allows establishing a limit ante quem for the production of these specific engravings and to root it to the Bronze or Iron Age exploitation of the area. This result is of particular relevance in a region where well-dated rock art is virtually absent. Today, the biogeochemical processes leading to the formation of the protective crust are almost inactive, and not consistent with the present dry environmental settings. Their occurrence is in accordance with other local palaeoclimatic record, and suggests Bronze and Iron Age climatic conditions wetter than today. A broader implication of our work is that it shows how a multidisciplinary approach to the study of rock art provides the opportunity of understanding the age of rock art and its paleoenvironmental significance. We demonstrate that physical, chemical, and biological weathering processes are in charge of the preservation and/or destruction of rock art; such processes have to be seriously taken into account in projects of rock art field assessment.",Rock art; Rock weathering; Microscopy; Climate change; Radiocarbon; Sultanate of Oman
1671,Fixed-Point NLMS and IPNLMS VLSI Architectures for Accurate FECG and FHR Processing,"da Costa, Patricia Ucker; Paim, Guilherme; Giacomini Rocha, Leandro Mateus; Cesar da Costa, Eduardo Antonio; Melo de Almeida, Sergio Jose; Bampi, Sergio","Capturing signals without noise and interference while monitoring the maternal abdomen's fetal electrocardiogram (FECG) is a challenging task. This method can provide fetal monitoring for long hours, not harming the pregnant woman or the fetus. Such non-invasive FECG raw signal suffers from various interference sources as the bio-electric maternal potentials include her ECG component. Therefore, a critical step in the non-invasive FECG is to design the filtering of components derived from the maternal ECG. There is an increasing demand for portable devices to extract a pure FECG signal and to detect fetal heart rate (FHR) with precision. Dedicated CMOS architectures enable higher energy efficiency in portable devices. This paper proposes VLSI architectures dedicated to FECG extraction and FHR processing. Fixed-point architectures for the FECG detection exploring the NLMS (normalized least mean square), IPNLMS (improved proportional NLMS), and three different division VLSI CMOS architectures are designed herein. An architecture based on the Pan-Tompkins algorithm that processes the FECG for extracting the FHR, extending the functionally of the system, is also proposed. The results show that the NLMS and IPNLMS based architectures effectively detect the R-peaks of FECG with a detection accuracy of 92.86% and 93.75%, respectively. The synthesis results shows that our NLMS architecture proposal saves 13.3 % energy, due to a reduction of 279 clock cycles, compared to the state of the art. On the other hand, the IPNLMS algorithm results in +0.89% detection accuracy at the price of 42% additional energy consumption w.r.t NLMS.",Mathematical models; Signal to noise ratio; Very large scale integration; Pregnancy; Fetus; Fetal heart rate; Electrocardiography; FECG signal; FHR signal; hardware architectures; NLMS algorithm; IPNLMS algorithm
1672,Relationship Between Weather and Changes in Annual and Seasonal Abundance of Culicoides sonorensis (Diptera: Ceratopogonidae) in Alberta,"T J Lysyk,I Couloigner,A Massolo,S C Cork,T J Lysyk,I Couloigner,A Massolo,S C Cork","Factors influencing annual and seasonal abundance of Culicoides sonorensis (Wirth and Jones) (Diptera; Ceratopogonidae) were examined at 10 sites in southern Alberta using negative binomial regression. Annual abundance varied among locations with greatest abundance in a narrow geographic band between -112.17 and -112.64°W longitude and 49.32 and 50.17°N latitude. Sites were grouped depending on whether abundance was continuous and high; discontinuous and low; or sporadic and low without much loss of information. Maximum annual abundance declined with spring precipitation, increased with spring temperature, and was unrelated to spring relative humidity, suggesting that abundance is highest during years with early drought conditions. Seasonal abundance was associated with the same factors but was further influenced by temperature and relative humidity during the sample intervals. Lagged effects were apparent, suggesting abundance increased with warmer temperatures over a six-week period, and increased when relative humidity declined closer to the sampling period. Predicted values were slightly biased and tended to overestimate observed data, but this could be adjusted using calibration curves. The model can also be used to predict presence/absence of C. sonorensis and will be useful for developing risk assessments.",Culicoides sonorensis; abundance; bluetongue; epizootic hemorrhagic disease; negative binomial regression.
1673,Crowd Counting in Low-Resolution Crowded Scenes Using Region-Based Deep Convolutional Neural Networks,"Saqib, Muhammad; Khan, Sultan Daud; Sharma, Nabin; Blumenstein, Michael","Crowd counting and density estimation is an important and challenging problem in the visual analysis of the crowd. Most of the existing approaches use regression on density maps for the crowd count from a single image. However, these methods cannot localize individual pedestrian and therefore cannot estimate the actual distribution of pedestrians in the environment. On the other hand, detection-based methods detect and localize pedestrians in the scene, but the performance of these methods degrades when applied in high-density situations. To overcome the limitations of pedestrian detectors, we proposed a motion-guided filter (MGF) that exploits spatial and temporal information between consecutive frames of the video to recover missed detections. Our framework is based on the deep convolution neural network (DCNN) for crowd counting in the low-to-medium density videos. We employ various state-of-the-art network architectures, namely, Visual Geometry Group (VGG16), Zeiler and Fergus (ZF), and VGGM in the framework of a region-based DCNN for detecting pedestrians. After pedestrian detection, the proposed motion guided filter is employed. We evaluate the performance of our approach on three publicly available datasets. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, which significantly improves the performance of the state-of-the-art detectors.",Deep convolutional neural networks; crowd counting and density estimation; Motion Guided Filter; faster R-CNN

However, they are prone to overfitting and several regularization techniques have been proposed to mitigate this effect. In this paper, we propose the semi-supervised class sparsity signature based RBM formulation by combining unsupervised generative training of the RBM with a supervised sparsity regularizer. The proposed approach, termed as cssRBM, enforces sparsity at the class level to ensure that coherent and discriminative representations are learnt during training. Combining unsupervised learning with supervised learning allows the model to utilize external training data to learn better generative features while the supervised learning enables fine-tuning for discrimination using the learned features. We construct both DBMs and DBN5 with cssRBM units and evaluate the performance on multiple publicly available benchmark datasets. Experiments on the MNIST and CIFAR-10 databases demonstrate that the proposed approaches are comparable with state-of-the-art deep learning architectures in the literature. We also evaluate the performance on one of the most challenging face databases, i.e., the Point and Shoot Challenge dataset. The results show that the proposed approaches improve state-of-the-art results by 15% on the PaSC database. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

W.; de Jong, Pim A.; Prokop, Mathias; van Ginneken, Bram","We present a novel descriptor for the characterization of pulmonary nodules in computed tomography (CT) images. The descriptor encodes information on nodule morphology and has scale-invariant and rotation-invariant properties. Information on nodule morphology is captured by sampling intensity profiles along circular patterns on spherical surfaces centered on the nodule, in a multi-scale fashion. Each intensity profile is interpreted as a periodic signal, where the Fourier transform is applied, obtaining a spectrum. A library of spectra is created and labeled via unsupervised clustering, obtaining a Bag-of-Frequencies, which is used to assign each spectra a label. The descriptor is obtained as the histogram of labels along all the spheres. Additional contributions are a technique to estimate the nodule size, based on the sampling strategy, as well as a technique to choose the most informative plane to cut a 2-D view of the nodule in the 3-D image. We evaluate the descriptor on several nodule morphology classification problems, namely discrimination of nodules versus vascular structures and characterization of spiculation. We validate the descriptor on data from European screening trials NELSON and DLCST and we compare it with state-of-the-art approaches for 3-D shape description in medical imaging and computer vision, namely SPHARM and 3-D SIFT, outperforming them in all the considered experiments.",Chest computed tomography (CT); computer-aided detection; frequency analysis; nodule characterization; pulmonary nodules; three-dimensional (3-D) descriptor

In comparison with well-known PET-RAFT polymerization, photo-deactivation RAFT (PD-RAFT) polymerization can be temporally stopped with UV light ON, where photoresponsive HABI can reversibly quench propagating radicals, resulting in switchable RAFT polymerization.

The state-of-the-art zero frequency filtering technique is a simple and efficient method that shows robustness in extracting the epochs from clean speech. However, this method has shown poor performance for telephonic quality speech, due to the presence of spurious zero crossings in epoch evidence, which leads to a high false alarm rate. Recently,zero-phase zero frequency resonator(ZP-ZFR) an alternative tozero frequency filteris proposed for stable implementation of zero frequency filtering technique. In this study, higher-order ZP-ZFR is investigated to improve the performance of zero frequency filtering for epoch extraction from telephonic speech. The performance of the proposed ZP-ZFR method is quantitatively evaluated on telephonic speech simulated using six standard databases having simultaneous electroglottograph recordings as ground truth. Experimental results suggest that the performance of the proposed method is significantly better than the state-of-the-art methods in terms of identification rate and false alarm rate.",Epoch extraction; Telephonic speech; Zero-phase zero frequency filtering

As a type of pattern-recognition receptor, receptor-like proteins (RLPs) are considered vital regulators of plant immunity. Based on genome-wide identification, bioinformatic analysis, and functional determination, we investigated the evolutionary characteristics of RLPs, and specifically those that regulate Valsa canker, a devastating fungal disease affecting apple and pear production. A total of 3028 RLPs from the genomes of 19 species, including nine Rosaceae, were divided into 24 subfamilies. Five subfamilies and seven co-expression modules were found to be involved in the responses to Valsa canker signals of the resistant pear rootstock Pyrus betulifolia 'Duli-G03'. Fourteen RLPs were subsequently screened as candidate genes for regulation of resistance. Among these, PbeRP23 (Chr13.g24394) and PbeRP27 (Chr16.g31400) were identified as key resistance genes that rapidly enhance the resistance of 'Duli-G03' and strongly initiate immune responses, and hence they have potential for further functional exploration and breeding applications for resistance to Valsa canker. In addition, as a consequence of this work we have established optimal methods for the classification and screening of disease-resistant RLPs.",Pyrus; Biotic stress; Rosaceae; Valsa canker; co-expression analysis; expansion rate; gene duplication; receptor-like protein (RLP).

High-resolution electrogastrogram (HR-EGG) has shown sufficient sensitivity as a noninvasive clinical marker to objectively detect distinct gastric slow wave properties in children with functional nausea. We hypothesized that the increased precision of magnetogastrogram (MGG) slow wave recordings could provide supplementary information not evident on HR-EGG. We evaluated simultaneous pre- and postprandial MGG and HR-EGG recordings in pediatric patients with chronic nausea and healthy asymptomatic subjects, while also measuring nausea intensity and nausea severity. We found significant reductions in postprandial dominant frequency and normogastric power, and higher levels of postprandial bradygastric power in patients with nausea in both MGG and HR-EGG. MGG also detected significantly lower preprandial normogastric power in patients. A significant difference in the mean preprandial gastric slow wave propagation direction was observed in patients as compared with controls in both MGG (control: 180 ± 61°, patient: 34 ±72°; P < 0.05) and HR-EGG (control: 240 ± 39°, patient: 180 ± 46°; P < 0.05). Patients also showed a significant change in the mean slow wave direction between pre- and postprandial periods in MGG (P < 0.05). No statistical differences were observed in propagation speed between healthy subjects and patients in either MGG or HR-EGG pre/postprandial periods. The use of MGG and/or HR-EGG represents an opportunity to assess noninvasively the effects of chronic nausea on gastric slow wave activity. MGG data may offer the opportunity for further refinement of the more portable and economical HR-EGG in future machine-learning approaches for functional nausea.NEW & NOTEWORTHY Pediatric chronic nausea is a difficult-to-measure subjective complaint that requires objective diagnosis, clinical assessment, and individualized treatment plans. Our study demonstrates that multichannel MGG used in conjunction with custom HR-EGG detects key pathological signatures of functional nausea in children. This quantifiable measure may allow more personalized diagnosis and treatment in addition to minimizing the cost and potential radiation associated with current diagnostic approaches.",chronic nausea; gastric slow wave; magnetogastrogram; pediatric.

We evaluated and integrated top 15 superpixel algorithms, whose code are publicly available, into one code library and, provide a quantitative comparison of these algorithms. We find that some superpixel algorithms perform consistently better than others. Clustering based superpixel algorithms are more efficient than graph-based ones. Furthermore, we also introduced a novel metric to evaluate superpixel regularity, which is a property that superpixels desired. The evaluation results demonstrate the performance and limitations of state-of-the-art algorithms.

1682,Association of Diet With Essential Tremor: A Narrative Review,"Anaiska Ray,Dalia A Biswas,Anaiska Ray,Dalia A Biswas","Essential tremor is a neurological disorder categorized by the rhythmic shaking of the upper limbs, lower limbs, neck, or head. The etiology of essential tremor is believed to be genetic variations, environmental factors, lifestyle, etc. Poor lifestyle and diet are important factors contributing to the onset of various disorders. Environment and lifestyle play a significant part in the dietary habits of an individual. Some diet components may probably be associated with the etiopathogenesis or progression of the essential tremor. Dietary habits may be a key influence on the commencement of tremors in healthy individuals. Typically, the diet of essential tremor patients is not supervised. It may also intensify the tremors in essential tremor patients. Association of the diet with the essential tremor can shed light on the root of tremor aggravating aspect and aid in diet modification in essential tremor patients. The aim of the review is to establish a relation between the diet with etiopathogenesis and the progression of essential tremor. The review includes studies providing information about essential tremor and correlating essential tremor with diet, lifestyle, environment, and genetic factors. Studies that did not provide a link to the association of essential tremor were excluded. The interpretation of the research indicated that genetic variations might be triggered due to enzymatic changes triggered by dietary patterns. Dietary components showed ambiguous, weak, strong, or no association. Essential tremor may be influenced by diet. Further research must be carried out on essential tremor patients in the nutritional domain. Physicians may monitor the diet of the essential tremor patients and record the progress of the disorder on its basis to manage the patients with essential tremor and provide better services.",diet and essential tremor; essential tremor; essential tremor management; hand tremor; onset of essential tremor; progression of essential tremor.

However, relatively few methodologically rigorous studies have been conducted in the Global South, particularly in post-conflict settings where forgiveness could play an important role in supporting individual well-being. In this three-wave cohort study of predominantly young adult Colombians (n = 1575), we examined the associations of dispositional forgivingness with 20 well-being outcomes across several domains of well-being: psychological distress, psychological well-being, physical health, social well-being, and character strengths/virtues. Using an outcome-wide analytic design that included extensive control for potential confounding and reverse causation by adjusting for a range of covariates assessed in Wave 1 (2017), we found that dispositional forgivingness assessed in Wave 2 (2018) was at least modestly associated with improvements in one or more facet of each well-being domain assessed approximately 1 year later in Wave 3 (2019). Associations tended to be stronger for outcomes in the domains of psychological distress, psychological well-being, social well-being, and character strengths/virtues compared to the physical health domain. These longitudinal findings suggest that dispositional forgivingness might promote individual well-being in societies with a long history of ongoing civil unrest, conflict, and war.",Forgiveness; Health; Longitudinal; Outcome-wide design; Well-being.

Here, this limitation is addressed by designing a novel 3D mechanical metamaterial that is capable of undergoing a phase transition from positive to negative Poisson's ratio under compression, without significant degradation of Young's modulus (i.e. the phase transition is elastically-stable). The metamaterial is fabricated by two-photon lithography at the micro-scale and its mechanical behavior is assessed experimentally.

V.; Hansen, David; Poulsen, Per; Sorensen, Thomas Sangild","We present a new method for reconstruction of 4-D cone beam computed tomography from an undersampled set of X-ray projections. The novelty of the proposed method lies in utilizing optical flow based registration to facilitate that each temporal phase is reconstructed from the full set of acquired projections. The reconstruction of each phase thus exhibits limited aliasing despite significant intra-phase undersampling. The method is fully self-contained. Initially an approximate 4-D volume is reconstructed and an inter-phase registration based hereon. A subsequent reconstruction pass integrates the optical flow estimation in a cost function formulation in which the X-ray projections from all temporal phases are considered for the reconstruction of each individual phase. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations were performed through reconstruction of both a numerical phantom and a clinical dataset.

1691,The effects of intraspecific variation on forecasts of species range shifts under climate change,"Wang-Hui Song,Jing-Jing Li,Wang-Hui Song,Jing-Jing Li","As global climate change is altering the distribution range of macroalgae across the globe, it is critical to assess its impact on species range shifts to inform the biodiversity conservation of macroalgae. Latitude/environmental gradients could cause intraspecific variability, which may result in distinct responses to climate change. It remains unclear whether geographical variation occurs in the response of species' populations to climate change. We tested this assumption using the brown alga Sargassum thunbergii, a habitat-forming macroalgae encompassing multiple divergent lineages along the Northwest Pacific. Previous studies revealed a distinct lineage of S. thunbergii in rear-edge populations. Given the phylogeographic structure and temperature gradients, we divided these populations into the southern and northern groups. We assessed the physiological responses of the two groups to temperature changes and estimated their niche differences using n-dimensional hypervolumes. A higher photosynthetic rate and antioxidative abilities were detected in the southern group of S. thunbergii than in the northern group. In addition, significant niche differentiation was detected between the two groups, suggesting the possibility for local adaptation. Given these results, we inferred that the southern group (rear-edge populations) may be more resilient to climate change. To examine climate-driven range shifts of S. thunbergii, we constructed species- and lineage-level species distribution models (SDMs). Predictions of both levels showed considerable distribution contracts along the Chinese coasts in the future. For the southern group, the lineage-level model predicted less habitat loss than the species-level model. Our results highlight the importance of considering intraspecific variation in climate change vulnerability assessments for coastal species.",Climate change; Ecological modelling; Intraspecific variation; Sargassum thunbergii; Species distribution models; Temperature.
1692,Decorrelating Feature Spaces for Learning General-Purpose Audio Representations,"Ghosh, Sreyan; Seth, Ashish; Umesh, S.","Inspired by the recent progress in self-supervised learning for computer vision, in this paper, through the DeLoRes (Decorrelating latent spaces for Low Resource audio representation learning) framework, we introduce two new general-purpose audio representation learning approaches, the DeLoRes-S and DeLoRes-M. Our main objective is to make our network learn representations in a resource-constrained setting (both data and compute) that can generalize well across a diverse set of downstream tasks. Inspired by the Barlow Twins objective function, we propose learning embeddings invariant to distortions of an input audio sample while ensuring that they contain non-redundant information about the sample. We call this the DeLoRes learning framework, which we employ in different fashions with the DeLoRes-S and DeLoRes-M. In our experiments, we learn audio representations with less than half the number of model parameters and 10% audio samples compared to state-of-the-art algorithms to achieve state-of-the-art results on 7 out of 11 tasks on linear evaluation and 4 out of 11 tasks in the finetuning setup. In addition to being simple and intuitive, our pre-training procedure is amenable to compute through its inherent nature of construction. Furthermore, we conduct extensive ablation studies on our training algorithm, model architecture, and results and make all our code and pre-trained models publicly available(1).",Task analysis; Speech processing; Representation learning; Predictive models; Linear programming; Art; Acoustics; Self-supervised learning; audio classification; representation learning
1693,LCANet: Learnable Connected Attention Network for Human Identification Using Dental Images,"Lai, Yancun; Fan, Fei; Wu, Qingsong; Ke, Wenchi; Liao, Peixi; Deng, Zhenhua; Chen, Hu; Zhang, Yi","Forensic odontology is regarded as an important branch of forensics dealing with human identification based on dental identification. This paper proposes a novel method that uses deep convolution neural networks to assist in human identification by automatically and accurately matching 2-D panoramic dental X-ray images. Designed as a top-down architecture, the network incorporates an improved channel attention module and a learnable connected module to better extract features for matching. By integrating associated features among all channel maps, the channel attention module can selectively emphasize interdependent channel information, which contributes to more precise recognition results. The learnable connected module not only connects different layers in a feed-forward fashion but also searches the optimal connections for each connected layer, resulting in automatically and adaptively learning the connections among layers. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method can achieve new state-of-the-art performance in human identification using dental images. Specifically, the method is tested on a dataset including 1,168 dental panoramic images of 503 different subjects, and its dental image recognition accuracy for human identification reaches 87.21% rank-1 accuracy and 95.34% rank-5 accuracy.

Extant research has therefore developed various fraud detection methods using supervised machine learning. However, sufficient labeled data are rarely available and their detection performance is negatively affected by the extreme class imbalance in financial fraud data. The purpose of this study is to propose an XGBoost-based fraud detection framework while considering the financial consequences of fraud detection systems. The framework was empirically validated on a large dataset of more than 6 million mobile transactions. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework, we conducted a comparative evaluation of existing machine learning methods designed for modeling imbalanced data and outlier detection. The results suggest that in terms of standard classification measures, the proposed semi-supervised ensemble model integrating multiple unsupervised outlier detection algorithms and an XGBoost classifier achieves the best results, while the highest cost savings can be achieved by combining random under-sampling and XGBoost methods. This study has therefore financial implications for organizations to make appropriate decisions regarding the implementation of effective fraud detection systems.",Fraud detection; Imbalanced data; Machine learning; Mobile payment; Outlier detection.

Here we have identified heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) as a major protein that associates with the cytoplasmic domain of the integrin β7 subunit. HSPs are molecular chaperones that protect cells from stress but more recently have been reported to also regulate cell adhesion and invasion via modulation of β1, β2, and β3 integrins and integrin-associated signalling molecules. Several HSP70 isoforms including HSP70-3, HSP70-1L, HSP70-8, and HSP70-9 were specifically precipitated from T cells by a bead-conjugated β7 subunit cytoplasmic domain peptide and subsequently identified by high-resolution liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. In confirmation, the β7 subunit was co-immunoprecipitated from a T cell lysate by an anti-HSP70 antibody. Further, recombinant human HSP70-1a was precipitated by β7 cytoplasmic domain-coupled beads. The HSP70 inhibitor KNK437 decreased the expression of HSP70 without affecting the expression of the β7 integrin. It significantly inhibited α4β7-mediated adhesion of T cells to mucosal addressin cell adhesion molecule 1 (MAdCAM-1), suggesting HSP70 is critical for maintaining β7 integrin signalling function. The functional implications of the association of β7 integrins with the different isoforms of HSP70 warrants further investigation.",Cytoplasmic domain; Heat shock protein 70; Immunoprecipitation; Integrin α4β7; Mass spectrometry.

Using a linear mixed effects model, we found that regardless of the race of the image being presented in the vignette, concern regarding COVID-19 transmission was associated with respondents' older age (b = 0.029, p < 0.001), residing in NYC (b = 0.556, p = 0.009), being heterosexual (b = 1.075, p < 0.001), having higher levels of education, that is, completion of a Bachelor's degree (b = 1.10, p = 0.033) or graduate degree (b = 1.78, p < 0.001), and the person in the vignette being unmasked (b = 0.822, p < 0.001). Asian respondents were more likely than White respondents to be concerned regarding COVID-19. Individuals who self-reported themselves to be at high risk for COVID-19 were more likely to be concerned about COVID-19 over those who considered themselves to be low risk.

With respect to anti-HCMV activity, trimer6 is the most efficient hybrid (IC50 0.04 μM) outperforming ganciclovir (IC50 2.6 μM), dihydroartemisinin(IC50 >10 μM) and artesunic acid (IC50 3.8 μM).",Anticancer activity; Antimalarial activity; Antiviral activity; Artemisinin-derived dimers; Artemisinin-derived hybrids; Artemisinin-derived trimers.
1698,On the practical design of small terminal antennas for mobile applications,"Skrivervik, Anja K.; Martinez-Vazquez, Marta; Mosig, Juan R.","Mobile communication have become an important part of telecommunications. Original applications like paging, mobile phones or GPS have shown a tremendous growth, and new applications are emerging every day: tagging, wireless computer links, wireless microphones, remote control, wireless multimedia links, satellite mobile phones, wireless internet. Mobile means light, small, with low energy consumption and appealing designs. Technology has evolved very fast to satisfy these needs in rapidly growing markeds: chips are becoming smaller, consume less current, are more efficient and perform more complex operations. The antennas however have not experienced the same evolution, as the size of an antenna is mainly dictated by the frequency band it has to transmit or receive. Thus, the art of antenna miniaturization is an art of compromise: one has to design the smallest possible antenna, which is still suitable for a given application regarding its radiation characteristics. Or in other words, one looks for the best compromise between volume, bandwidth and efficiency. In this paper, we will go through classical design techniques, starting from ultra small antennas and going UWB antennas over multiband designs.",small terminal antennas; miniaturization; multifrequency antennas; ultra WideBand
1699,One-Domain-One-Input: Adaptive Random Testing by Orthogonal Recursive Bisection With Restriction,"Ackah-Arthur, Hilary; Chen, Jinfu; Toweye, Dave; Omari, Michael; Xi, Jiaxiang; Huang, Rubing","One goal of software testing may be the identification or generation of a series of test cases that can detect a fault with as few test executions as possible. Motivated by insights from research into failure-causing regions of input domains, the even-spreading (even distribution) of tests across the input domain has been identified as a useful heuristic to more quickly find failures. This finding has encouraged a shift in focus from traditional random testing (RT) to its enhancement, adaptive random testing (ART), which retains the randomness of test input selection, but also attempts to maintain a more evenly distributed spread of test inputs across the input domain. Given that there are different ways to achieve the even distribution, several different ART methods and approaches have been proposed. This paper presents a new ART method, called ART by orthogonal recursive bisection (ART-ORB), which explores the advantages of repeated geometric bisection of the input domain, combined with restriction regions, to evenly spread test inputs. Experimental results show a better performance in terms of fewer test executions than RT to find failures. Compared with other ART methods, ART-ORB has comparable performance (in terms of required test executions), but incurs lower test input selection overheads, especially in higher dimensional input space. It is recommended that ART-ORB can be used in testing situations involving expensive test input execution.",Subspace constraints; Strips; Binary trees; Computational modeling; Software testing; Computer science; Adaptive random testing (ART); orthogonal recursive bisection; partition testing; random testing (RT); restricted random testing

However, the effects of PBA seem to be very cell-type-specific and sometimes limited exclusively to a particular cell line. Here, we provided novel information concerning cellular effects of PBA in LN-229 and LN-18 glioblastoma cell lines which have not been previously evaluated in context of PBA exposure. We found that LN-18 cells were PBA-insensitive even at high concentrations of PBA. In contrary, in LN-229 cells, 5 and 15 mmol/L PBA inhibited cell growth and proliferation mainly by causing prominent changes in cell morphology and promoting S- and G2/M-dependent cell cycle arrest. Moreover, we observed nearly a 3-fold increase in apoptosis of LN-229 cells treated with 15 mmol/L PBA, in comparison to control. Furthermore, PBA was found to up-regulate the expression of p21 whereas p53 expression level remained unchanged. We also showed that PBA down-regulated the expression of the anti-apoptotic genes Bcl-2/Bcl-X L , however without affecting the expression of pro-apoptotic Bax and Bim. Taken together, our results suggest that PBA might potentially be considered as an agent slowing-down the progress of glioblastoma; however, further analyses are still needed to comprehensively resolve the nature of its activity in this type of cancer.",Apoptosis; Cell cycle; Glioblastoma; Histone deacetylase inhibitors; Phenylbutyrate.

We used serum free (SFM) and charcoal stripped serum (csFBS) culture media as models of cellular stress to modulate calbindin D28k expression and identify regulatory cis-elements and trans-acting factors in kidney and beta cells. The murine calbindin-D28k promoter activity was significantly upregulated under SFM or csFBS condition. Promoter analysis revealed evolutionary conserved regulatory cis-elements and deletion of 23 nt from +117/+139 as critical for basal transcription. Bioinformatics analysis of the promoter revealed conserved NFAT and TFII regulators elements. Forced expression of NFAT stimulated promoter activity. Inhibition of NFAT transcriptional activity by FK506 attenuated calbindin-D28k expression. TFII-I was shown to be necessary for basal promoter activity and to act cooperatively with NFAT. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays, NFAT was shown to bind to both proximal and distal promoter regions. ChIP assays also revealed recruitment of TFII to the -36/+139 region. Knockdown of TFII-I decreased promoter activity. In summary, calbindin-D28k expression during serum deprivation is partly regulated by NFAT and TF-II. This regulation may be important in vivo during ischemia and growth factor withdrawal to regulate cellular function and maintenance.",Apoptosis; Calbindin-D28k; Calcium binding proteins; NFAT transcription factors; Serum deprivation; TFII-I.

The state-of-the-art methods for synthesizing quasi-arbitrary group delay functions using all-pass elements lack a theoretical synthesis procedure that guarantees minimum-order networks. We present an analytically-based solution to this problem that produces an all-pass network with a response approximating the required group delay to within an arbitrary minimax error. For the first time, this method is shown to work for any physical realization of second-order all-pass elements, is guaranteed to converge to a global optimum solution without any choice of seed values as an input, and allows synthesis of pre-defined networks described both analytically and numerically. The proposed method is also demonstrated by reducing the delay variation of a practical system by any desired amount, and compared to state-of-the-art methods in comparison examples.",All-pass circuits; approximation problem; analog signal processing; delay ripple equalization; group delay engineering; linear phase filters

In human medicine, it is well documented that matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are involved in the destruction of the periodontium. Therefore, the aim of this prospective study was to investigate the impact of MMPs and their inhibitors, the TIMPs (tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases), on canine periodontitis. The oral cavities of 57 dogs were examined clinically and radiologically. Gingival biopsies were obtained from the examined dogs and histologically analysed via haematoxylin and eosin stained sections. Immunohistological detection of MMP-2, MMP-3, MMP-8 and MMP-9 as well as TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 was performed by the avidin-biotin peroxidase complex technique. All sections were evaluated by light microscopy. Statistically significant positive correlations were detected between the histologically verified degree of inflammation and the expression of MMP-2, MMP-3, MMP-8 and MMP-9 as well as between changes in collagen fibre content and the occurrence of MMP-2, MMP-8 and MMP-9. Concerning TIMP-1 and TIMP-2, non-significant, generally negative correlations were observed. In summary, in canine periodontitis, an increased expression of the above mentioned MMPs and a tendentially decreased expression of TIMPs are present. In conclusion, in canine periodontitis, a MMP-TIMP imbalance is suggestive of contributing to the destruction of the periodontium.",dog; immunohistology; matrix metalloproteinases; periodontitis.

Conventional methods in literature either lose valuable sensor data or inadequately decrease the power line noise. Instead of filtering out predetermined frequencies, adaptively estimating the spectrum of PM can provide better performance. This paper introduces an online adaptive algorithm that removes the power line interference in real time without disturbing the true EMG data. Our method sequentially processes the biomedical signal to properly estimate and remove the PLI component. Through experiments with real EMG data, we compared our method to the five state-of-the-art techniques. Our algorithm outperformed all of them with the highest SNR gain (3.6 dB on average) and with the least disturbance of the true EMG signal (0.0152 dB loss on average). Our method reduces the PLI the most while keeping the valuable sensor data loss at its minimum in comparison to the state-of-the-art. Reducing the noise without disturbing the valuable sensor data provides higher quality signals with decreased interference, which can be better processed and used in biomedical research.",EMG data analysis; PLI cancellation; adaptive filtering; spectrum estimation; online learning

UV-based advanced oxidation processes (UV-AOPs) have emerged as promising oxidative treatment technologies to eliminate recalcitrant chemicals and biological contaminants in drinking water. UV-AOPs inevitably alter the properties of natural organic matter (NOM) and affect the disinfection byproduct (DBP) formation in the post-disinfection. This paper provides a state-of-the-art review on the effects of UV-AOPs on the changes of NOM properties and the consequent impacts on DBP formation in the post-chlorination process. A tutorial review to the connotations of NOM properties (e.g., bulk properties, fractional constituents, and molecular structures) and the associated state-of-the-art analytical methods are firstly presented. The impacts of different radical-based AOPs on the changes of NOM properties together with the underlying NOM-radical reaction mechanisms are discussed. The impacts of alteration of NOM properties on DBP formation in the post-chlorination process are then reviewed. The current knowledge gaps and future research needs are finally presented, with emphases on the needs to strengthen the comparability of research data in literature, the accuracy in quantifying the reactive moieties of NOM, and the awareness of unknown DBPs in oxidative water treatment processes. The review and discussion improve the fundamental understanding of NOM-radical and NOM-chlorine chemistry.

These applications are widely popular NoSQL databases with different data models and features such as in-memory storage. We compare how these data-serving applications behave with respect to other well-known benchmarks, such as SPEC CPU2006, PARSEC and NAS Parallel Benchmark. The methodology employed for evaluation relies on state-of-the-art full-system simulation tools, such as gem5. This allows us to explore configurations unattainable using performance monitoring units in actual hardware, being able to characterize memory properties. The results obtained suggest that NoSQL application behavior is not dissimilar to conventional workloads. Therefore, some of the optimizations present in state-of-the-art hardware might have a direct benefit. Nevertheless, there are some common aspects that are distinctive of conventional benchmarks that might be sufficiently relevant to be considered in architectural design. Strikingly, we also found that most database engines, independently of aspects such as workload or database size, exhibit highly uniform behavior. Finally, we show that different data-base engines make highly distinctive demands on the memory hierarchy, some being more stringent than others.",Memory hierarchy; big-data; NoSQL; cache hierarchy; benchmark characterization

However, due to the inaccurate measurement of some acceleration sensors, people who love martial arts are deeply troubled and unable to find an excellent acceleration sensor specifically for energy consumption detection of human martial arts. The development of this sensor is imminent, which is of great significance for the comparative study of energy consumption measurement of human martial arts in our country. In this study, 160 students aged 11-14 years were selected, and the subjects were divided into normal body mass group and abnormal body mass group. Of the 96 male adolescents, 32 were obese body mass, which was determined as male abnormal body mass Group; 64 male adolescents were normal body weight and male normal body weight group; female 64 adolescents were normal body weight and set as female normal body mass group. Using a built-in accelerometer and a mobile phone three-dimensional accelerometer, the subjects were subjected to a 3-8 km/h human martial arts exercise load test (each speed is continuously performed for 5 min). The two acceleration sensors collectively assess the accuracy of the prediction of the use of force in human martial arts experiments. The average power consumption of human art exercises uses a frequency of 60 times/min, 90 times/min and 120 times/min compared to two acceleration sensors. Test results show that the data points for the mobile accelerator eraser are scattered, and the distance between the data varies. The data points of the three-dimensional acceleration sensor are more concentrated and present a certain trend. The use of three-dimensional acceleration sensors to measure martial arts can fully reflect the energy consumption of human activities, and achieve an energy consumption measurement accuracy of more than 94%.",Built-in acceleration sensor of mobile phone; Three-dimensional acceleration sensor; Energy consumption; Comparative experiment; Human martial arts

In this paper, we propose MEG, a Memory-and Energyefficient Garbled circuit evaluation mechanism. MEG utilizes batch data transmission and multi-threading to reduce memory and energy consumption. We implement MEG on an Android smartphone and compare its performance and energy consumption with state-of-the-art techniques using two garbled circuits of widely different sizes (AES-128 and 256-bit edit distance). Our results show that, compared with "" plain"" garbled circuit evaluation, MEG decreases memory consumption by more than 90%. When compared with current pipelined garbled circuit evaluation techniques, MEG's energy usage was 42% lower for AES-128 and 23% lower for EDT-256. Furthermore, our multi-thread implementation of MEG decreased circuit evaluation time by up to 56.7% for AES-128, and by up to 13.5% for EDT-256, compared with state-of-the-art pipelining techniques.",Security; side-channel attacks

1712,Laser Micromachining of Bone as a Tool for Studying Bone Marrow Biology,"Christa Haase,Dmitry Richter,Charles P Lin,Christa Haase,Dmitry Richter,Charles P Lin","The bone marrow (BM) has traditionally been a difficult tissue to access because it is embedded deep within the bone matrix. It is home to the hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) that give rise to all blood cells in the body. It is also the site of origin for malignant blood cells such as leukemia and multiple myeloma, as well as a frequent site of metastasis for many solid tumors including prostate and breast cancer. The following chapter describes how laser micromachining of bone can be used to improve both optical and physical access to the BM. For example, laser thinning of the overlying bone can improve optical access, enabling deeper imaging into the BM as well as enhancing optical resolution by reducing scattering and aberration. Laser micromachining can also be used to provide physical access into the BM by creating access ports for micropipette insertion and delivery of cells to precise locations in the BM, as well as for the extraction of BM cells and interstitial fluid, all under image guidance. This chapter provides a detailed protocol for installing a laser-micromachining capability for users with an existing multiphoton microscope. Additionally, we briefly outline how such a system improves the optical resolution during imaging as well as its potential use to study injury response.",Hematopoietic stem cell; Intravital microscopy; Leukemia; Plasma-mediated laser ablation; Stem cell transplantation.

Use of substances of potential abuse has historically been a contraindication to HT. Decriminalization of cannabis, increasing cannabis use, clinician biases, and lack of consensus for evaluating patients with heart failure who use cannabis all have the potential to exacerbate racial and ethnic and regional disparities in HT listing and organ allocation. Here' we review pertinent pre-HT and post-HT considerations related to cannabis use' and relative attitudes between opiates and cannabis are offered for context. We conclude with identifying unmet research needs pertaining to the use of cannabis in HT that can inform a standardized evaluation process.",cannabis; contraindications; heart failure; heart transplantation; illicit drugs.

Translation invariance enables CNNs to detect features regardless of their position in the scene. However, in some domains, like geospatial, not all locations are exactly equal. In this work, we propose localized convolutional neural networks that enable convolutional architectures to learn local features in addition to the global ones. We investigate their instantiations in the form of learnable inputs, local weights, and a more general form. They can be added to any convolutional layers, easily end-to-end trained, introduce minimal additional complexity, and let CNNs retain most of their benefits to the extent that they are needed. In this work we address spatio-temporal prediction: test the effectiveness of our methods on a synthetic benchmark dataset and tackle three real-world wind prediction datasets. For one of them, we propose a method to spatially order the unordered data. We compare the recent state-of-the-art spatio-temporal prediction models on the same data. Models that use convolutional layers can be and are extended with our localizations. In all these cases our extensions improve the results, and thus often the state-of-the-art.

1716,Robust Biopotential Acquisition via a Distributed Multi-Channel FM-ADC,"Warchall, Julian; Theilmann, Paul; Ouyang, Yuxuan; Garudadri, Harinath; Mercier, Patrick P.","This contribution presents an active electrode system for biopotential acquisition using a distributed multi-channel FM-modulated analog front-end and ADC architecture. Each electrode captures one biopotential signal and converts to a frequency modulated signal using a VCO tuned to a unique frequency. Each electrode then buffers its output onto a shared analog line that aggregates all of the FM-modulated channels. This aggregation results in rugged, wearable form factor by eliminating wire clutter of traditional systems. A gateway integrated circuit then digitizes the composite FM signal and transmits for further processing. The coding gain due to bandwidth expansion of FM provides a large usable dynamic range (DR) and the single ADC for multiple channels results in significant power savings. Finally, the use of FM signals between the transducers and ADC provides resilience to motion and EMI artifacts. The system is implemented in 65 nm silicon using two distinct 1 mm(2) chip designs. Six-channel operation is demonstrated using FM channels with center frequencies around 15 MHz and the system achieves a usable DR of over 100 dB, while achieving figure of merit competitive with state of the art prior works using traditional approaches.",Electrodes; Frequency modulation; Dynamic range; Frequency division multiplexing; Electromagnetic interference; Wires; Motion artifacts; Active electrode; ADC; biopotential acquisition; ExG; EM; wearable electronics

In order to understand the role played by the multiband electronic structure and the degree of two-dimensionality, we have investigated the electronic properties of exfoliated flakes of FeSe by reducing their thickness. Based on magnetotransport and Hall resistivity measurements, we assess the mobility spectrum that suggests an unusual asymmetry between the mobilities of the electrons and holes, with the electron carriers becoming localized inside the nematic phase. Quantum oscillations in magnetic fields up to 38 T indicate the presence of a hole-like quasiparticle with a lighter effective mass and a quantum scattering time three times shorter, as compared with bulk FeSe. The observed localization of negative charge carriers by reducing dimensionality can be driven by orbitally dependent correlation effects, enhanced interband spin fluctuations, or a Lifshitz-like transition, which affect mainly the electron bands. The electronic localization leads to a fragile two-dimensional superconductivity in thin flakes of FeSe, in contrast to the two-dimensional high-[Formula: see text] induced with electron doping via dosing or using a suitable interface.",Fermi surface; magnetotransport; quantum oscillations; thin flakes; unconventional superconductors.
1719,From demand response to transactive energy: state of the art,"Chen, Sijie; Liu, Chen-Ching","This paper reviews the state of the art of research and industry practice on demand response and the new methodology of transactive energy. Demand response programs incentivize consumers to align their demand with power supply conditions, enhancing power system reliability and economic operation. The design of demand response programs, performance of pilot projects and programs, consumer behaviors, and barriers are discussed. Transactive energy is a variant and a generalized form of demand response in that it manages both the supply and demand sides. It is intended for a changing environment with an increasing number of distributed resources and intelligent devices. It utilizes the flexibility of various generation/load resources to maintain a dynamic balance of supply and demand. These distributed resources are controlled by their owners. However, the design of transaction mechanisms should align the individual behaviors with the interests of the entire system. Transactive energy features real-time, autonomous, and decentralized decision making. The transition from demand response to transactive energy is also discussed.",Demand response; Incentive-based program; Price-based program; Direct load control; Transactive energy

1721,A Fast Iterative Method for Removing Impulsive Noise From Sparse Signals,"Sadrizadeh, Sahar; Zarmehi, Nematollah; Kangarshahi, Ehsan Asadi; Abin, Hamidreza; Marvasti, Farokh","In this paper, we propose a new method to reconstruct a signal corrupted by noise where both signal and noise are sparse but in different domains. The main contribution of our algorithm is its low complexity; it has much lower run-time than most other algorithms. The reconstruction quality of our algorithm is both objectively (in terms of PSNR and SSIM) and subjectively better or comparable to other state-of-the-art algorithms. We provide a cost function for our problem, present an iterative method to find its local minimum, and provide the analysis of the algorithm. As an application of this problem, we apply our algorithm for Salt-and-Pepper noise (SPN) and Random-Valued Impulsive Noise (RVIN) removal from images and compare our results with other notable algorithms in the literature. Furthermore, we apply our algorithm for removing clicks from audio signals.

Here we report that a modified metadynamics algorithm efficiently explores and samples low-energy regions of such high-dimensional landscapes. In the energy landscape for a model foam, our algorithm finds and descends meandering canyons in the landscape, which contain dense clusters of energy minima along their floors. Similar canyon structures in the energy landscapes of two model glass formers-hard sphere fluids and the Kob-Andersen glass-allow us to reach high densities and low energies, respectively. In the hard sphere system, fluid configurations are found to form continuous regions that cover the canyon floors up to densities well above the jamming transition. For the Kob-Andersen glass former, our technique samples low-energy states with modest computational effort, with the lowest energies found approaching the predicted Kauzmann limit.",energy landscape; glasses; hard spheres; metadynamics.
1723,Overcoming model bias for robust offline deep reinforcement learning,"Swazinna, Phillip; Udluft, Steffen; Runkler, Thomas","State-of-the-art reinforcement learning algorithms mostly rely on being allowed to directly interact with their environment to collect millions of observations. This makes it hard to transfer their success to industrial control problems, where simulations are often very costly or do not exist, and exploring in the real environment can potentially lead to catastrophic events. Recently developed, model-free, offline RL algorithms, can learn from a single dataset (containing limited exploration) by mitigating extrapolation error in value functions. However, the robustness of the training process is still comparatively low, a problem known from methods using value functions. To improve robustness and stability of the learning process, we use dynamics models to assess policy performance instead of value functions, resulting in MOOSE (MOdel-based Offline policy Search with Ensembles), an algorithm which ensures low model bias by keeping the policy within the support of the data. We compare MOOSE with state-of-the-art model-free, offline RL algorithms BRAC, BEAR and BCQ on the Industrial Benchmark and MuJoCo continuous control tasks in terms of robust performance, and find that MOOSE outperforms its model-free counterparts in almost all considered cases, often even by far.",Reinforcement learning; Offline RL; Real world applications; Robust RL; Batch-constrained RL; Industrial benchmark
1724,A Spatially Separable Attention Mechanism for Massive MIMO CSI Feedback,"Mourya, Sharan; Amuru, SaiDhiraj; Kuchi, Kiran Kumar","Channel State Information (CSI) Feedback plays a crucial role in achieving higher gains through beamforming. However, for a massive MIMO system, this feedback overhead is huge and grows linearly with the number of antennas. To reduce the feedback overhead several compressive sensing (CS) techniques were implemented in recent years but these techniques are often iterative and are computationally complex to realize in power-constrained user equipment (UE). Hence, a data-based deep learning approach took over in these recent years introducing a variety of neural networks for CSI compression. Specifically, transformer-based networks have been shown to achieve state-of-the-art performance. However, the multi-head attention operation, which is at the core of transformers, is computationally complex making transformers difficult to implement on a UE. In this letter, we present a lightweight transformer named STNet which uses a spatially separable attention mechanism that is significantly less complex than the traditional full-attention. Equipped with this, STNet outperformed state-of-the-art models in some scenarios with approximately 1/10(th )of the resources.",Transformers; Correlation; Massive MIMO; Decoding; Computational modeling; Convolutional neural networks; Sparse matrices; STNet; CSI feedback; transformers; self-attention; massive MIMO; TransNet; CSIFormer; CLNet
1725,SIFT Matching by Context Exposed,"Bellavia, Fabio","This paper investigates how to step up local image descriptor matching by exploiting matching context information. Two main contexts are identified, originated respectively from the descriptor space and from the keypoint space. The former is generally used to design the actual matching strategy while the latter to filter matches according to the local spatial consistency. On this basis, a new matching strategy and a novel local spatial filter, named respectively blob matching and Delaunay Triangulation Matching (DTM) are devised. Blob matching provides a general matching framework by merging together several strategies, including rank-based pre-filtering as well as many-to-many and symmetric matching, enabling to achieve a global improvement upon each individual strategy. DTM alternates between Delaunay triangulation contractions and expansions to figure out and adjust keypoint neighborhood consistency. Experimental evaluation shows that DTM is comparable or better than the state-of-the-art in terms of matching accuracy and robustness. Evaluation is carried out according to a new benchmark devised for analyzing the matching pipeline in terms of correct correspondences on both planar and non-planar scenes, including several state-of-the-art methods as well as the common SIFT matching approach for reference. This evaluation can be of assistance for future research in this field.",Delaunay triangulation; image context; keypoint matching; local image descriptors; local spatial filters; RANSAC; SIFT
1726,MR Image Denoising and Super-Resolution Using Regularized Reverse Diffusion,"Chung, Hyungjin; Lee, Eun Sun; Ye, Jong Chul","Patient scans from MRI often suffer from noise, which hampers the diagnostic capability of such images. As a method to mitigate such artifacts, denoising is largely studied both within the medical imaging community and beyond the community as a general subject. However, recent deep neural network-based approaches mostly rely on the minimum mean squared error (MMSE) estimates, which tend to produce a blurred output. Moreover, such models suffer when deployed in real-world situations: out-of-distribution data, and complex noise distributions that deviate from the usual parametric noise models. In this work, we propose a new denoising method based on score-based reverse diffusion sampling, which overcomes all the aforementioned drawbacks. Our network, trained only with coronal knee scans, excels even on out-of-distribution in vivo liver MRI data, contaminated with a complex mixture of noise. Even more, we propose a method to enhance the resolution of the denoised image with the same network. With extensive experiments, we show that our method establishes state-of-the-art performance while having desirable properties which prior MMSE denoisers did not have: flexibly choosing the extent of denoising, and quantifying uncertainty.",Noise reduction; Noise measurement; Magnetic resonance imaging; Mathematical models; Training; Diffusion processes; Numerical models; Diffusion model; stochastic contraction; denoising; MRI

Using animal tissue samples of known collection and formation dates for calibration, we determine the age of ivory samples from four ivory seizures made by law enforcement agencies between 2017 and 2019. The 14C measurements from these seizures show that most ivory in the illegal wildlife trade is from animals from recent poaching activities.

1728,SBERT-WK: A Sentence Embedding Method by Dissecting BERT-Based Word Models,"Wang, Bin; Kuo, C. -C. Jay","Sentence embedding is an important research topic in natural language processing (NLP) since it can transfer knowledge to downstream tasks. Meanwhile, a contextualized word representation, called BERT, achieves the state-of-the-art performance in quite a few NLP tasks. Yet, it is an open problem to generate a high quality sentence representation from BERT-based word models. It was shown in previous study that different layers of BERT capture different linguistic properties. This allows us to fuse information across layers to find better sentence representations. In this work, we study the layer-wise pattern of the word representation of deep contextualized models. Then, we propose a new sentence embedding method by dissecting BERT-based word models through geometric analysis of the space spanned by the word representation. It is called the SBERT-WK method. No further training is required in SBERT-WK. We evaluate SBERT-WK on semantic textual similarity and downstream supervised tasks. Furthermore, ten sentence-level probing tasks are presented for detailed linguistic analysis. Experiments show that SBERT-WK achieves the state-of-the-art performance.

Methods: A retrospective case-control study was performed comparing patients who had a simultaneous IOC ± ABS with LC at index admission with those who had delayed LC in the treatment of AGP. 74 patients were included in this study from January 2016 to October 2018. All patients who underwent LC for AGP were included in a prospective database with 1 year follow-up. Results: 30 (40.5%) patients underwent simultaneous IOC ± ABS with LC, 11 of these required ABS insertion. 2 (6.7%) patients also underwent magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP). No patients underwent endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). No patients were readmitted with AGP or symptomatic gallbladder. Mean length of total hospital admission was 10.1 days. 44 (59.5%) patients underwent delayed LC. Of this cohort, 7 (15.9%) patients underwent ERCP and 19 (43.2%) underwent MRCP. In total, there were 19 (43.2%) readmissions in this group with pancreatitis or symptomatic gallbladder. Mean length of total hospital admission was 13 days. Conclusions: In our pilot study we demonstrated that performing simultaneous IOC ± ABS with LC is a feasible option in the secondary care setting. Using this surgical technique, we have demonstrated a reduction in readmissions with AGP and symptomatic gallbladder while also reducing the number of CBD investigations required. Using simultaneous IOC ± ABS with LC reduced the mean total length of stay in hospital.",cholangiogram; cholecystectomy; choledocholithiasis; gallstone; laparoscopic; pancreatitis.
1730,Elemental fingerprinting of Kenya Rift Valley ochre deposits for provenance studies of rock art and archaeological pigments,"Zipkin, Andrew M.; Ambrose, Stanley H.; Hanchar, John M.; Piccoli, Philip M.; Brooks, Alison S.; Anthony, Elizabeth Y.","The Kenya Rift Valley contains many ochre sources that are currently used by indigenous peoples for adornment, rituals, and art. Ochre pigments occur in rock art and archaeological sites spanning over 250,000 years. Chemical analysis for provenience of geological sources is the first step in the process of reconstructing provenance of archaeological artifacts for cultural heritage, archaeological, and paleo-anthropological research. Development of an ochre source chemical composition database can facilitate reconstruction of social interaction networks and cultural heritage conservation efforts in this region. Techniques such as Laser Ablation-Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (LA-ICPMS) and Instrumental Neutron Activation Analysis (INAA) are often used for compositional analysis and sourcing of ferruginous mineral pigments. Sourcing has proven challenging due to the diverse range of rocks and minerals that are classified as red and yellow ochres, and the diverse processes that induce variation in composition, including modes of formation, sedimentary transport of parent materials, and diagenesis. Attribution of samples to specific sources is possible only when variation within sources is less than differences between sources (the Provenience Postulate). Here we present the results of a study using LA-ICPMS to determine inter-and intra-source geochemical variations for ten ochre sources associated with three large volcanic centers in the central Rift Valley of Kenya. Our results show that differences in chemical composition among sources are greater than variation within sources, both at the scale of large volcanic centers and of individual ochre outcrops within these centers. Clear differentiation of source chemical fingerprints at local and regional scales satisfies the Provenience Postulate, and suggests that provenance studies of ochre artifacts, residues, and rock art in Kenya will be feasible.

Hyperspectral unmixing aims at extracting these endmembers and corresponding fractional abundances from the hyperspectral image (HSI) data. With the availability of spectral libraries, semi-supervised unmixing which estimates the abundance from given endmember matrix, have become more and more popular. General semi-supervised methods take advantage of the sparsity constraint on the abundance matrix and consider the pixels as independent trials. However, the spatial information for example the correlation between pixels often cannot be taken into consideration. In this paper, we derive a semi-supervised hyperspectral image unmixing algorithm which handles both spectral and spatial prior efficiently using matrix factorization. The abundance matrix is recast as a multiplication of two variables, in which the spectral and spatial priors are captured respectively. Numerical tests in both simulated and real datasets show that compared to state-of-the-art unmixing algorithms, the proposed spectral-spatial factorization method has lower computation cost, better unmixing results, and is more robust to regularization parameter selection.",Hyperspectral imaging; Sparse matrices; Libraries; Sensors; Minimization; Signal processing algorithms; Art; Hyperspectral unmixing; sparse unmixing; spectral-spatial factorization

However, it is a challenging problem because real-time surveillance videos are typically affected by a variety of adverse environmental effects. In this work, we propose a novel surveillance framework, called a unifocal motion tracking surveillance system (UMTSS), for multi-object tracking in real-time videos. The proposed UMTSS combines two significant steps. First, a Faster-RCNN with inception-v2 model is employed here to detect multi-objects efficiently in each video frame. Then, a unifocal feature-based KLT (Kanade-Lucas-Tomasi) method is proposed for tracking objects across the video frames based on region proposals generated by the object detector in the previous phase. Also, we have proposed a new tracking parameter, called dynamic tracking accuracy (DTA), to quantify the performance of the tracking algorithms. The performance of our UMTSS has been evaluated on five standard crowd video databases, namely CrowdHuman, PETS, UCSD, AGORASET and CRCV, and compared with state-of-the-art methods in terms of different qualitative and quantitative measures.

In this article, lattice structures have been exploited to develop an efficient PP system. The proposed scheme is not only efficient in computation as compared to the state-of-the-art but also provides a high degree of security against quantum attacks. Rigorous security and privacy analyses of the proposed scheme have been provided along with a concrete set of parameters to achieve 128-b and 256-b security. Performance analysis shows that the scheme is at least five orders faster than the Paillier schemes and at least twice as faster than the existing randomization technique at 128-b security.

In particular, recent methods based on deep learning have exhibited high accuracies. However, various existing state-of-the-art methods based on deep learning show different accuracies depending on the database and environment. Accordingly, different deep learning models need to be used in image classification studies according to the database, environment, and research field. This study investigated a technique to increase the accuracy of the existing deep learning-based models. The proposed method was applied to various existing state-of-the-art methods. In the proposed method, a convolution neural network (CNN) is trained using the classification activation map (CAM) to focus on specific areas in the input image. The CAM image is used as the ground-truth image. Furthermore, the concept of the CAM-based cate-gorical adversarial network (CAM-CAN), in which the CNN is trained based on a generative adversarial network, is proposed in this paper. An action recognition experiment was performed using the self-collected Dongguk thermal image database (DTh-DB) and open database, and the results revealed that the accuracies of the existing state-of-the-art methods significantly increased after applying the proposed method. For instance, the accuracies obtained using the DTh-DB, TPR, PPV, ACC, and F1 with the conventional DenseNet201 model were 80.14%, 75.28%, 96.0%, and 75.91%, respectively.

Both scattering and quantum noise (for three different noise levels) were introduced to create noisy projections that simulate low-dose examinations. The results presented here (for both noiseless and noisy data sets) point to the facts that, as opposed to a filtered back-projection algorithm, the quality of the reconstructions produced by the ART methods does not suffer from the increase in the cone-beam angle and it is more robust in the presence of noise.

1738,Estimating A Reference Standard Segmentation With Spatially Varying Performance Parameters: Local MAP STAPLE,"Commowick, Olivier; Akhondi-Asl, Alireza; Warfield, Simon K.","We present a new algorithm, called local MAP STAPLE, to estimate from a set of multi-label segmentations both a reference standard segmentation and spatially varying performance parameters. It is based on a sliding window technique to estimate the segmentation and the segmentation performance parameters for each input segmentation. In order to allow for optimal fusion from the small amount of data in each local region, and to account for the possibility of labels not being observed in a local region of some (or all) input segmentations, we introduce prior probabilities for the local performance parameters through a new maximum a posteriori formulation of STAPLE. Further, we propose an expression to compute confidence intervals in the estimated local performance parameters. We carried out several experiments with local MAP STAPLE to characterize its performance and value for local segmentation evaluation. First, with simulated segmentations with known reference standard segmentation and spatially varying performance, we show that local MAP STAPLE performs better than both STAPLE and majority voting. Then we present evaluations with data sets from clinical applications. These experiments demonstrate that spatial adaptivity in segmentation performance is an important property to capture. We compared the local MAP STAPLE segmentations to STAPLE, and to previously published fusion techniques and demonstrate the superiority of local MAP STAPLE over other state-of-the-art algorithms.",Label fusion; performance evaluation; reference standard; segmentation; simultaneous truth and performance level estimation (STAPLE)
1739,Decreasing contact resistance in proton-exchange membrane fuel cells with metal bipolar plates,"Netwall, Christopher J.; Gould, Benjamin D.; Rodgers, Joseph A.; Nasello, Nicholas J.; Swider-Lyons, Karen E.","Ohmic, or (IR)-R-2, losses occur in electrochemical devices, such as proton -exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) due to the resistance of materials and the contact resistance between the electrochemical active area, the gas diffusion and current collector materials. Such losses must be lessened to maximize the conversion of chemical energy to electricity rather than heat. We probe how to decrease the contact resistance in PEMFCs with metal bipolar plates with state-of-the-art membrane electrode assemblies, specifically Au/TiO2-coated titanium bipolar plates (BPPs), gas diffusion layers with microporous layers (GDLs with MPLs), and catalyst-coated membranes (CCMs) comprising a 15-mu m-thick proton-exchange membranes. Through in situ tests of a model system, we find that the system resistance decreases after a compression break-in cycle and then remains low subsequently by keeping the stack assembly compressed at >1 MPa. Ex situ tests show that the surface roughness of the BPPs also affects contact resistance with the GDLs. After accounting for the bulk resistance of the cell constituents (BPPs, GDLs, MPLs and CCMs), we conclude that in a state-of-the-art PEMFC, the contact resistances between the materials contribute 55% of the total (IR)-R-2 losses, and thus dominate the ohmic loss contributions.

1740,Amyloid-β induced astrocytosis and astrocyte death: Implication of FoxO3a-Bim-caspase3 death signaling,"Pampa Saha,Subhas Chandra Biswas,Pampa Saha,Subhas Chandra Biswas","Astrocytes, the main element of the homeostatic system in the brain, are affected in various neurological conditions including Alzheimer's disease (AD). A common astrocytic reaction in pathological state is known as astrocytosis which is characterized by a specific change in astrocyte shape due to cytoskeletal remodeling, cytokine secretion and cellular proliferation. Astrocytes also undergo apoptosis in various neurological conditions or in response to toxic insults. AD is pathologically characterized by progressive deposition of amyloid-β (Aβ) in senile plaques, intraneuronal neurofibrillary tangles, synaptic dysfunction and neuron death. Astrocytosis and astrocyte death have been reported in AD brain as well as in response to Aβ in vitro. However, how astrocytes undergo both proliferation and death in response to Aβ remains elusive. In this study, we used primary cultures of cortical astrocytes and exposed them to various doses of oligomeric Aβ. We found that cultured astrocytes proliferate and manifest all signs of astrocytosis at a low dose of Aβ. However, at high dose of Aβ the activated astrocytes undergo apoptosis. Astrocytosis was also noticed in vivo in response to Aβ in the rat brain. Next, we investigated the mechanism of astrocyte apoptosis in response to a high dose of Aβ. We found that death of astrocyte induced by Aβ requires a set of molecules that are instrumental for neuron death in response to Aβ. It involves activation of Forkhead transcription factor Foxo3a, induction of its pro-apoptotic target Bim and activation of its downstream molecule, caspase3. Hence, this study demonstrates that the concentration of Aβ decides whether astrocytes do proliferate or undergo apoptosis via a mechanism that is required for neuron death.",Alzheimer's disease; Apoptosis; Astrogliosis; Glia.

The oldest rock art and artifacts in Caatinga are dated from 10,000 BP. Besides that, there is no register of ancient activities in soils in Caatinga. Four pedons were taken, described and classified in sites with a high number of artifacts littering the surface and/or rock art. Five more pedons were described to represent soil without anthropic influence. Soils are shallow and transition between horizons was predominantly clear or abrupt. Anthrosols in Caatinga have value and chroma similar to the anthropic horizons described in Amazonian dark earths. The pedons are strongly acid to slightly alkaline and predominantly have base saturation above 50% in all horizons. Anthrosols in Caatinga have up to 6 and 544 times, respectively, more soil organic carbon and phosphorus compared to adjacent soils without anthropic influence. Besides illite and kaolinite, apatite and calcite compose the clay and silt fractions and confirm the human influence in soil formation.

1742,TRUE ORTHOPHOTO GENERATION BASED ON UNMANNED AERIAL VEHICLE IMAGES USING RECONSTRUCTED EDGE POINTS,"Ebrahimikia, Mojdeh; Hosseininaveh, Ali","After considering state-of-the-art algorithms, this paper presents a novel method for generating true orthophotos from unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) images of urban areas. The procedure consists of four steps: 2D edge detection in building regions, 3D edge graph generation, digital surface model (DSM) modification and, finally, true orthophoto and orthomosaic generation. The main contribution of this paper is concerned with the first two steps, in which deep-learning approaches are used to identift the structural edges of the buildings and the estimated 3D edge points are added to the point cloud for DSM modification. Running the proposed method as well as four state-of-the-art methods on two different datasets demonstrates that the proposed method outperforms the existing orthophoto improvement methods by up to 50% in the first dataset and by 70% in the second dataset by reducing true orthophoto distortion in the structured edges of the buildings.",building detection; curved edges; DSM modification; sawtooth effects; True orthophoto; UAV images

The aim of the MeSPeLA study was to explore the understanding, experience and expectations of Polish medical students in terms of e-learning. Questionnaire containing open-ended and closed questions supplemented by focus group discussion was validated and performed among 204 medical students in Poland before COVID-19 pandemia. Several domains: understanding of e-learning definitions; students' experience, preferences, expectations and perceptions of e-learning usefulness, advantages and disadvantages were addressed. The qualitative data were analyzed using an inductive approach. 46.0% of students chose a communication-oriented definition as the most appropriate. 7.4% claimed not to have any experience with e-learning. 76.8% of respondents indicated they had contact with e-learning. The main reported e-learning advantages were time saving and easier time management. The most common drawback was limited social interactions. The acceptance of the usage of e-learning was high. Medical undergraduates in Poland regardless of the year of studies, gender or choice of future specialization showed positive attitudes towards e-learning. Students with advanced IT skills showed a better understanding of the e-learning definition and perceived e-learning to be a more useful approach. The expectations and perceptions about e-learning in Polish medical schools seems similar to some extent to that in Western European and the United States so we can be more confident about applying some lessons from these research to Poland or other post-communist countries.

1744,Prior-Free Respiratory Motion Estimation in Rotational Angiography,"Unberath, Mathias; Taubmann, Oliver; Aichert, Andre; Achenbach, Stephan; Maier, Andreas","Rotational coronary angiography using C-arm angiography systems enables intra-procedural 3-D imaging that is considered beneficial for diagnostic assessment and interventional guidance. Despite previous efforts, rotational angiography was not yet successfully established in clinical practice for coronary artery procedures due to challenges associated with substantial intra-scan respiratory and cardiac motion. While gating handles cardiac motion during reconstruction, respiratory motion requires compensation. State-of-the-art algorithms rely on 3-D/2-D registration that requires an uncompensated reconstruction of sufficient quality. To overcome this limitation, we investigate two prior-free respiratory motion estimation methods based on the optimization of: 1) epipolar consistency conditions (ECCs) and 2) a task-based auto-focus measure (AFM). The methods assess redundancies in projection images or impose favorable properties of 3-D space, respectively, and are used to estimate the respiratory motion of the coronary arteries within rotational angiograms. We evaluate our algorithms on the publicly available Cavarev benchmark and on clinical data. We quantify reductions in error due to respiratory motion compensation using a dedicated reconstruction domain metric. Moreover, we study the improvements in image quality when using an analytic and a novel temporal total variation regularized algebraic reconstruction algorithm. We observed substantial improvement in all figures of merit compared with the uncompensated case. Improvements in image quality presented as a reduction of double edges, blurring, and noise. Benefits of the proposed corrections were notable even in cases suffering little corruption from respiratory motion, translating to an improvement in the vessel sharpness of (6.08 +/- 4.46)% and (14.7 +/- 8.80)% when the ECC-based and the AFM-based compensation were applied. On the Cavarev data, our motion compensation approach exhibits an improvement of (27.6 +/- 7.5)% and (97.0 +/- 17.7)% when the ECC and AFM were used, respectively. At the time of writing, our method based on AFM is leading the Cavarev scoreboard. Both motion estimation strategies are purely image-based and accurately estimate the displacements of the coronary arteries due to respiration. While current evidence suggests the superior performance of AFM, future work will further investigate the use of ECC in the context of angiography as they solely rely on geometric calibration and projection-domain images.",Consistency conditions; auto-focus; digital subtraction angiography; total variation; tomography

Our studies investigated the role of AUTS2 in neuronal differentiation and discovered that AUTS2, together with WDR68 and SKI, forms a novel protein complex (AWS) specifically in neuronal progenitors and promotes neuronal differentiation through inhibiting BMP signaling. Genomic and biochemical analyses demonstrated that the AWS complex achieves this effect by recruiting the CUL4 E3 ubiquitin ligase complex to mediate poly-ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation of phosphorylated SMAD1/5/9. Furthermore, using primary cortical neurons, we observed aberrant BMP signaling and dysregulated expression of neuronal genes upon manipulating the AWS complex, indicating that the AWS-CUL4-BMP axis plays a role in regulating neuronal lineage specification in vivo. Thus, our findings uncover a sophisticated cellular signaling network mobilized by a prominent NDD risk factor, presenting multiple potential therapeutic targets for NDD.",Autism susceptibility candidate 2 (AUTS2); BMP signaling; Embryonic stem cell; Neurodevelopmental disorders; Neuronal differentiation; SKI.

The mare was referred to a veterinary hospital with a laceration over the body of the right mandible. Radiographic assessment revealed two mesial fracture lines involving the second premolar tooth and a ventrally displaced bone fragment. The mare was treated under general anesthesia and the fracture was corrected using open reduction and plate fixation. A 3.5 mm narrow 15-hole locking compression plate with seven locking screws were used in a bridge form. Cerclage wire was also used to anchor the incisor teeth to the second and third premolar teeth. The cerclage wire and incisor teeth were covered with polymethylmethacrylate to prevent implant failure and avoid injury to the oral mucosa. Implants were removed 55 days after surgery and the mare was discharged from hospital five days later. The mare returned for cerclage wire removal after 90 days and was allowed to resume exercise thereafter. The combination of two surgical techniques, proper implant choice and appropriate postoperative management, including use of pelleted feed, contributed to successful bone healing and return to function.",LCP; bone trauma; cerclage wiring; diastema; horse.

Furthermore, the racial gap in genetic databases could lead to a higher likelihood of harm for non-white patients. We also review recent legal analyses indicating it is unlikely that an individual who sues for restitution would be successful, especially in the absence of evidence of lab negligence.

However, an extensive set of benchmark experiments is currently lacking, i.e. deep learning models tested on the same dataset, with a common and consistent set of metrics, and in the same hardware. In this work, we use the BigEarthNet Sentinel-2 multispectral dataset to benchmark for the first time different state-of-the-art deep learning models for the multi-label, multi-class LULC image classification problem, contributing with an exhaustive zoo of 62 trained models. Our benchmark includes standard Convolution Neural Network architectures, as well as non-convolutional methods, such as Multi-Layer Perceptrons and Vision Transformers. We put to the test EfficientNets and Wide Residual Networks (WRN) architectures, and leverage classification accuracy, training time and inference rate. Furthermore, we propose to use the EfficientNet framework for the compound scaling of a lightweight WRN, by varying network depth, width, and input data resolution. Enhanced with an Efficient Channel Attention mechanism, our scaled lightweight model emerged as the new state-of-the-art. It achieves 4.5% higher averaged F-Score classification accuracy for all 19 LULC classes compared to a standard ResNet50 baseline model, with an order of magnitude less trainable parameters. We provide access to all trained models, along with our code for distributed training on multiple GPU nodes. This model zoo of pre-trained encoders can be used for transfer learning and rapid prototyping in different remote sensing tasks that use Sentinel-2 data, instead of exploiting backbone models trained with data from a different domain, e.g., from ImageNet. We validate their suitability for transfer learning in different datasets of diverse volumes.

In Austria, where HPV vaccination is free for children, the vaccination rate nevertheless remains insufficient for herd immunity against HPV. Using a cross-sectional survey of parents (N = 334) in the state of Tyrol, Austria, we examined parents' reasons for rejecting children's HPV vaccination and key predictors of vaccination intention for their children, including knowledge about HPV, attitude toward vaccination, sources of information about the HPV vaccine, socioeconomic factors, and HPV vaccination intention. Data analyzed using descriptive statistics and logistic regression modeling revealed an overall 81.9% acceptance rate of HPV vaccination. The most common reasons for vaccine hesitancy were a fear of side effects, a perceived lack of information, and the perception that children are too young to be vaccinated. A high level of knowledge about HPV was significantly associated with vaccine acceptance for female but not male children. Negative attitude toward vaccination was significantly related to lower vaccine acceptance, and parents who reported informing themselves about HPV vaccination from online sources were less likely to accept vaccination. Such results call for more educational measures to reduce misinformation about HPV vaccination and thereby reduce the fear of its side effects and promote early vaccination. More information is also needed to improve parents' attitude toward and their knowledge about vaccination, the dissemination of which should focus on the benefits of vaccines for children of both sexes.",Austria; HPV; HPV vaccination; vaccine; vaccine acceptance; vaccine hesitancy; vaccine intention.
1754,Clustering Data of Mixed Categorical and Numerical Type With Unsupervised Feature Learning,"Lam, Dao; Wei, Mingzhen; Wunsch, Donald","Mixed-type categorical and numerical data are a challenge in many applications. This general area of mixed-type data is among the frontier areas, where computational intelligence approaches are often brittle compared with the capabilities of living creatures. In this paper, unsupervised feature learning (UFL) is applied to the mixed-type data to achieve a sparse representation, which makes it easier for clustering algorithms to separate the data. Unlike other UFL methods that work with homogeneous data, such as image and video data, the presented UFL works with the mixed-type data using fuzzy adaptive resonance theory (ART). UFL with fuzzy ART (UFLA) obtains a better clustering result by removing the differences in treating categorical and numeric features. The advantages of doing this are demonstrated with several real world data sets with ground truth, including heart disease, teaching assistant evaluation, and credit approval. The approach is also demonstrated on noisy, mixed-type petroleum industry data. UFLA is compared with several alternative methods. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time UFL has been extended to accomplish the fusion of mixed data types.",Clustering; unsupervised feature learning; mixed-type data; fuzzy ART

The primary security requirements in a vehicular network are vehicle authentication, message integrity, and privacy preservation. Most of the existing state-of-the-art security schemes heavily relied on infrastructural entities such as roadside units and trusted authorities to achieve authentication. Typically, frequent authentication involving infrastructural entities increases communication overhead. Besides, the existing solutions assume the usage of ideal tamper-proof devices for storing sensitive data, which is prone to physical and cloning attacks. In this context, we present a Physically Unclonable Function based Lightweight Authentication Scheme with privacy preservation for vehicle-to-vehicle communication in the vehicular network. Physically unclonable function adds an extra layer of security from cloning and physical attacks. The proposed method uses a two-tier approach consisting of trusted authority and vehicles for achieving authentication using lightweight bitwise XOR operations and one-way hash functions. The proposed scheme reduces the burden on infrastructural entities by performing authentication through vehicle-to-vehicle communication. Compared with state-of-the-art schemes, the proposed scheme's security and performance analysis demonstrates its effectiveness in meeting various security requirements while ensuring resilience against various known attacks and competitive communication and computation cost.",VANET; Conditional privacy-preserving; PUF; Authentication scheme; V2V communication; Lightweight authentication

Here, we develop single-crystal conductive black titanium (Ti4 O7 ) nanosheets (NSs) as a new precious metal carrier based on sacrificial hard templates and ultrasonic-assisted peeling, and deposit Pt clusters on Ti4 O7 NSs induced by wetness impregnation under the irradiation of visible light (VI; 650 nm). Pt/Ti4 O7 NSs provide Ti3+ , Pt2+ , and Pt0+ continuous active sites for the ORR multielectron process, achieving synergy among them. The assistance of visible light not only makes a more uniform and smaller distribution of Pt nanoclusters, but also strengthens the charge transfer, thereby constructing a strong metal-support interaction interface. VI-Pt/Ti4 O7 NSs show superior initial oxidation potential and a mass activity of 1.61 A mg-1 Pt at a E1/2 =0.91 V, which is nine times higher than that of commercial Pt/C. This work provides an effective strategy for achieving high-value applications of titanium sub-oxides and further explores the enhanced interface in metals Tin O2n-1 by light radiation.","clusters; oxygen reduction reaction; photoinduction; single-crystal, titanium."
1761,Confidence Interval Constraint-Based Regularization Framework for PET Quantization,"Kucharczak, F.; Ben Bouallegue, F.; Strauss, O.; Mariano-Goulart, D.","In this paper, a new generic regularized reconstruction framework based on confidence interval constraints for tomographic reconstruction is presented. As opposed to usual state-of-the-art regularization methods that try to minimize a cost function expressed as the sum of a data-fitting term and a regularization term weighted by a scalar parameter, the proposed algorithm is a two-step process. The first step concentrates on finding a set of images that rely on the direct estimation of confidence intervals for each reconstructed value. Then, the second step uses confidence intervals as a constraint to choose the most appropriate candidate according to a regularization criterion. Two different constraints are proposed in this paper. The first one has the main advantage of strictly ensuring that the regularized solution will respect the interval-valued data-fitting constraint, thus preventing over-smoothing of the solution while offering interesting properties in terms of spatial and statistical bias/variance trade-off. Another regularization proposition based on the design of a smoother constraint also with appealing properties is proposed as an alternative. The competitiveness of the proposed framework is illustrated in comparison to other regularization schemes using analytical and GATE-based simulation and real PET acquisition.",Image reconstruction; positron emission tomography; confidence intervals; constrained regularization; total variation
1762,Recognizing Actions Through Action-Specific Person Detection,"Khan, Fahad Shahbaz; Xu, Jiaolong; van de Weijer, Joost; Bagdanov, Andrew D.; Anwer, Rao Muhammad; Lopez, Antonio M.","Action recognition in still images is a challenging problem in computer vision. To facilitate comparative evaluation independently of person detection, the standard evaluation protocol for action recognition uses an oracle person detector to obtain perfect bounding box information at both training and test time. The assumption is that, in practice, a general person detector will provide candidate bounding boxes for action recognition. In this paper, we argue that this paradigm is suboptimal and that action class labels should already be considered during the detection stage. Motivated by the observation that body pose is strongly conditioned on action class, we show that: 1) the existing state-of-the-art generic person detectors are not adequate for proposing candidate bounding boxes for action classification; 2) due to limited training examples, the direct training of action-specific person detectors is also inadequate; and 3) using only a small number of labeled action examples, the transfer learning is able to adapt an existing detector to propose higher quality bounding boxes for subsequent action classification. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to investigate transfer learning for the task of action-specific person detection in still images. We perform extensive experiments on two benchmark data sets: 1) Stanford-40 and 2) PASCAL VOC 2012. For the action detection task (i.e., both person localization and classification of the action performed), our approach outperforms methods based on general person detection by 5.7% mean average precision (MAP) on Stanford-40 and 2.1% MAP on PASCAL VOC 2012. Our approach also significantly outperforms the state of the art with a MAP of 45.4% on Stanford-40 and 31.4% on PASCAL VOC 2012. We also evaluate our action detection approach for the task of action classification (i.e., recognizing actions without localizing them). For this task, our approach, without using any ground-truth person localization at test time, outperforms on both data sets state-of-the-art methods, which do use person locations.",Action recognition; transfer learning; deep features
1763,A factorization approach for cone-beam reconstruction on a circular short-scan,"Dennerlein, Frank; Noo, Frederic; Schoendube, Harald; Lauritsch, Guenter; Hornegger, Joachim","In this paper, we introduce a new algorithm for 3-D image reconstruction from cone-beam (CB) projections acquired along a partial circular scan. Our algorithm is based on a novel, exact factorization of the initial 3-D reconstruction problem into a set of independent 2-D inversion problems, each of which corresponds to finding the object density on one, single plane. Any such 2-D inversion problem is solved numerically using a projected steepest descent iteration scheme. We present a numerical evaluation of our factorization algorithm using computer-simulated CB data, without and with noise, of the FORBILD head phantom and of a disk phantom. First, we study quantitatively the impact of the reconstruction parameters on the algorithm performance. Next, we present reconstruction results for visual assessment of the achievable image quality and provide, for comparison, results obtained with two other state-of-the-art reconstruction algorithms for the circular short-scan.",image reconstruction; X-ray tomography
1764,The Generalized Log-Ratio Transformation: Learning Shape and Adjacency Priors for Simultaneous Thigh Muscle Segmentation,"Andrews, Shawn; Hamarneh, Ghassan","We present a novel probabilistic shape representation that implicitly includes prior anatomical volume and adjacency information, termed the generalized log-ratio (GLR) representation. We demonstrate the usefulness of this representation in the task of thigh muscle segmentation. Analysis of the shapes and sizes of thigh muscles can lead to a better understanding of the effects of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), which often results in skeletal muscle weakness in lower limbs. However, segmenting these muscles from one another is difficult due to a lack of distinctive features and inter-muscular boundaries that are difficult to detect. We overcome these difficulties by building a shape model in the space of GLR representations. We remove pose variability from the model by employing a presegmentation-based alignment scheme. We also design a rotationally invariant random forest boundary detector that learns common appearances of the interface between muscles from training data. We combine the shape model and the boundary detector into a fully automatic globally optimal segmentation technique. Our segmentation technique produces a probabilistic segmentation that can be used to generate uncertainty information, which can be used to aid subsequent analysis. Our experiments on challenging 3D magnetic resonance imaging data sets show that the use of the GLR representation improves the segmentation accuracy, and yields an average Dice similarity coefficient of 0.808 +/- 0.074, comparable to other state-of-the-art thigh segmentation techniques.",COPD; edge Detection; muscle Segmentation; probabilistic Segmentation; statistical Shape Analysis; uncertainty
1765,The User Experience of an Immersive and Interactive Wall Exergame in Older Adults,"Néva Béraud-Peigné,Pauline Maillot,Alexandra Perrot,Néva Béraud-Peigné,Pauline Maillot,Alexandra Perrot","Exergames are promising options for modulating the effects of aging on physical and cognitive functions. A new-generation immersive and interactive wall exergame (I2WE) has emerged in recent years, offering users freedom of movement as well as greater and varied interactions with other players, the environment, and the system than traditional games (e.g., Wii™, Kinect). These features could improve the user experience (UX) and thus the engagement and benefits of the intervention for older people. The purpose of this study was to determine whether this kind of exergame could be an effective tool for multidomain training for the elderly. An exploratory study was conducted with 38 healthy older adults who tested a single exergame session to evaluate the UX and the perceived enjoyment, as well as the session's workload and intensity. The results show that I2WE generates moderate-to-high physical intensity, following recommendations for older people, while the perceived exertion is lower. Moreover, it creates a positive UX that correlates with high perceived enjoyment while producing a suitable session's workload. I2WE appears to be an effective tool to promote physical activity while concurrently stimulating cognition in older adults. The intrinsic characteristics (i.e., immersion, combined physical and cognitive activity, interactions, complex motor skills, playfulness, and variety of collective games) give this new type of exergame a promising future. Future studies should be conducted to investigate the effects of an I2WE program on the physical and cognitive functions of older adults.",Exergames; Older adults; Physical intensity; User experience; Workload.
1766,Towards better exploiting convolutional neural networks for remote sensing scene classification,"Nogueira, Keiller; Penatti, Otavio A. B.; dos Santos, Jefersson A.","We present an analysis of three possible strategies for exploiting the power of existing convolutional neural networks (ConvNets or CNNs) in different scenarios from the ones they were trained: full training, fine tuning, and using ConvNets as feature extractors. In many applications, especially including remote sensing, it is not feasible to fully design and train a new ConvNet, as this usually requires a considerable amount of labeled data and demands high computational costs. Therefore, it is important to understand how to better use existing ConvNets. We perform experiments with six popular ConvNets using three remote sensing datasets. We also compare ConvNets in each strategy with existing, descriptors and with state-of-the-art baselines. Results point that fine tuning tends to be the best performing strategy. In fact, using the features from the fine-tuned ConvNet with linear SVM obtains the best results. We also achieved state-of-the-art results for the three datasets used. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

1767,Structure-Aware Long Short-Term Memory Network for 3D Cephalometric Landmark Detection,"Chen, Runnan; Ma, Yuexin; Chen, Nenglun; Liu, Lingjie; Cui, Zhiming; Lin, Yanhong; Wang, Wenping","Detecting 3D landmarks on cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) is crucial to assessing and quantifying the anatomical abnormalities in 3D cephalometric analysis. However, the current methods are time-consuming and suffer from large biases in landmark localization, leading to unreliable diagnosis results. In this work, we propose a novel Structure-Aware Long Short-Term Memory framework (SA-LSTM) for efficient and accurate 3D landmark detection. To reduce the computational burden, SA-LSTM is designed in two stages. It first locates the coarse landmarks via heatmap regression on a down-sampled CBCT volume and then progressively refines landmarks by attentive offset regression using multi-resolution cropped patches. To boost accuracy, SA-LSTM captures global-local dependence among the cropping patches via self-attention. Specifically, a novel graph attention module implicitly encodes the landmark's global structure to rationalize the predicted position. Moreover, a novel attention-gated module recursively filters irrelevant local features and maintains high-confident local predictions for aggregating the final result. Experiments conducted on an in-house dataset and a public dataset show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving 1.64 mm and 2.37 mm average errors, respectively. Furthermore, our method is very efficient, taking only 0.5 seconds for inferring the whole CBCT volume of resolution 768 x 768 x 576.",CBCT; anatomical landmark detection; attention; LSTM
1768,Adaptive Image Enhancement Based on Guide Image and Fraction-Power Transformation for Wireless Capsule Endoscopy,"Long, Mingzhu; Li, Zhuo; Xie, Xiang; Li, Guolin; Wang, Zhihua","Good image quality of the wireless capsule endoscopy (WCE) is the key for doctors to diagnose gastrointestinal (GI) tract diseases. However, the poor illumination, limited performance of the camera in WCE, and complex environment in the GI tract usually result in low-quality endoscopic images. Existing image enhancement methods only use the information of the image itself or multiple images of the same scene to accomplish the enhancement. In this paper, we propose an adaptive image enhancement method based on guide image and fraction-power transformation. First, intensities of endoscopic images are analyzed to assess the illumination conditions. Second, images captured under poor illumination conditions are enhanced by a brand-new image enhancement method called adaptive guide image based enhancement (AGIE). AGIE enhances low-quality images by using the information of a good quality image of the similar scene. Otherwise, images are enhanced by the proposed adaptive fraction-power transformation. Experimental results show that the proposed method improves the average intensity of endoscopic images by 64.20% and the average local entropy by 31.25%, which outperforms the state-of-art methods.",Fraction-power transformation; guide image; histogram equalization; image enhancement; wireless capsule endoscopy

A high-resolution cryo-EM structure of gokushovirus ΦEC6098 was determined, and the atomic model was built de novo. Although gokushoviruses lack external scaffolding and spike proteins, which extensively interact with the ΦX174 capsid protein, the core of the ΦEC6098 coat protein (VP1) displayed a similar structure. There are, however, key differences. At each ΦEC6098 icosahedral 3-fold axis, a long insertion loop formed mushroom-like protrusions, which have been noted in lower-resolution gokushovirus structures. Hydrophobic interfaces at the bottom of these protrusions may confer stability to the capsid shell. In ΦX174, the N-terminus of the capsid protein resides directly atop the 3-fold axes of symmetry; however, the ΦEC6098 N-terminus stretched across the inner surface of the capsid shell, reaching nearly to the 5-fold axis of the neighboring pentamer. Thus, this extended N-terminus interconnected pentamers on the inside of the capsid shell, presumably promoting capsid assembly, a function performed by the ΦX174 external scaffolding protein. There were also key differences between the ΦX174-like DNA-binding J proteins and its ΦEC6098 homologue VP8. As seen with the J proteins, C-terminal VP8 residues were bound into a pocket within the major capsid protein; however, its N-terminal residues were disordered, likely due to flexibility. We show that the combined location and interaction of VP8's C-terminus and a portion of VP1's N-terminus are reminiscent of those seen with the ΦX174 and α3 J proteins. IMPORTANCE There is a dramatic structural and morphogenetic divide within the Microviridae. The well-studied ΦX174-like viruses have prominent spikes at their icosahedral vertices, which are absent in gokushoviruses. Instead, gokushovirus major coat proteins form extensive mushroom-like protrusions at the 3-fold axes of symmetry. In addition, gokushoviruses lack an external scaffolding protein, the more critical of the two ΦX174 assembly proteins, but retain an internal scaffolding protein. The ΦEC6098 virion suggests that key external scaffolding functions are likely performed by coat protein domains unique to gokushoviruses. Thus, within one family, different assembly paths have been taken, demonstrating how a two-scaffolding protein system can evolve into a one-scaffolding protein system, or vice versa.",DNA-binding protein; Microviridae; cryo-EM; gokushovirus; microvirus; mushroom spike.

We also present our co-designed, low power very large scale integration (VLSI) architecture for HMDS. The goal of HMDS is to enable the support of high quality video on low power mobile devices and low bit rate applications which typically use H.264/AVC baseline profile at levels 1-2. Our experiments use standard test sequences ranging from QCIF to high-definition 1280 x 720p video. The proposed VLSI architecture is prototyped as an field-programable gate array (FPGA)-based field programable system-on- chip. Our results show that HMDS on average has better rate-distortion performance and speedup, compared to previous state-of-the-art fast motion estimation algorithms, while its losses compared to full search motion estimation, are insignificant. Our prototyped architecture is more hardware-efficient than previous FPGA-based architectures in terms of power consumption, area, throughput, and memory utilization.

1772,P-PseudoLabel: Enhanced Pseudo-Labeling Framework With Network Pruning in Semi-Supervised Learning,"Ham, Gyeongdo; Cho, Yucheol; Lee, Jae-Hyeok; Kim, Daeshik","Semi-supervised learning (SSL) methods for classification tasks exhibit a significant performance gain because they combine regularization and pseudo-labeling methods. General pseudo-labeling methods only depend on the model's prediction when assigning pseudo-labels, but this approach often leads to the generation of incorrect pseudo-labels, due to the network being biased toward easy classes or to the presence of confusing samples in the training set, which further decreases model performance. To address this issue, we propose a novel pseudo-labeling framework that dramatically reduces the ambiguity of pseudo-labels for confusing samples in SSL. We operate our method, called Pruning for Pseudo-Label (P-PseudoLabel), using the Easy-to-Forget (ETF) Sample Finder, which compares the outputs of the model and the pruned model to identify confusing samples. Next, we perform negative learning using the confusing samples to decrease the risk of providing incorrect information and to improve performance. Our method achieves better performance than those of recent state-of-the-art SSL methods on the CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Mini-ImageNet datasets, and is on par with the state-of-the-art methods on SVHN and STL-10.",Predictive models; Computational modeling; Data models; Semi-supervised learning; Labeling; Task analysis; Supervised learning; Consistency regularization; network pruning; negative learning; pseudo labeling; semi-supervised learning

In this paper, we propose a new kernel function to estimate samples' local densities and propose a weighted neighborhood density estimation to increase the robustness to changes in the neighborhood size. We further propose a local kernel regression estimator and a hierarchical strategy for combining information from the multiple scale neighborhoods to refine anomaly factors of samples. We apply our general anomaly detection method to image saliency detection by regarding salient pixels in objects as anomalies to the background regions. Local density estimation in the visual feature space and kernel-based saliency score propagation in the image enable the assignment of similar saliency values to homogenous object regions. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that our anomaly detection methods overall outperform several state-of-art anomaly detection methods.

We establish the theoretical limits on the precision and confidence of proximity estimation for both technologies using the Cramer Rao Lower Bound (CRLB) and validate the theoretical foundations using empirical data gathered in diverse practical operating scenarios. We perform our empirical experiments at eight distances in three flat environments and one non-flat environment encompassing both Line of Sight (LOS) and Obstructed-LOS (OLOS) situations. We also analyze the effects of various postures (eight angles) of the person carrying the sensor, and four on-body locations of the sensor. To estimate the range with BLE RSSI, we use 14 features for training the Gradient Boosted Machines (GBM) learning algorithm and we compare the precision of results with those obtained from memoryless UWB TOA ranging algorithm. We show that the memoryless UWB TOA algorithm achieves 93.60% confidence, slightly outperforming the 92.85% confidence of the BLE RSSI with more complex GBM machine learning (ML) algorithm and the need for substantial training. The training process for the RSSI-based BLE social distance measurements involved 3000 measurements to create a training dataset for each scenario and post-processing of data to extract 14 features of RSSI, and the ML classification algorithm consumed 200 s of computational time.

Based on the history of its founding, its structure, and work, this article demonstrates that temporality played an essential role in the establishment of alternative bodies of knowledge. Contrary to the established model of linear scientific-technological progress, the aim was to return to bodies of knowledge and practices that had largely disappeared from the scientific canon of knowledge, but also from agricultural practice, in previous processes of forgetting and marginalization. This is exemplified by the so-called ""spade diagnosis,"" a method developed in the 1930s by soil biologists to assess arable soil.

Previous studies have confirmed the schizophrenia-related functional connectivity between the striatal and cortical regions. However, among these, few studies have attempted to determine the directional flow of the influence. In the present study, we used resting-state fMRI to explore the directed connectivity between the striatum and the cortical regions in schizophrenia. Employing a Granger causality analysis, we observed a significant failure of the directed inhibitory influence of the striatum on the default mode network (DMN) in schizophrenia. Furthermore, the reciprocal influence of the DMN on the striatum was also significantly reduced. These findings provide compelling evidence for a breakdown of the striatum-DMN loop in schizophrenia.

We report an in-depth structural analysis of Fe(III) heme-peptide complexes by a combination of UV/Vis, resonance Raman, and 2D-NMR spectroscopic methods. The experiments reveal insights both into the coordination to the central iron ion and into the spatial arrangement of the amino acid sequences interacting with protoporphyrin IX. Cysteine-based peptides display different heme-binding behavior as a result of the existence of ordered, partially ordered, and disordered conformations in the heme-unbound state. Thus, the heme-binding mode is clearly the consequence of the nature and flexibility of the residues surrounding the iron ion coordinating cysteine.

Methods: We used data collected from 2002 to 2018 on PWH receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART) enrolled in the Veterans Aging Cohort Study. Generalized estimating equations were used to estimate associations between self-reported past-year cannabis use and detectable viral load (>= 500 copies/mL), with and without adjustment for demographics, other substance use, and adherence. Results: Among 2515 participants, 97% were male, 66% were Black, the mean age was 50 years, and 33% had detectable HIV viral load at the first study visit. In unadjusted analyses, PWH with any past-year cannabis use had 21% higher odds of a detectable viral load than those with no past-year use (OR = 1.21; 95% CI, 1.07-1.37). However, there was no significant association between cannabis use and viral load after adjustment. Conclusions: Among PWH engaged in care and receiving ART, cannabis use is associated with decreased adherence in unadjusted analyses but does not appear to directly impact viral control.

To prevent the spread of antibiotic resistance, effective approaches to detect antimicrobial susceptibility in aquatic environments are highly desired. In this work, we adopt a metabolism-based bioorthogonal noncanonical amino acid tagging (BONCAT) method to detect, visualize, and quantify active antimicrobial-resistant bacteria in water samples by exploiting the differences in bacterial metabolic responses to antibiotics. The BONCAT approach can be applied to rapidly detect bacterial resistance to multiple antibiotics within 20 min of incubation, regardless of whether they act on proteins or DNA. In addition, the combination of BONCAT with the microscope enables the intuitive characterization of antibiotic-resistant bacteria in mixed systems at single-cell resolution. Furthermore, BONCAT coupled with flow cytometry exhibits good performance in determining bacterial resistance ratios to chloramphenicol and population heterogeneity in hospital wastewater samples. In addition, this approach is also effective in detecting antibiotic-resistant bacteria in natural water samples. Therefore, such a simple, fast, and efficient BONCAT-based approach will be valuable in monitoring the increase and spread of antibiotic resistance within natural and engineered aquatic environments.",antimicrobial resistance detection; aquatic environments; bioorthogonal noncanonical amino acid tagging; click reaction; fluorescence signals; metabolic activity.

Recovered ammonia can be used to produce ammonium sulfate (AS) for agricultural use, enabling the circular return of nitrogen as fertilizer to the food system. We investigate the cost and life cycle environmental impact of recovering ammonia from the sidestream of WWTPs for conversion to AS and compare it to AS production from the Haber Bosch process. We perform life cycle assessment (LCA) to investigate the environmental impact of AS fertilizer production by air-stripping ammonia from WWTP sidestreams at varying sidestream nitrogen concentrations. Techno-economic analysis (TEA) is performed to assess the break-even selling price of sidestream AS production at a WWTP in the City of Philadelphia.

Further reduction of greenhouse gas emissions is feasible by replacing fossil-based energy use in air-stripping process (82-98 % of net energy demand) with renewable sources. Also, a significant reduction in mineral depletion and improvement in human and ecosystem health are observed for the air-stripping approach. Furthermore, the break-even selling price for installing sidestream-based AS production at the Philadelphia's WWTP, considering capital and operating costs, is estimated at $0.046/kg AS (100 %), which is 92 % lower than the 2014 estimate of AS's average selling price at farms in the United States. We conclude that even with varying ammonia concentrations and high sidestream volume, air-stripping technology offers an environmentally and economically favorable option for implementing nitrogen recovery and simultaneous production of AS at WWTPs.",Ammonia stripping; Haber Bosch; Life cycle assessment; Nutrient recovery; Techno-economic analysis; Wastewater treatment.
1781,Steganalysis Steganalysis of adaptive multi-rate speech using statistical characteristics of pulse pairs,"Tian, Hui; Wu, Yanpeng; Chang, Chin-Chen; Huang, Yongfeng; Chen, Yonghong; Wang, Tian; Cai, Yiqiao; Liu, Jin","In this work, we concentrate on the steganalysis of adaptive multi-rate (AMR) speech, which widely exists in mobile Voice-over-IP services. Compared with the state of the arts, the most significant advantage of this work is that more accurate and more complete steganalysis features are presented. To avoid the impact of the possible interchange of pulse positions in one track, we characterize AMR speech exploiting the statistical properties of pulse pairs. Specifically, we employ the probability distributions of pulse pairs as long-term distribution features, extract Markov transition probabilities of pulse pairs as short-term invariant features, and adopt joint probability matrices of pulse pairs as features based on track-to-track correlations. Moreover, to optimize the feature set and reduce its dimension, we introduce a feature selection mechanism using adaptive boosting technique. Exploiting the well-selected features, we further present a steganalysis Of AMR speech based on support -vector-machine. The proposed method is evaluated with a good supply of AMR-encoded speech samples, and compared with the state-of-the-art methods. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can effectively detect the state-of-the-art steganography methods for AMR speech, and significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art steganalysis methods on detection accuracy, false-positive rate and false-negative rate for any given embedding rate or speech samples with any given length. In particular, the proposed method can provide accurate detecting results for the existing steganographic methods in a timely manner, and thereby be applied in the steganalysis scenario for real-time speech streams.",Steganalysis; Steganography; Adaptive multi-rate speech; Pulse-pair statistical characteristics; Adaptive boosting; Support vector machine

In this study, we applied a combinatorial approach for treating spinal cord injury involving neuroprotection and rehabilitation, exploiting cell transplantation and functional sensorimotor training to promote nerve regeneration and functional recovery. Here, we used a mouse model of thoracic contusive spinal cord injury to investigate whether the combination of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell transplantation and exercise training has a synergistic effect on functional restoration. Locomotor function was evaluated by the Basso Mouse Scale, horizontal ladder test, and footprint analysis. Magnetic resonance imaging, histological examination, transmission electron microscopy observation, immunofluorescence staining, and western blotting were performed 8 weeks after spinal cord injury to further explore the potential mechanism behind the synergistic repair effect. In vivo, the combination of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell transplantation and exercise showed a better therapeutic effect on motor function than the single treatments. Further investigations revealed that the combination of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell transplantation and exercise markedly reduced fibrotic scar tissue, protected neurons, and promoted axon and myelin protection. Additionally, the synergistic effects of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell transplantation and exercise on spinal cord injury recovery occurred via the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway. In vitro, experimental evidence from the PC12 cell line and primary cortical neuron culture also demonstrated that blocking of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway would aggravate neuronal damage. Thus, bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell transplantation combined with exercise training can effectively restore motor function after spinal cord injury by activating the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway.",axon growth; bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell; exercise training; mTOR; neuroprotection; neurotrophin; remyelination; scar formation; spinal cord injury; synaptic plasticity.

In this study, we evaluated PDO's ability to predict clinical response to gastrointestinal (GI) cancers.METHODSWe generated PDOs from primary and metastatic lesions of patients with GI cancers, including pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, colorectal adenocarcinoma, and cholangiocarcinoma. We compared PDO response with the observed clinical response for donor patients to the same treatments.RESULTSWe report an approximately 80% concordance rate between PDO and donor tumor response. Importantly, we found a profound influence of culture media on PDO phenotype, where we showed a significant difference in response to standard-of-care chemotherapies, distinct morphologies, and transcriptomes between media within the same PDO cultures.CONCLUSIONWhile we demonstrate a high concordance rate between donor tumor and PDO, these studies also showed the important role of culture media when using PDOs to inform treatment selection and predict response across a spectrum of GI cancers.TRIAL REGISTRATIONNot applicable.FUNDINGThe Joan F. & Richard A.

1785,Developing Automatic Multi-Objective Optimization Methods for Complex Actuators,"Chis, Radu; Vintan, Lucian","This paper presents the analysis and multiobjective optimization of a magnetic actuator. By varying just 8 parameters of the magnetic actuator's model the design space grows to more than 6 million configurations. Much more, the 8 objectives that must be optimized are conflicting and generate a huge objectives space, too. To cope with this complexity, we use advanced heuristic methods for Automatic Design Space Exploration. FADSE tool is one Automatic Design Space Exploration framework including different state of the art multi-objective meta-heuristics for solving NP-hard problems, which we used for the analysis and optimization of the COMSOL and MATLAB model of the magnetic actuator. We show that using a state of the art genetic multi-objective algorithm, response surface modelling methods and some machine learning techniques, the timing complexity of the design space exploration can be reduced, while still taking into consideration objective constraints so that various Pareto optimal configurations can be found. Using our developed approach, we were able to decrease the simulation time by at least a factor of 10, compared to a run that does all the simulations, while keeping prediction errors to around 1%.",actuators; computer aided engineering; machine learning; pareto optimization; response surface methodology
1786,A Novel Weakly Supervised Multitask Architecture for Retinal Lesions Segmentation on Fundus Images,"Playout, Clement; Duval, Renaud; Cheriet, Farida","Obtaining the complete segmentation map of retinal lesions is the first step toward an automated diagnosis tool for retinopathy that is interpretable in its decision-making. However, the limited availability of ground truth lesion detection maps at a pixel level restricts the ability of deep segmentation neural networks to generalize over large databases. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for training a convolutional multi-task architecture with supervised learning and reinforcing it with weakly supervised learning. The architecture is simultaneously trained for three tasks: segmentation of red lesions and of bright lesions, those two tasks done concurrently with lesion detection. In addition, we propose and discuss the advantages of a new preprocessing method that guarantees the color consistency between the raw image and its enhanced version. Our complete system produces segmentations of both red and bright lesions. The method is validated at the pixel level and per-image using four databases and a cross-validation strategy. When evaluated on the task of screening for the presence or absence of lesions on the Messidor image set, the proposed method achieves an area under the ROC curve of 0.839, comparable with the state-of-the-art.",Lesions; Retina; Image segmentation; Diseases; Training; Task analysis; Feature extraction; Computer-aided diagnostic; fundus imaging; lesions segmentations; retina; screening
1787,Generative Adversarial Networks and Perceptual Losses for Video Super-Resolution,"Lucas, Alice; Lopez-Tapia, Santiago; Molina, Rafael; Katsaggelos, Aggelos K.","Video super-resolution (VSR) has become one of the most critical problems in video processing. In the deep learning literature, recent works have shown the benefits of using adversarial-based and perceptual losses to improve the performance on various image restoration tasks; however, these have yet to be applied for video super-resolution. In this paper, we propose a generative adversarial network (GAN)-based formulation for VSR. We introduce a new generator network optimized for the VSR problem, named VSRResNet, along with new discriminator architecture to properly guide VSRResNet during the GAN training. We further enhance our VSR GAN formulation with two regularizers, a distance loss in feature-space and pixel-space, to obtain our final VSRResFeatGAN model. We show that pre-training our generator with the mean-squarederror loss only quantitatively surpasses the current state-of-theart VSR models. Finally, we employ the PercepDist metric to compare the state-of-the-art VSR models. We show that this metric more accurately evaluates the perceptual quality of SR solutions obtained from neural networks, compared with the commonly used PSNR/SSIM metrics. Finally, we show that our proposed model, the VSRResFeatGAN model, outperforms the current state-of-the-art SR models, both quantitatively and qualitatively.",Artificial neural networks; video signal processing; image resolution; image generation

We aimed to explore whether it has distinctive clinical characteristics and outcomes compared to other anatomic locations of extramedullary involvements. Methods: Multiple myeloma patients diagnosed at our institution from 2010 to 2020 were retrieved retrospectively. In total, 42 pairs of patients with and without extramedullary disease were enrolled, including 13 with myelomatous pleural effusion. The clinical and laboratory parameters were collected and compared between different groups. Prognostic effect of myelomatous pleural effusion was assessed in cox regression model and Kaplan-Meier curves. Results: Myelomatous pleural effusion patients presented a higher level of β2-microglobulin (P = .041), greater prevalence of multisites extramedullary lesions (69.2% vs 38.0%, P = .036) and International Staging System stage III (76.9% vs 44.8%, P = .016). Median overall survival was 60.6 months in patients without extramedullary disease versus 35.0 months in patients with extramedullary disease (P = .045). Notably, median overall survival was 13.0 months in myelomatous pleural effusion patients versus 37.0 months in other extramedullary disease patients with a significant difference (P = .029). Furtherly, multivariate analysis recognized myelomatous pleural effusion as an independent prognostic indicator (Hazard ratio: 2.669, 95% CI [1.132-6.293], P = .025). Conclusion: Myelomatous pleural effusion patients presented heavier tumor burden and worse outcomes than other extramedullary diseases.",adverse prognostic factor; extramedullary disease; heavy tumor burden; multiple myeloma; myelomatous pleural effusion.

Materials capable of storing and delivering CO are of great potential therapeutic value. Although CO-releasing molecules (CORMs) have been developed to deliver CO, the short CO duration of minutes to 2 h confines their practical use. In this study, partially reduced MIL-100(Fe) as a new CO-releasing nanoMOF was developed and used for sustained CO release and macrophage (MA) phenotypic polarization regulation. MIL-100(Fe) was synthesized and mildly annealed in vacuum for partial reduction. When the annealing temperature was lower than 250 °C, less Fe(II) present in MIL-100(Fe) and the subsequent CO adsorption and desorption profiles displayed typical features of physisorption. While it was annealed at 250 °C, it showed about 20% of Fe(III) was reduced, which resulted in chemisorption of CO due to the high coordination affinity of Fe(II) to CO. The loading amount of CO was increased, and the CO release was prolonged for about 24 h. Furthermore, the CO release from this nanoMOF could alter the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced macrophage from M1 to the alternative M2 phenotype and promoted the growth of endothelial cells (ECs) by paracrine regulation of MA. It can be envisioned as a promising CO-releasing solid for biomedical application.",CO carrier; CO release; MIL-100(Fe); inflammation; macrophage.

Advanced researches have led to a more accurate assessment of osteoporosis (OP) and have broadened the range of therapeutic approaches available to prevent osteoporotic fractures. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis is an evolutionary method that quantifies the majority of transcripts in individual cells at isoform resolution, paving the way for more detailed analyses of gene regulation in biology and medicine. We have extracted 19,102 cells and 4097 dynamical genes with significant expression changes. Several new subtypes of macrophages and differentially over-expressed genes were discovered in the trajectory of osteoclasts formation. The zinc finger protein 36, C3H type-like 1 (ZFP36L1) and defensin alpha 3 (DEFA3) were identified as novel bone metabolism-related genes. RETN-CAP1 was newly found to be involved in the interaction between osteoclasts and immunocytes, indicating that osteo-immunology microenvironment substantially contributed to the pathology of osteoporosis or osteopenia.

Despite multiple observational and genetic studies, the causal inference of diabetes (and associated risk factors) on those complications remains incomplete. In this review, we focused on type 2 diabetes, as the major form of diabetes, and investigated the evidence of causality provided by observational and genetic studies. We found that genetic studies based on Mendelian randomization provided consistent evidence of causal inference of type 2 diabetes on macrovascular complications; however, the evidence for causal inference on microvascular complications has been somewhat limited. We also noted high BMI could be causal for several diabetes complications, notable given high BMI is commonly upstream of type 2 diabetes and the recent calls to target weight loss more aggressively. We emphasize the need for further studies to identify type 2 diabetes components that mostly drive the risk of those complications. Even so, the genetic evidence summarized broadly concurs with the need for a multifactorial risk reduction approach in type 2 diabetes, including addressing excess adiposity.",genetics of type 2 diabetes; macrovascular disease; mendelian randomization; microvascular disease.
1793,Dense Steerable Filter CNNs for Exploiting Rotational Symmetry in Histology Images,"Graham, Simon; Epstein, David; Rajpoot, Nasir","Histology images are inherently symmetric under rotation, where each orientation is equally as likely to appear. However, this rotational symmetry is not widely utilised as prior knowledge in modern Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), resulting in data hungry models that learn independent features at each orientation. Allowing CNNs to be rotation-equivariant removes the necessity to learn this set of transformations from the data and instead frees up model capacity, allowing more discriminative features to be learned. This reduction in the number of required parameters also reduces the risk of overfitting. In this paper, we propose Dense Steerable Filter CNNs (DSF-CNNs) that use group convolutions with multiple rotated copies of each filter in a densely connected framework. Each filter is defined as a linear combination of steerable basis filters, enabling exact rotation and decreasing the number of trainable parameters compared to standard filters. We also provide the first in-depth comparison of different rotation-equivariant CNNs for histology image analysis and demonstrate the advantage of encoding rotational symmetry into modern architectures. We show that DSF-CNNs achieve state-of-the-art performance, with significantly fewer parameters, when applied to three different tasks in the area of computational pathology: breast tumour classification, colon gland segmentation and multi-tissue nuclear segmentation.",Image segmentation; Standards; Task analysis; Pathology; Harmonic analysis; Computer architecture; Machine learning; Rotation-equivariance; steerable filters; deep learning; computational pathology
1794,A Model of Population and Subject (MOPS) Intensities With Application to Multiple Sclerosis Lesion Segmentation,"Tomas-Fernandez, Xavier; Warfield, Simon K.","White matter (WM) lesions are thought to play an important role in multiple sclerosis (MS) disease burden. Recent work in the automated segmentation of white matter lesions from magnetic resonance imaging has utilized a model in which lesions are outliers in the distribution of tissue signal intensities across the entire brain of each patient. However, the sensitivity and specificity of lesion detection and segmentation with these approaches have been inadequate. In our analysis, we determined this is due to the substantial overlap between the whole brain signal intensity distribution of lesions and normal tissue. Inspired by the ability of experts to detect lesions based on their local signal intensity characteristics, we propose a new algorithm that achieves lesion and brain tissue segmentation through simultaneous estimation of a spatially global within-the-subject intensity distribution and a spatially local intensity distribution derived from a healthy reference population. We demonstrate that MS lesions can be segmented as outliers from this intensity model of population and subject. We carried out extensive experiments with both synthetic and clinical data, and compared the performance of our new algorithm to those of state-of-the art techniques. We found this new approach leads to a substantial improvement in the sensitivity and specificity of lesion detection and segmentation.",Lesions; magnetic resonance imaging; multiple sclerosis (MS); segmentation; tissue classification

Variations in the frequency and severity of diseases and in treatment effects among human subpopulation groups are common in many medical conditions. Unfortunately, the practices in terms of subpopulation labeling do not exhibit the level of rigor one would expect in biomedical research, especially when studying multifactorial diseases such as cancer or atherosclerosis. The reporting of population differences in clinical research is characterized by large disparities in practices, and fraught with methodological issues and inconsistencies. The actual designations such as ""Black"" or ""Asian"" refer to broad and heterogeneous groups, with a great discrepancy among countries. Moreover, the use of obsolete concepts such as ""Caucasian"" is unfortunate and imprecise. The use of adequate labeling to reflect the scientific hypothesis needs to be promoted. Furthermore, the use of ""race/ethnicity"" as a unique cause of human heterogeneity may distract from investigating other factors related to a medical condition, particularly if this label is employed as a proxy for cultural habits, diet, or environmental exposure. In addition, the wide range of opinions among researchers does not facilitate the attempts made for resolving this heterogeneity in labeling. ""Race,"" ""ethnicity,"" ""ancestry,"" ""geographical origin,"" and other similar concepts are saturated with meanings. Even if the feasibility of a global consensus on labeling seems difficult, geneticists, sociologists, anthropologists, and ethicists should help develop policies and practices for the biomedical field.",biomedical translational science; cultural diversity; ethnicity; genetic variation; racial groups.

Here, the authors identify zebrafish pld6 as a novel germline-specific gene by cross-analyzing different RNA sequencing results, and find that pld6 knockout mutants develop exclusively into infertile males. In pld6 mutants, GSPCs fail to differentiate and undergo apoptosis, leading to masculinization and infertility. Mitochondrial fusion in pld6-depleted GSPCs is severely impaired, and the mutants exhibit defects in piRNA biogenesis and transposon suppression.

In 2019, water samples were collected during the wet and dry periods from the three land-use zones at depths of 0-30 cm using a plankton net with 333 µm in mesh size. The water samples were digested via a wet peroxide oxidation process prior to the identification of microplastic morphology using a stereomicroscope. The polymer types of microplastic were analyzed using Fourier transform infrared spectrophotometry. Microplastic was found to range from 0.00 to 4.61 particles/m2 (0.34 ± 0.81 particles/m2) or 0.0 to 19.57 particles/m3 (1.44 ± 3.4 particles/m3). Furthermore, significantly high amounts of microplastics were found in samples from the community area. No microplastic was detected in the sample from the natural resource conservation area. The quantity of microplastic did not significantly differ between the sampling periods. Polymer types, including polyester, polypropylene, and polyethylene terephthalate, were identified in this study. The microplastics were predominantly small and were colored black or red. Microplastic with a fiber shape (93.8%) was observed. Besides the specific gravity of the microplastic and hydrological characteristics, the high concentration of microplastics found in samples from the community area (0.62 ± 0.79 particles/m2 or 2.63 ± 3.36 particles/m3) is likely related to the high human pressure. As microplastic contamination can impact aquatic animals and wetland ecosystems, appropriate control measures for human activities and plastic waste management are required.",Land use; Microplastic; Plastic polymer; Surface water; Wetland.

Each algorithm handles systems with feedforward and feedback coefficients allowing to compute high-complexity filtering operators. The final algorithm is linear in time and memory, exposes a high number of parallel tasks, and it is implemented on graphics processing units, i.e. GPUs. The key to the final algorithm is the derivation of closed-form formulas to combine both non-recursive and recursive linear filters, based on an efficient state-of-the-art block-based strategy. Applications to early vision are considered in this work, hence the GPU implementation runs on images computing an approximation of the Gaussian filter and its first and second derivatives.

This methanogen, designated strain CANT, is alkaliphilic, thermotolerant, with Gram-positive staining non-motile cells. Strain CANT grows autotrophically using hydrogen exclusively as an energy source and carbon dioxide as the sole carbon source (without the requirement of yeast extract or other organic compounds). It grows at 20-45 °C (optimum, 45 °C) and pH 7.3-9.7 (optimum, pH 9.0). NaCl is not required for growth (optimum 0 %) but is tolerated up to 1.5 %. It resists novobiocin, streptomycin and vancomycin but is inhibited by ampicillin and penicillin, among other antibiotics. The genome consists of a circular chromosome (2.2 Mb) containing 2126 predicted protein-encoding genes with a G+C content of 36.4 mol%.

1801,TnTViT-G: Transformer in Transformer Network for Guidance Super Resolution,"Mehri, Armin; Behjati, Parichehr; Sappa, Angel Domingo","Image Super Resolution is a potential approach that can improve the image quality of low-resolution optical sensors, leading to improved performance in various industrial applications. It is important to emphasize that most state-of-the-art super resolution algorithms often use a single channel of input data for training and inference. However, this practice ignores the fact that the cost of acquiring high-resolution images in various spectral domains can differ a lot from one another. In this paper, we attempt to exploit complementary information from a low-cost channel (visible image) to increase the image quality of an expensive channel (infrared image). We propose a dual stream Transformer-based super resolution approach that uses the visible image as a guide to super-resolve another spectral band image. To this end, we introduce Transformer in Transformer network for Guidance super resolution, named TnTViT-G, an efficient and effective method that extracts the features of input images via different streams and fuses them together at various stages. In addition, unlike other guidance super resolution approaches, TnTViT-G is not limited to a fixed upsample size and it can generate super-resolved images of any size. Extensive experiments on various datasets show that the proposed model outperforms other state-of-the-art super resolution approaches. TnTViT-G surpasses state-of-the-art methods by up to $0.19 \sim 2.3dB $ , while it is memory efficient.",Transformers; Superresolution; Image resolution; Feature extraction; Convolutional neural networks; Image reconstruction; Single image super resolution; guidance super resolution; transformers; convolutional neural network

R.; Morgan, Hywel; Tartagni, Marco","Lipid bilayer membrane (BLM) arrays are required for high throughput analysis, for example drug screening or advanced DNA sequencing. Complex microfluidic devices are being developed but these are restricted in terms of array size and structure or have integrated electronic sensing with limited noise performance. We present a compact and scalable multichannel electrophysiology platform based on a hybrid approach that combines integrated state-of-the-art microelectronics with low-cost disposable fluidics providing a platform for high-quality parallel single ion channel recording. Specifically, we have developed a new integrated circuit amplifier based on a novel noise cancellation scheme that eliminates flicker noise derived from devices under test and amplifiers. The system is demonstrated through the simultaneous recording of ion channel activity from eight bilayer membranes. The platform is scalable and could be extended to much larger array sizes, limited only by electronic data decimation and communication capabilities.",Bilayer lipid membrane; current amplifier; discrete-time amplifier; electrophysiology; ion channel recording; low noise; microfluidic device; parallel BLM recording; sensor array

However, evidence from general population samples is scarce. Moreover, whether decision-making is prospectively linked to mental health in youth in the general population and whether such associations are reciprocal have yet to be examined. The present study examined bidirectional associations between various aspects of affective decision-making and emotional and behavioural problems at ages 11 and 14 years in 13,366 members of the Millennium Cohort Study. Decision-making (delay aversion, deliberation time, quality of decision-making, risk adjustment, risk-taking) and emotional (emotional symptoms, peer problems) and behavioural (conduct problems, hyperactivity/inattention) problems were measured using the Cambridge Gambling Task and the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire, respectively. Results of cross-lagged panel models adjusted for confounding revealed a negative reciprocal association between hyperactivity and quality of decision-making but also positive reciprocal associations between conduct problems and delay aversion, and between peer problems and deliberation time. Emotional problems and peer problems predicted a decrease in risk-taking, conduct problems predicted an increase in risk-taking, and hyperactivity predicted an increase in delay aversion and deliberation time. Furthermore, hyperactivity and conduct problems predicted less risk adjustment, and risk adjustment predicted fewer peer problems. The results suggest that behavioural problems are prospectively linked to greater risk-taking and lower risk adjustment in adolescence. Moreover, adolescents with behavioural problems tend to make poorer decisions and be more delay-averse, but also poorer quality of decision-making and increased delay aversion are associated with more behavioural problems over time.",Behaviour problems; Decision-making; Emotional problems; Gambling task; Millennium Cohort Study; Reward sensitivity.
1804,Image Recovery based on Local and Nonlocal Regularizations,"Zhu, Jun; Chen, Changwei","Recently, a nonlocal low-rank regularization based compressive sensing approach (NLR) which exploits structured sparsity of similar patches has shown the state-of-the-art performance in image recovery. However, NLR cannot efficiently preserve local structures because it ignores the relationship between pixels. In addition, the surrogate logdet function used in NLR cannot well approximate the rank. In this paper, a novel approach based on local and nonlocal regularizations toward exploiting the sparse-gradient property and nonlocal low-rank property (SGLR) has been proposed. Weighted schatten-p norm and l (q) norm have been used as better non-convex surrogate functions for the rank and l0 norm. In addition, an efficient iterative algorithm is developed to solve the resulting recovery problem. The experimental results have demonstrated that SGLR outperforms existing state-of-the-art CS algorithms.",Compressive sensing; Nonlocal low-rank regularization; Total variation; Weighted schatten-p norm; Alternating direction methods of multipliers

Here, we discovered a new genus of anammox bacteria in a full-scale wastewater-treating biofilm system, tentatively named ""Candidatus Loosdrechtia aerotolerans"". Next to genes of all core anammox metabolisms, it encoded and transcribed genes involved in the dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium (DNRA), which coupled to oxidation of small organic acids, could be used to replenish ammonium and sustain their metabolism. Surprisingly, it uniquely harbored a new ferredoxin-dependent nitrate reductase, which has not yet been found in any other anammox genome and might confer a selective advantage to it in nitrate assimilation. Similar to many other microorganisms, superoxide dismutase and catalase related to oxidative stress resistance were encoded and transcribed by ""Ca. Loosdrechtia aerotolerans"". Interestingly, bilirubin oxidase (BOD), likely involved in oxygen resistance of anammox bacteria under fluctuating oxygen concentrations, was identified in ""Ca. Loosdrechtia aerotolerans"" and four Ca. Brocadia genomes, and its activity was demonstrated using purified heterologously expressed proteins. A following survey of oxygen-active proteins in anammox bacteria revealed the presence of other previously undetected oxygen defense systems. The novel cbb3-type cytochrome c oxidase and bifunctional catalase-peroxidase may confer a selective advantage to Ca. Kuenenia and Ca. Scalindua that face frequent changes in oxygen concentrations. The discovery of this new genus significantly broadens our understanding of the ecophysiology of anammox bacteria. Furthermore, the diverse oxygen tolerance strategies employed by distinct anammox bacteria advance our understanding of their niche adaptability and provide valuable insight for the operation of anammox-based wastewater treatment systems.",Anammox; Biofilm; New genus; Nitrate reduction; Oxygen tolerance.

During the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease, stimulatory factors continuously act on the microglia causing abnormal activation and unbalanced phenotypic changes; these events have become a significant and promising area of research. In this review, we summarize the effects of microglial polarization and crosstalk with other cells in the central nervous system in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. Our literature search found that phenotypic changes occur continuously in Alzheimer's disease and that microglia exhibit extensive crosstalk with astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, neurons, and penetrated peripheral innate immune cells via specific signaling pathways and cytokines. Collectively, unlike previous efforts to modulate microglial phenotypes at a single level, targeting the phenotypes of microglia and the crosstalk with other cells in the central nervous system may be more effective in reducing inflammation in the central nervous system in Alzheimer's disease. This would establish a theoretical basis for reducing neuronal death from central nervous system inflammation and provide an appropriate environment to promote neuronal regeneration in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.",Alzheimer’s disease; amyloid; biomarker; central nervous system; cytokines; diabetes; inflammation; microglia; neuroinflammation; phagocytosis; tau.

From April 2020 to April 2021, 135 hospitalized adult SLE patients completed the questionnaire including sociodemographic and disease-related data, Post-traumatic Growth Inventory (PTGI), Medical Coping Modes Questionnaire (MCMQ), Social Support Rating Scale (SSRS), Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), and Self-Perceived Burden Scale (SPBS). Descriptive analysis, pearson's correlation analysis, and forward multiple line regression analysis were used for analysis by SPSS 22.0. Results showed that, the mean PTGI score was 57.52 ± 20.82. Pearson correlation analysis showed that, complicated autoimmune hemolytic anemia (r = - 0.185), CD4 +/CD8 + (r = - 0.383), acceptance-resignation (r = - 0.185), poor PSQI (r = - 0.215), and depression (r = - 0.322) were negatively associated with total PTGI score; while the relationship with lupus nephritis (r = 0.247), confrontation (r = 0.313), avoidance (r = 0.379), and SSRS (r = 0.242) were positive (all P < 0.05). The total score of PTGI and its five sub-dimensions were not correlated with anxiety and self-perceived burden. Further, CD4 +/CD8 +, confrontation of MCMQ, and SSRS could explain 30.3% of the variance in total PTGI (F = 6.646, P < 0.01). In summary, Chinese adults with SLE experience moderate levels of PTG.

The outcome is a continuous map defined within the myocardium where not only current state-of-the-art measures of transmurality can be calculated, but also information on the location of nonviable tissue is preserved. The computation is done by means of a partial differential equation framework we have called multi-stencil streamline fast marching. Using it, the myocardial and scarred tissue thickness is simultaneously computed. Experimental results show that the proposed 3-D method allows for the computation of transmurality in myocardial regions where current 2-D methods are not able to as conceived, and it also provides more robust and accurate results in situations where the assumptions on which current 2-D methods are based-i.e., there is a visible endocardial contour and its corresponding epicardial points lie on the same slice-, are not met.",Fast marching; heart; myocardial viability; perfusion imaging; quantification and estimation; transmurality

Nevertheless, they also suf-fer from weaknesses since their optimal performance depends on massive amounts of training data and the tuning of an extended number of parameters. As a countermeasure, some deep-forest methods have been recently proposed, as efficient and low-scale solutions. Despite that, these approaches simply em-ploy label classification probabilities as induced features and primarily focus on traditional classification and regression tasks, leaving multi-output prediction under-explored. Moreover, recent work has demon-strated that tree-embeddings are highly representative, especially in structured output prediction. In this direction, we propose a novel deep tree-ensemble (DTE) model, where every layer enriches the origi-nal feature set with a representation learning component based on tree-embeddings. In this paper, we specifically focus on two structured output prediction tasks, namely multi-label classification and multi-target regression. We conducted experiments using multiple benchmark datasets and the obtained results confirm that our method provides superior results to state-of-the-art methods in both tasks. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

B.; Huang, Yunxiang; Chen, Xi; Luo, Dan","This study aimed to determine the change in mental health (depression and anxiety) among HIV-positive gay and bisexual men (GBM) one year after diagnosis and the disparities in trajectories of mental health between them. The potential factors contributing to the disparities were also investigated. This was a one-year follow-up study focusing on the mental health of newly diagnosed HIV-positive individuals. Participants rated their depression, anxiety, stress, and social support levels at baseline and one year later. Information on the utilization of mental healthcare and the initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART) after diagnosis was collected at one-year follow-up. A total of 171 and 87 HIV-positive gay and bisexual men, respectively, completed two-time points surveys in this study. The depressive and anxiety symptoms experienced by HIV-positive GBM improvement one year after diagnosis. These improvements tended to be smaller in gay participants. Other factors including mental health care utilization and ART status during the one-year follow-up period, changes in social stress scores and objective social support scores were also associated with the changes in depression and anxiety, and all these factors, except for change in objective support, were found to be statistically different between HIV-positive GBM. Special attention should be given to the mental health of HIV-positive gay men. Promoting HIV-positive gay men to assess to mental health services and ART may be important for these populations to improve mental health. Enhancing social support and reducing stress levels may also be necessary for the vulnerable HIV-positive sexual minority groups.",bisexual; gay; HIV; AIDS; depression; anxiety; longitudinal study
1812,Performance vs computational efficiency for optimizing single and dynamic MRFs: Setting the state of the art with primal-dual strategies,"Komodakis, Nikos; Tziritas, Georgios; Paragios, Nikos","In this paper we introduce a novel method to address minimization of static and dynamic MRFs. Our approach is based on principles from linear programming and, in particular, on primal-dual strategies. It generalizes prior state-of-the-art methods such as alpha-expansion, while it can also be used for efficiently minimizing NP-hard problems with complex pair-wise potential functions. Furthermore, it offers a substantial speedup - of a Magnitude 10 - over existing techniques, due to the fact that it exploits information coming not only from the original MRF problem, but also from a dual one. The proposed technique consists of recovering pair of solutions for the primal and the dual such that the gap between them is minimized. Therefore, it can also boost performance of dynamic MRFs, where one should expect that the new pair of primal-dual Solutions is closed to the previous one. Promising results in a number of applications, and theoretical, as well as numerical comparisons with the state of the art demonstrate the extreme potentials of this approach.(2) (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

1813,DCBT-Net: Training Deep Convolutional Neural Networks With Extremely Noisy Labels,"Olimov, Bekhzod; Kim, Jeonghong; Paul, Anand","Obtaining data with correct labels is crucial to attain the state-of-the-art performance of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models. However, labeling datasets is significantly time-consuming and expensive process because it requires expert knowledge in a particular domain. Therefore, real-life datasets often exhibit incorrect labels due to the involvement of nonexperts in the data-labeling process. Consequently, there are many cases of incorrectly labeled data in the wild. Although the issue of poorly labeled datasets has been studied, the existing methods are complex and difficult to reproduce. Thus, in this study, we proposed a simpler algorithm called ""Deep Clean Before Training Net"" (DCBT-Net) that is based on cleaning wrongly labeled data points using the information from eigenvalues of the Laplacian matrix obtained from similarities between the data samples. The cleaned data were trained using deep CNN (DCNN) to attain the state-of-the-art results. This system achieved better performance than the existing approaches. In conducted experiments, the performance of the DCBT-Net was tested on three commercially available datasets, namely, Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology (MNIST) database of handwritten digits, Canadian Institute for Advanced Research (CIFAR) and WebVision1000 datasets. The proposed method achieved better results when assessed using several evaluation metrics compared with the existing state-of-the-art methods. Specifically, the DCBT-Net attained an average 15%, 20%, and 3% increase in accuracy score using MNIST database, CIFAR-10 dataset, and WebVision dataset, respectively. Also, the proposed approach demonstrated better results in specificity, sensitivity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value evaluation metrics.",Training; Noise measurement; Data models; Computational modeling; Labeling; Convolutional neural networks; Neural networks; Clustering; deep convolutional neural networks; eigenvalues and eigenvectors; image classification; noisy (corrupted) labels

For experimental evaluation, we present a data generation framework for Wi-Fi as the signals of interest and the Bluetooth and microwave oven signals as the RFI. Experiments reveal that (i) the downscaled FRCNN model can achieve up to a mean average precision (mAP) of 0.8, significantly outperforming the state-of-the-art, (ii) feature extraction with the VGG-13 architecture gives the best mAP with pretrained weights and configured as trainable, (iii) for signal detection in real RF traces, when compared to training purely with synthetic RF data, a better mAP can be achieved by training with a mixture of synthetic and real RF traces or by finetuning the synthetically-trained weights with an additional round of training on a small amount of real RF traces, and (iv) the mAP performance decreases as the signal to noise ratio (SNR) is lowered.",Time-frequency analysis; Signal detection; Radio frequency; Wireless communication; Machine learning; Communication system security; Task analysis; Signal detection; time-frequency span estimation; short-time Fourier transform (STFT); deep learning; supervised learning

There were 360 participants (M age = 31.34, SD = 12.47, range 18-75) who completed the survey online. Participants were recruited through social media, websites, and MTurk. Higher levels of aggression proneness were related to higher levels of prejudice. Higher levels of education about issues that impact transgender people and prior contact with a transgender person were associated with less prejudice. In a multiple regression analysis, the strongest predictor of prejudice was education about transgender people and topics.

The state of the art and a comparison with earlier studies,"Sandahl, G; Sjogren, S","This study presents a general description of the state of the art of capital budgeting methods used by Swedish corporations. It is based on a questionnaire sent to 528 companies selected from 500 of the largest Swedish corporations and some from the O-list of companies. The response rate is 24.4%. The study shows that the public sector companies are most frequent users of discounted cash flow (DCF) methods. The payback method is the most used in all industries; also matters size of company. The use of the net present value method has increased over the years, although the use of DCF methods is generally unchanged. Value-based management models have been introduced in the listed companies. Another conclusion is that tradition is an important factor explaining the choice of capital budgeting method. Large companies within the manufacturing industry use DCF methods more often than other companies. In general, the companies seem unconcerned with the tax consequences of capital budgeting decisions. It would appear as if the public companies have not adopted capital budgeting practices supporting shareholder value increases. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Although vimentin is a cytoplasmic protein, it also exists in the extracellular matrix and at the cell surface. Previous studies have shown that vimentin may exert multiple physiological effects in different nervous system injuries and diseases. For example, the studies of vimentin in spinal cord injury and stroke mainly focus on the formation of reactive astrocytes. Reduced glial scar, increased axonal regeneration, and improved motor function have been noted after spinal cord injury in vimentin and glial fibrillary acidic protein knockout (GFAP-/-VIM-/-) mice. However, attenuated glial scar formation in post-stroke in GFAP-/- VIM-/- mice resulted in abnormal neuronal network restoration and worse neurological recovery. These opposite results have been attributed to the multiple roles of glial scar in different temporal and spatial conditions. In addition, extracellular vimentin may be a neurotrophic factor that promotes axonal extension by interaction with the insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor. In the pathogenesis of bacterial meningitis, cell surface vimentin is a meningitis facilitator, acting as a receptor of multiple pathogenic bacteria, including E. coli K1, Listeria monocytogenes, and group B streptococcus. Compared with wild type mice, VIM-/- mice are less susceptible to bacterial infection and exhibit a reduced inflammatory response, suggesting that vimentin is necessary to induce the pathogenesis of meningitis. Recently published literature showed that vimentin serves as a double-edged sword in the nervous system, regulating axonal regrowth, myelination, apoptosis, and neuroinflammation. This review aims to provide an overview of vimentin in spinal cord injury, stroke, bacterial meningitis, gliomas, and peripheral nerve injury and to discuss the potential therapeutic methods involving vimentin manipulation in improving axonal regeneration, alleviating infection, inhibiting brain tumor progression, and enhancing nerve myelination.",astrocytes; axonal regeneration; bacterial meningitis; glial scar; gliomas; nervous system diseases; peripheral nervous system injury; spinal cord injury; stroke; vimentin.

Currently, chemotherapy is one among the most important therapy modalities for patients with ESCC. However, resistance to chemotherapeutic drugs leads to limited treatment options and poor prognosis. In our study, the analysis of small RNA sequencing and digital gene expression (DGE) profiling was done to recognize the microRNAs (miRNAs) and key genes related with drug resistance in ESCC. It was noticed that the hsa-miRNA-140-3p (miR-140-3p) expression was considerably higher in drug-resistant cells than in sensitive cells. In addition, DGE identified target genes of miR-140-3p might perform key roles in ESCC. Furthermore, this work exhibited that miR-140-3p represents the nuclear transcription factor Y subunit alpha (NFYA) gene by targeting its 3'-untranslated regions. Such an interaction might influence the formation of the transcription factor NFY trimer, which in turn may inhibit the transcription of the multidrug resistance 1 gene and, ultimately, to multidrug resistance in ESCC. The inhibition of miR-140-3p decreased resistance to oxaliplatin in EC. Therefore, miR-140-3p may serve as a molecular marker for treatment response, efficacy, and prognosis of chemotherapy in ESCC patients.",Chemotherapy; Gene modulation; Spinal injury; Treatment.

To enable these paradigms, base stations are undergoing major overhaul with complex digital signal processing, reconfigurable multistage architectures, as well as wideband sensing capability. In this article, we focus on the low-complexity multiantenna BS receiver to accomplish ultrawideband angular sensing. The proposed receiver is based on novel reconfigurable and intelligent sub-Nyquist sampling architecture. Here, reconfigurability allows the receiver to select and digitize noncontiguous frequency bands, while online learning-based intelligence allows the receiver to learn spectrum statistics and choose the frequency bands for sensing in order to maximize the throughput. Unlike the existing approaches, we show that the proposed approach does not need any prior knowledge of spectrum statistics. The efficacy of the proposed approach over state-of-the-art approaches is validated via hardware complexity as well as simulation results. We show that the proposed approach offers lower hardware complexity and achieves up to 23% lower estimation error than existing state-of-the-art methods.",Sensors; Wideband; Receivers; Throughput; Hardware; Frequency-domain analysis; Direction of arrival (DOA); noncontiguous wideband spectrum sensing (WSS); online learning; reconfigurable multiantenna receiver; sub-Nyquist sampling (SNS)
1821,A Robust and Reliable Point Cloud Recognition Network Under Rigid Transformation,"Liu, Dongrui; Chen, Chuanchuan; Xu, Changqing; Cai, Qi; Chu, Lei; Wen, Fei; Qiu, Robert","Point cloud recognition is an essential task in industrial robotics and autonomous driving. Recently, several point cloud processing models have achieved state-of-the-art performances. However, these methods lack rotation robustness, and their performances degrade severely under random rotations, failing to extend to real-world scenarios with varying orientations. To this end, we propose a method named self-contour-based transformation (SCT), which can be flexibly integrated into various existing point cloud recognition models against arbitrary rotations. SCT provides efficient rotation and translation invariance by introducing contour-aware transformation (CAT), which linearly transforms the Cartesian coordinates of points to translation and rotation-invariant representations. We prove that CAT is a rotation- and translation-invariant transformation based on the theoretical analysis. Furthermore, the frame alignment module is proposed to enhance the discriminative feature extraction by capturing contours and transforming self-contour-based frames into intraclass frames. Extensive experimental results show that SCT outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches under arbitrary rotations in effectiveness and efficiency on synthetic and real-world benchmarks. Furthermore, the robustness and generality evaluations indicate that SCT is robust and is applicable to various point cloud processing models, which highlights the superiority of SCT in industrial applications.",Point cloud compression; Feature extraction; Three-dimensional displays; Convolution; Robustness; Task analysis; Perturbation methods; 3-D point clouds; classification; robustness; rotation and translation invariance; segmentation

Having observed that the state-of-the-art performance is still unsatisfactory, this paper provides a novel solution to the problem, with two-fold contributions: 1) considering the strong semantic correlation between the different full-body attributes, we propose a multi-task deep model that uses an element-wise multiplication layer to extract more comprehensive feature representations. In practice, this layer serves as a filter to remove irrelevant background features, and is particularly important to handle complex, cluttered data; and 2) we introduce a weighted-sum term to the loss function that not only relativizes the contribution of each task but also is crucial for performance improvement in multiple-attribute inference settings.

Solms) plant for the reduction of nitrogen and phosphorus pollutants from glass industry effluent (GIE) as batch mode phytoremediation experiments. For this, response surface methodology (RSM) and artificial neural networks (ANN) methods were adopted to evidence the optimization and prediction performances of E. crassipes for total Kjeldahl's nitrogen (TKN) and total phosphorus (TP) removal. The control parameters, i.e., GIE concentration (0, 50, and 100%) and plant density (1, 3, and 5 numbers) were used to optimize the best reduction conditions of TKN and TP. A quadratic model of RSM and feed-forward backpropagation algorithm-based logistic model (input layer: 2 neurons, hidden layer: 10 neurons, and output layer: 1 neuron) of ANN showed good fitness results for experimental optimization. Optimization results showed that maximum reduction of TKN (93.86%) and TP (87.43%) was achieved by using 60% of GIE concentration and nearly five plants. However, coefficient of determination (R2) values showed that ANN models (TKN: 0.9980; TP: 0.9899) were superior in terms of prediction performance as compared to RSM (TKN: 0.9888; TP: 0.9868). Therefore, the findings of this study concluded that E. crassipes can be effectively used to remediate nitrogen and phosphorus loads of GIE and minimize environmental hazards caused by its unsafe disposal.",Artificial neural network; Eichhornia crassipes; Glass industry effluent; Phytoremediation; Response surface method.

The proposed system robustly tracks people in an indoor environment and displays their predicted future footsteps in front of them in real-time. The system is composed of a video camera, a computer and a projector. There are three main modules: tracking, analysis and visualization. The tracking module extracts people as moving blobs by using an adaptive background subtraction algorithm. Then, the location and orientation of their next footsteps are predicted. The future footsteps are visualized by a high-paced continuous display of foot images in the predicted location to simulate the natural stepping of a person. To evaluate the performance, the proposed system was exhibited during a public art exhibition in an airport. People showed surprise, excitement, curiosity.

Various asset trading rules are proposed experimentally based on different technical analysis techniques. However, these kind of trading strategies are profitable, extracting new asset specific trading rules from vast historical data to increase total return and decrease the risk of portfolios is difficult for human experts. Recently, various deep reinforcement learning (DRL) methods are employed to learn the new trading rules for each asset. In this paper, a novel DRL model with various feature extraction modules is proposed. The effect of different input representations on the performance of the models is investigated and the performance of DRL-based models in different markets and asset situations is studied.

We previously reported aspartame production via combination of enzymatic and chemical methods. However, the productivity of the aspartame intermediate by SAET was approximately one-fifth that of l-alanyl-l-glutamine (Ala-Gln), whose production method has already been established. Here, to improve the enzymatic activity of SAET, we performed random mutagenesis in the gene encoding SAET and obtained 10 mutations that elevated the enzymatic activity (1.2- to 1.7-fold increase) relative to that of wild-type SAET. To further improve the activity, we performed mutagenesis to optimize the combination of the obtained mutations and finally selected one SAET variant with 10 amino acid substitutions (M35-4 SAET). An Escherichia coli strain overexpressing M35-4 SAET displayed a 5.7-fold higher activity than that of the wild-type SAET, which was almost equal to that of Ala-Gln by an E. coli strain overexpressing wild-type SAET. The Vmax value of M35-4 SAET was 2.0-fold greater, and its thermostability was higher than those of wild-type SAET. These results suggest that the obtained SAET variants contribute to improvement in aspartame production.",Sphingobacterium siyangensis; aspartame production; random mutagenesis; rational mutagenesis; α-amino acid ester acyl transferase.

In this contribution, an aptamer-embedded hierarchical DNA nanocluster (Apt-eNC) is constructed as an intelligent carrier for cancer-targeted drug delivery. Specifically, Apt-eNC is designed to have a built-in reserve pool in the interior cavity from which aptamers may move outward to function as needed. When surface aptamers are degraded, ones in reserve pool can move outward to offer the compensation, thereby magically preserving tumor-targeting performance in vivo. Even if withstanding extensive aptamer depletion, Apt-eNC displays a 115-fold enhanced cell targeting compared with traditional counterparts and at least 60-fold improved tumor accumulation. Moreover, one Apt-eNC accommodates 5670 chemotherapeutic agents. As such, when systemically administrated into HeLa tumor-bearing BALB/c nude mouse model, drug-loaded Apt-eNC significantly inhibits tumor growth without systemic toxicity, holding great promise for high precision therapy.",3D hierarchical DNA nanocluster; built-in reserve pool of aptamers; high precision cancer therapy; outward movement.

The major and fastest component, called non-photochemical quenching, occurs within the photosystem II antenna system by the action of two essential light-harvesting complex (LHC)-like proteins, photosystem II subunit S (PSBS) in plants and light-harvesting complex stress-related (LHCSR) in green algae and diatoms. In the evolutionary intermediate Physcomitrella patens, a moss, both gene products are active. These proteins, which are present in low amounts, are difficult to purify, preventing structural and functional analysis. Here, we report on the overexpression of the LHCSR1 protein from P. patens in the heterologous systems Nicotiana benthamiana and Nicotiana tabacum using transient and stable nuclear transformation. We show that the protein accumulated in both heterologous systems is in its mature form, localizes in the chloroplast thylakoid membranes, and is correctly folded with chlorophyll a and xanthophylls but without chlorophyll b, an essential chromophore for plants and algal LHC proteins. Finally, we show that recombinant LHCSR1 is active in quenching in vivo, implying that the recombinant protein obtained is a good material for future structural and functional studies.",LHCSR; NPQ; Physcomitrella; light-harvesting complex (antenna complex); photobiology; photosynthesis; photosynthetic pigment; recombinant protein expression; tobacco.

Recently, the connectional brain template (CBT) was introduced as a compact representation integrating a population of brain multigraphs, where two brain regions can have multiple connections, into a single graph. Given a population of brain multigraphs observed at a baseline timepoint t1, we aim to learn how to predict the evolution of the population CBT at follow-up timepoints t>t1. Such model will allow us to foresee the evolution of the connectivity patterns of healthy and disordered individuals at the population level. Here we present recurrent multigraph integrator network (ReMI-Net⋆) to forecast population templates at consecutive timepoints from a given single timepoint. In particular, we unprecedentedly design a graph neural network architecture to model the changes in the brain multigraph and identify the biomarkers that differentiate between the typical and atypical populations. Addressing such issues is of paramount importance in diagnosing neurodegenerative disorders at early stages and promoting new clinical studies based on the pinned-down biomarker brain regions or connectivities. In this paper, we demonstrate the design and use of the ReMI-Net⋆ model, which learns both the multigraph node level and time level dependencies concurrently. Thanks to its novel graph convolutional design and normalization layers, ReMI-Net⋆ predicts well-centered, discriminative, and topologically sound connectional templates over time. Additionally, the results show that our model outperforms all benchmarks and state-of-the-art methods by comparing and discovering the atypical connectivity alterations over time.

1833,Semantic Image Segmentation with Contextual Hierarchical Models,"Seyedhosseini, Mojtaba; Tasdizen, Tolga","Semantic segmentation is the problem of assigning an object label to each pixel. It unifies the image segmentation and object recognition problems. The importance of using contextual information in semantic segmentation frameworks has been widely realized in the field. We propose a contextual framework, called contextual hierarchical model (CHM), which learns contextual information in a hierarchical framework for semantic segmentation. At each level of the hierarchy, a classifier is trained based on downsampled input images and outputs of previous levels. Our model then incorporates the resulting multi-resolution contextual information into a classifier to segment the input image at original resolution. This training strategy allows for optimization of a joint posterior probability at multiple resolutions through the hierarchy. Contextual hierarchical model is purely based on the input image patches and does not make use of any fragments or shape examples. Hence, it is applicable to a variety of problems such as object segmentation and edge detection. We demonstrate that CHM performs at par with state-of-the-art on Stanford background and Weizmann horse datasets. It also outperforms state-of-the-art edge detection methods on NYU depth dataset and achieves state-of-the-art on Berkeley segmentation dataset (BSDS 500).",Semantic segmentation; image segmentation; edge detection; hierarchical models; membrane detection; connectome

Recently, the possibility that multiple enhancers are orchestrated in clusters of enhancers has been suggested. How these elements are arranged in the 3D space to control the activation of a specific promoter remains unclear. Our recent work revealed that the TGFβ pathway drives the assembly of enhancer clusters and precise gene activation during neurogenesis. We discovered that the TGFβ pathway coactivator JMJD3 was essential in maintaining these structures in the 3D space. To do that, JMJD3 required an intrinsically disordered region involved in forming phase-separated biomolecular condensates found in the enhancer clusters. Our data support the existence of a relationship between 3D-conformation of the chromatin, biomolecular condensates, and TGFβ-driven response during mammalian neurogenesis. In this review, we discuss how signaling (TGFβ), epigenetics (JMJD3), and biochemical properties (biomolecular condensates nucleation) are coordinated to modulate the genome structure to guarantee proper neural development. Moreover, we comment on the potential underlying mechanisms and implications of the enhancer-mediated regulation.

Herein, a ZnO nanoflowers (ZnONFs)-assisted DNAzyme-based electrochemical platform for INV- and GOx-dominated biosensing is proposed by the change of pH in microenvironment. In this strategy, INV can usually catalyze the dissolution of sucrose to generate glucose, and glucose is then consumed by GOx to produce H2O2 and gluconic acid, in which ZnONFs can be effectively etched into free Zn2+ ions. Subsequently, the released Zn2+ ions have a shearing action for Zn2+-specific DNAzyme, thus triggering hybridization chain reaction along with the imbedding of methylene blue. The excellent electrochemical signals illustrate the method can be employed well for testing sucrose, INV and GOx with a low detection limit (0.019 μM, 0.047 mU/mL and 0.012 mU/mL, respectively). Finally, a series of basic and advanced logic gates (YES, AND, INHIBIT, and AND-AND-INHIBIT) in the biological process are constructed with different logic inputs, providing a valuable platform for the establishment of advanced molecular devices for bioanalysis and clinical diagnostics.",DNAzyme; Electrochemical platform; Glucose oxidase; Invertase; Logic gate; ZnO nanoflowers.

One pathological hallmark of T2D is the toxic accumulation of human islet amyloid polypeptide (hIAPP) aggregates. Monomeric hIAPP is a hormone normally co-secreted with insulin. However, increased levels of hIAPP in prediabetic and diabetic patients can lead to the formation of hIAPP protofibrils, which are toxic to β cells. Current therapies fail to address hIAPP aggregation and current screening modalities do not detect it. Using a stabilizing capping protein, monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) can be developed against a previously nonisolatable form of hIAPP protofibrils, which are protofibril specific and do not engage monomeric hIAPP. Shown here are two candidate mAbs that can detect hIAPP protofibrils in serum and hIAPP deposits in pancreatic islets in a mouse model of rapidly progressing T2D. Treatment of diabetic mice with the mAbs delays disease progression and dramatically increases overall survival. These results demonstrate the potential for using novel hIAPP protofibril-specific mAbs as a diagnostic screening tool for early detection of T2D, as well as therapeutically to preserve β cell function and target one of the underlying pathological mechanisms of T2D.",amyloidosis; diabetes; monoclonal antibodies; therapeutics.

Several variant methods have been proposed for enhancing SAR images over the past decades. However, in recent studies, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been widely applied in SAR image despeckling because of their versatility in representation learning. Nonetheless, a fair number of textures of the images are still lost when despeckling using simple CNN structures. To solve this problem, an encoder-decoder architecture was previously proposed. Although this architecture extracts features on different scales and has been shown to yield state-of-the-art performance, it still learns representation locally, resulting in missing overall information of convolutional features. Therefore, we herein introduce a new method for SAR image despeckling (SAR-CAM), which improves the performance of an encoder-decoder CNN architecture by using various attention modules. Moreover, a context block is introduced at the minimum scale to capture multiscale information. The model is trained via a data-driven approach using the gradient descent algorithm with a combination of modified despeckling gain and total variation loss function.

It is found naturally and added to foods as a preservative and evaluated by health authorities as safe for use in foods. However, propionic acid has been reported in the literature to be associated with both health and disease. The purpose of this work is to better understand how propionic acid affects Drosophila melanogaster by examining some of the effects of this compound on the D. melanogaster hemocytes. D. melanogaster was chosen as a suitable in vivo model to detect potential risks of propionic acid (at five concentrations ranging from 0.1 to 10 mM) used as a food preservative. Toxicity, cellular immune response, intracellular oxidative stress (reactive oxygen species, ROS), gut damage, and DNA damage (via Comet assay) were the end-points evaluated. Significant genotoxic effects were detected in selected cell targets in a concentration dependent manner, especially at two highest concentrations (5 and 10 mM) of propionic acid. This study is the first study reporting genotoxicity data in the hemocytes of Drosophila larvae, emphasizing the importance of D. melanogaster as a model organism in investigating the different biological effects caused by the ingested food preservative product.",Comet assay; Drosophila melanogaster; cellular immune response; food preservative; genotoxicity; gut damage; hemocytes; oxidative stress; propionic acid.

Particularly, DenseNet that connects each layer to every other layer in a feed-forward fashion and has shown impressive performances in natural image classification tasks. We propose HyperDenseNet, a 3-D fully convolutional neural network that extends the definition of dense connectivity to multi-modal segmentation problems. Each imaging modality has a path, and dense connections occur not only between the pairs of layers within the same path but also between those across different paths. This contrasts with the existing multi-modal CNN approaches, in which modeling several modalities relies entirely on a single joint layer (or level of abstraction) for fusion, typically either at the input or at the output of the network. Therefore, the proposed network has total freedom to learn more complex combinations between the modalities, within and in-between all the levels of abstraction, which increases significantly the learning representation. We report extensive evaluations over two different and highly competitive multi-modal brain tissue segmentation challenges, iSEG 2017 and MRBrainS 2013, with the former focusing on six month infant data and the latter on adult images.

Specifically, with the generative adversarial network (GAN) as the building block, we enforce the cycle-consistency in terms of the Wasserstein distance to establish a nonlinear end-to-end mapping from noisy LR input images to denoised and deblurred HR outputs. We also include the joint constraints in the loss function to facilitate structural preservation. In this process, we incorporate deep convolutional neural network (CNN), residual learning, and network in network techniques for feature extraction and restoration. In contrast to the current trend of increasing network depth and complexity to boost the imaging performance, we apply a parallel ${1}\times {1}$ CNN to compress the output of the hidden layer and optimize the number of layers and the number of filters for each convolutional layer. The quantitative and qualitative evaluative results demonstrate that our proposed model is accurate, efficient and robust for super-resolution (SR) image restoration from noisy LR input images.

To understand the pathogenicity of P. noxius in herbaceous plants, we investigated 23 herbaceous weed and turfgrass species in 32 BRRD-infested sites in Taiwan and/or tested them by artificial inoculation. In the field survey, P. noxius was isolated from seven symptomless herbaceous species (i.e., Typhonium blumei, Paspalum conjugatum, Paspalum distichum, Oplismenus compositus, Bidens pilosa, Digitaria ciliaris, and Zoysia matrella). Potted plant inoculation assays suggested that P. noxius is able to infect Artemisia princeps, O. compositus, and Z. matrella but not Axonopus compressus, Eremochloa ophiuroides, Ophiopogon japonicus, or Cynodon dactylon. A. princeps plants wilted within 2 weeks postinoculation, but inoculated O. compositus and Z. matrella were asymptomatic, and P. noxius could be isolated from only inoculated sites. The colonization of P. noxius in the cortex and vascular cylinder of roots was visualized by paraffin sectioning and trypan blue staining of juvenile seedlings grown on water agar. To evaluate the effect of replantation for the remediation of BRRD-infested sites, P. noxius-inoculated wood strips were buried in soil with or without vegetation. After 4 weeks, P. noxius could be detected only in the bare soil group. For the control of BRRD, the herbaceous hosts should be removed around the diseased trees/stumps and non-host turfgrasses (e.g., A. compressus, E. ophiuroides, O. japonicus, or C. dactylon) planted to accelerate the degradation of P. noxius.",Koch's postulate; brown root rot disease; lignin; nonadapted pathogen; remediation; symptomless; turfgrass; weed.

Previously, we have demonstrated that broad-spectrum antibiotic exposure after TBI drastically alters the gut microbiota and modulates neuroinflammation, neurogenesis, and long-term fear memory. However, these data did not determine if the impact of antibiotic exposure on the brain's response to injury was mediated directly by antibiotics or indirectly via modulation of the gut microbiota. We designed two different approaches to address this knowledge gap. One was utilizing fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) from control and antibiotic-treated mice (treated with vancomycin, neomycin, ampicillin, and metronidazole [VNAM]) into germ-free (GF) mice prior to injury, and the other was exposing specific pathogen-free (SPF) mice to a 2-week period of antibiotics prior to injury but discontinuing antibiotics 72 h prior to injury. GF mice receiving FMT from VNAM-treated mice (GF-VNAM) demonstrated reduced gut bacterial alpha diversity and richness compared with GF mice receiving control FMT. At 7 days post-injury, GF-VNAM had increased microglial activation, reduced infiltration of T cells, and decreased neurogenesis. Similarly, SPF mice exposed to antibiotics prior to but not after injury demonstrated similar alterations in neuroinflammation and neurogenesis compared with control mice. These data support our hypothesis implicating the gut microbiota as an important modulator of the neuroinflammatory process and neurogenesis after TBI and provide an exciting new approach for neuroprotective therapeutics for TBI.",T cells; germ-free mice; gut microbiome; microglia; neurogenesis; traumatic brain injury.

However, it is not clear whether selenium deficiency and BPA exposure affect tracheal tissue pyroptosis in chickens. To investigate whether selenium deficiency and BPA exposure induce chicken tracheal tissue pyroptosis via the NF-κB/NLRP3/Caspase-1 pathway and the effect of their combined exposure on tissue injury, we developed a model of relevant chicken tracheal injury. Sixty broilers were divided into four groups: the control group (C group), selenium-deficient group (SeD group), BPA-exposed group (BPA group) and combined exposure group (SeD + BPA group). The study examined the expression indicators of markers of pyroptosis (NLRP3&GSDMD), NF-κB pathway-related inflammatory factors (NF-κB, iNOS, TNF-α, COX-2), pyroptosis-related factors (ASC, Caspase-1, IL-1β, IL-18), and some heat shock proteins and interleukins (HSP60, HSP90, IL-6, IL-17) in the samples. The results showed that the expression of the above indicators was significantly upregulated in the different treatment groups (P < 0.05). In addition, the expression levels of the above related indicators were more significantly up-regulated in the combined selenium-deficient and BPA-exposed group compared to the group in which they were individually exposed. It was concluded that selenium deficiency and BPA exposure induced tracheal tissue pyroptosis in chickens through NF-κB/NLRP3/Caspase-1 pathway, and BPA exposure exacerbated selenium deficiency-induced tracheal pyroptosis. The present study provides new ideas into studies related to the co-exposure of organismal micronutrient deficiency and chronic toxicants.",BPA; Chicken trachea; NF-κB/NLRP3; Pyroptosis; Selenium deficiency.

The key importance of the nitronyl nitroxide function is to translate molecular-level-optimized structures into nano-scale devices and new technologies. In spite of great importance, efficient and versatile synthetic approaches to these compounds still represent a challenge. Particularly, methods for the direct introduction of a nitronyl nitroxide moiety into aromatic systems possess many limitations. Here, we report gold derivatives of nitronyl nitroxide that can enter Pd(0)-catalysed cross-coupling reactions with various aryl bromides, affording the corresponding functionalized nitronyl nitroxides. Based on the high thermal stability and enhanced reactivity in catalytic transformation, a new reagent is suggested for the synthesis of radical systems via a universal cross-coupling approach.",molecular magnets; new reagent design; nitronyl nitroxides; radical reactions; thermal stability.

Therefore, this study aimed to determine whether there is an influence of extracurricular sports on executive functions and academic performance. However, it is less known which specific types of the sport better enhance executive functions in children; to investigate this issue, this study compared the performance on executive functions tasks and academic performance in one hundred and two boys and girls with an average age of 11.84 years recruited from Italian schools and gyms (N = 102), who participated in martial arts or team sports or were sedentary children. Executive functions were measured with the tests: Attenzione e Concentrazione, Digit Span test, Tower of London, IOWA Gambling task BVN 5-11, and BVN 12-18. Results demonstrated that children practicing martial arts showed better executive functioning and higher school marks than those involved in team sports or not involved in any sports. Furthermore, participants aged 12 to 15 years old outperformed in cool and hot executive functions tasks and had a better academic performance. Thus, the present findings supported the view that regular practice of extracurricular sports enhances executive functions development and consequently influences academic performance.",sport; physical activity and sport in youth; executive functions; academic performance

A scoping review,"N Gromek,J Perek-Białas,N Gromek,J Perek-Białas","Nowadays, pets more frequently are becoming family members which deserve certain products and goods, as well as services. In this way, pets are becoming consumers even they do not have a possibility to make decisions (as opposed to human being) as we analyze taking into account human being. Recently pet-related topics are gaining more attention in the press and among researchers in the field of marketing and psychology. Numerous articles regarding pet-related business patterns, like pet insurance, day care and pet friendly hotels are published. No wonder, the popularity of pets among households has been growing for many years. In this article, a scoping review aimed at identifying available studies about expenditures on pet goods and owners' economic consumption choices has been conducted. A comprehensive search strategy was used across Scopus and EBSCO database. The results show that there is only a few studies concerning pet goods consumption through the lens of economic theories.

The membranes are examined with respect to their coverage of a supporting mesh via atomic force microscopy measurements. Force indentation mapping was performed in the dried, collapsed state and in the swollen state in water to determine the Young modulus. Furthermore, we compare the catalytic activity of the membrane with the corresponding suspended colloidal nanoparticle microgel hybrids. For this purpose, the reduction of 4-nitrophenol is an established model reaction to quantify the catalytic activity by UV-vis spectroscopy. The membrane is embedded inside a continuous stirred tank reactor equipped for continuous monitoring of the reaction progress. Although catalysis with membranes shows lower catalytic activity than freely dispersed particles, membranes allow straightforward separation and recycling of the catalyst. The fabricated membranes in this work show no decrease in catalytic activity between several cycles, unlike free particles. The feasible and durable deposition of catalytically active inter-cross-linked microgel particles on commercial nylon meshes as supporting scaffolds, as demonstrated in this work, is promising for up-scaling of continuous industrial processes.",acrylamide; batch reactor; catalysis; membrane; microgel; nanoparticle.

This method combines coloration of the analyte and extraction of the colored species on dispersed particulates during their sedimentation in the same container. The whole analysis can be performed within 15 min by comprising the addition of 1 mL of sample solution into a 1.5-mL microtube containing the powders of coloring reagents and the sedimentable fine particulates as an adsorbent. The analyte is determined by comparing the sediment color with the standard color by visual inspection or the color information of the photo image. The potential of this methodology was demonstrated through developing colorimetry for Fe2+ with o-phenanthroline, NO2- by azo-dye formation, HCHO by the MBTH method, and PO43- by the 4-aminoantipyrine method based on the enzyme reactions. The material, size, amount of the adsorbent particles, and other conditions were optimized for each analytes. The advantages of the methodology were as follows: high sensitivity, easy controllability of the sensitivity over the wide range by the amount, size, and material of the particulates, lower interference from the colored matrix components due to obtaining the color data from not the aqueous phase but the sedimented particulates, and acceleration of the color development rate by the particulates as seen in NO2- determination as consequence shorten the operation time. A simple device equipped with twin cells was proposed for on-site analysis which contains two successive different coloring operations. The developed methods were successfully applied to the environmental water samples with the good agreement of the results with those by the usual instrumental methods.",Colorimetric analysis; On-site analysis; Sedimentable dispersed particulates; Solid-phase extraction.
1854,Class-Agnostic Weighted Normalization of Staining in Histopathology Images Using a Spatially Constrained Mixture Model,"Shafiei, Sobhan; Safarpoor, Amir; Jamalizadeh, Ahad; Tizhoosh, H. R.","The colorless biopsied tissue samples are usually stained in order to visualize different microscopic structures for diagnostic purposes. But color variations associated with the process of sample preparation, usage of raw materials, diverse staining protocols, and using different slide scanners may adversely influence both visual inspection and computer-aided image analysis. As a result, many methods are proposed for histopathology image stain normalization in recent years. In this study, we introduce a novel approach for stain normalization based on learning a mixture of multivariate skew-normal distributions for stain clustering and parameter estimation alongside a stain transformation technique. The proposed method, labeled ""Class-Agnostic Weighted Normalization"" (short CLAW normalization), has the ability to normalize a source image by learning the color distribution of both source and target images within an expectation-maximization framework. The novelty of this approach is its flexibility to quantify the underlying both symmetric and nonsymmetric distributions of the different stain components while it is considering the spatial information. The performance of this new stain normalization scheme is tested on several publicly available digital pathology datasets to compare it against state-of-the-art normalization algorithms in terms of ability to preserve the image structure and information. All in all, our proposed method performed superior more consistently in comparison with existing methods in terms of information preservation, visual quality enhancement, and boosting computer-aided diagnosis algorithm performance.",H&E staining; histopathology; skewnormal distribution; stain normalization; spatial information

1856,Reimagining Ocean Stewardship: Arts-Based Methods to 'Hear' and 'See' Indigenous and Local Knowledge in Ocean Management,"Strand, Mia; Rivers, Nina; Snow, Bernadette","Current ocean management approaches are often characterised by economic or environmental objectives, paying limited consideration to social and cultural dimensions, as well as Indigenous and local knowledge. These approaches tend to inhibit ocean stewardship, often marginalising coastal communities or limiting people's access to spiritual, traditional and recreational uses of the ocean and coast. Piloting arts-based participatory research methods to co-create knowledge with co-researchers in Algoa Bay, South Africa finds that these methods can be useful in highlighting cultural connections to the ocean, and remembering and imagining, or reimagining, ways in which people relate to and care for the ocean and coast. For example, using photography and in situ storytelling often allows people to convey memories and histories of more accessible coastlines, or envisaging a future with more inclusive and participatory ocean management. The study finds that there is a strong sense of exclusion from and lack of access to coastal and ocean areas in Algoa Bay where Indigenous and local communities have depended on for spiritual, cultural and recreational purposes for several generations. Co-creation of knowledge regarding connections, values and priorities of the coast and ocean with Indigenous and local communities should therefore be planned for before the implementation of integrated ocean management approaches and intentionally designed as part of adaptive management processes. Emphasising these cultural connections, and better recognising them in ocean management has the potential to include i people's awareness of the ocean which could translate into an increased sense of care and stewardship towards the ocean and coast as people feel more connected to their contextual seascapes. This could in turn contribute to a more sustainable sociocultural approach to ocean management which is necessary for equitable and sustainable future ocean social-ecological wellbeing.",ocean stewardship; arts-based methods; indigenous and local knowledge; inclusive ocean management; knowledge co-creation; cultural connections; South Africa

A 'zero alternative scenario' risk assessment has been undertaken in order to evaluate the potential radiological impact on humans and the environment of the facility, were it to be left in its current state with no remediation. The results have been used as a basis for regulatory decision making regarding remediation and decommissioning of the legacy radioactive waste facility. The aim of this study was two-fold: first to demonstrate a complete radiological risk assessment of a real site using a combination of methodologies developed by the IAEA (ISAM and BIOMASS), the second to illustrate the current state-of-the-art in respect of extracting site-specific information from site-descriptive material. We illustrate the practicality of employing geographic information systems techniques on site-specific topographic data to identify relevant biosphere dose objects, thereby allowing customisation of the generic ISAM model framework to site-specific conditions. As a result, a simple method is suggested to bound activity concentrations in well water based on an understanding of water balance in the local catchment area in which the biosphere dose object is embedded. With conservative assumptions, estimated doses from the calculation cases of the design scenario remain lower than the IAEA's dose criteria and environmental screening values. However, the results also indicate that human intrusion activities after the institutional control period could lead to radiological exposures above the IAEA's criteria for a period up to 100 000 years. The long-lived radionuclide Pu-239 dominates doses for the on-site residence scenario. Remediation measures should be implemented were the waste to remain at its present place of disposal.",legacy radioactive waste; RADON type disposal facility; radiological risk assessment; ISAM methodology; dynamic biosphere models; maximum dilution; BIOMASS

However, most of these studies are restricted to evaluating biological traits on artificial diets. Here, we investigated the fitness cost associated with chlorantraniliprole in Spodoptera frugiperda (J.E. Smith) feeding on corn, soybean, and cotton plants. We used a near-isogenic strain of S. frugiperda resistant to chlorantraniliprole (Iso-RR), a susceptible strain (SS), and heterozygotes strains (H1 and H2) to evaluate several biological and population growth parameters. Larval survival of the Iso-RR strain was on average 90% on corn, 65% on soybean, and 57% on cotton plants. Development time of the larval stage also differed among host plants, Iso-RR strain took on average 14, 17, and 26 days to reach the pupal stage on corn, soybean, and cotton plants respectively. Net reproductive rate, intrinsic rate of population increase, and finite rate of population increase were higher for Iso-RR strain feeding on corn plants than other host plants. The relative fitness, based on the intrinsic rate of population increase, of S. frugiperda resistant strain on corn, soybean, and cotton plants were 1.04, 0.85, and 0.88, respectively. Therefore, no fitness cost was observed for S. frugiperda feeding on corn plants, but a significant fitness cost was observed when this pest fed on soybean and cotton plants. We showed that the food source influences the fitness cost of S. frugiperda resistant to diamide.

Evidence from China's prefecture-level cities,"Liuyang Xu,Hechang Cai,Zilong Wang,Liuyang Xu,Hechang Cai,Zilong Wang","Air pollution hinders technological innovation, but the causal effects of air pollution on technology transfer are overlooked. We use thermal inversion as an instrumental variable for addressing air pollution endogeneity. The empirical results show that a one-unit increase in air pollution reduces technology transfer strength by 4.5 %. However, air pollution has a strong asymmetry in two directions of technology transfer strength. We find that those cities with worse pollution have an intention to transfer their technologies to cities in other provinces. In the PLFC model, heterogeneity varying with GDP can be addressed to estimate the marginal effect between them. Findings suggest that the marginal effects of air pollution on technology transfer can be divided into two parts based on GDP levels.

In this study, in vivo electrochemistry is combined with physiological and ethological analyses to explore oxygen metabolic consumption in an area of the mouse brain that includes parts of the primary somatosensory cortex, primary motor cortex, hippocampus, and striatum. The oxygen levels at different locations of this boundary section are spatially resolved by measuring the electrical current in vivo using ingeniously designed anti-biofouling carbon fiber microelectrodes. The characteristics of the current signals are further interpreted by simultaneously recording the physiological responses of the mice. Additionally, ethological tests are performed to validate the correlation between oxygen levels and mouse behavior. It is found that high-dose caffeine injection can evoke spatial variability in oxygen metabolic consumption between the four neighboring brain regions. It is proposed that the oxygen metabolic consumption in different brain regions is not independent of each other but is subject to spatial regulation control following the rules of ""rank of brain region"" and ""relative distance."" Furthermore, as revealed by in vivo wireless electrochemistry and ethological analysis, mice are at risk of neuronal damage from long-term intake of high-dose caffeine.",caffeine; in vivo electrochemistry; neighboring brain regions; oxygen metabolic consumption; spatial regulation control.

Knowledge that two face images belong to the same person facilitates the processing of identity information across images, but it is unclear if this also applies to trait judgements. In this preregistered study, participants (N = 100) rated the same 340 face images on perceived trustworthiness, dominance, or attractiveness presented in randomised order and again later presented in sets consisting of the same identity. We also explored the role of implicit person theory beliefs in the variability of social judgements across images. We found that judgements of trustworthiness varied less when images were presented in sets consisting of the same identity than in randomised order and were more consistent for images presented later in a set than those presented earlier. However, knowledge of identity had little effect on perceptions of dominance and attractiveness. Finally, implicit person theory beliefs were not associated with variability in social judgements and did not account for effects of knowledge of identity. Our findings suggest that knowledge of identity and perceptual familiarity stabilises judgements of trustworthiness, but not perceptions of dominance and attractiveness.",Face perception; first impressions; trait judgements; within-person variability.

In contrast to the chloride-dependent performance of the US laboratory strain of H. azteca, growth of a genetically distinct strain of H. azteca obtained from an Environment Canada laboratory in Burlington, Ontario, Canada, was not influenced by chloride concentration. In acute toxicity tests with the US laboratory strain of H. azteca, the acute toxicity of sodium nitrate increased with decreasing chloride in a pattern similar not only to that observed for control growth, but also to previous acute toxicity testing with sodium sulfate. Subsequent testing with the Burlington strain showed no significant relationship between chloride concentration and the acute toxicity of sodium nitrate or sodium sulfate. These findings suggest that the chloride-dependent toxicity shown for the US laboratory strain may be an unusual feature of that strain and perhaps not broadly representative of aquatic organisms as a whole.",Chloride; Genetic strain; Hyalella azteca; Nitrate; Toxicity testing.

Due to limited number of control pins and routing resources, additional Printed Circuit Board (PCB) routing layers may be required which potentially raises the fabrication cost. Previous state-of-the-art work has tried to develop a framework that uses a network-flow-based method for broadcast electrodeaddressing EWOD biochips. Nevertheless, greedily merging of electrical pins in previous works is at high risk of producing unroutable design. Routability should have higher priority than pin reduction. While previous works dedicated their effort on pin reduction, we have addressed our attention on routability of broadcast addressing. Experimental results demonstrate that taking routability into consideration can even have higher pin reduction. Viewed in this light, we present ACER, a routability driven clustering algorithm followed by escape routing using integer linear programming that effectively solves both pin merging and routing in broadcast addressing framework. Our proposed algorithm does not greedily focus on pin-reduction. Instead, routability is taken into consideration through agglomerative clustering.

1871,Localisation of the painter's canvas: landscape paintings from the Iron Mountains (Czech Republic),"Frajer, Jindrich; Simacek, Petr","Landscape has always been the focus of artistic interest. Landscape is also the object of research interest of geographers, and it offers a field for cooperation between art and geography. Our study focuses on landscape painting as an important source in identifying landscape changes. We focused on discovering the location where the painter placed his canvas. We used Czech landscape paintings from the end of the nineteenth century in the Iron Mountains. We have combined information about paintings and their authors with terrain analysis in GIS. We have carried out field research and consulted a painter to localise the locations where the landscapes were painted. Main map depicts the sites of selected landscape paintings from where the painters captured the image of the landscape. Our proposed combination of terrain analysis with the information about the paintings and the painters is a convenient way to identify the sites of the paintings.",Landscape painting; geography; Digital Elevation Model; land use; historical landscape; Czech Republic

1874,Image Denoising Using Mixtures of Projected Gaussian Scale Mixtures,"Goossens, Bart; Pizurica, Aleksandra; Philips, Wilfried","We propose a new statistical model for image restoration in which neighborhoods of wavelet subbands are modeled by a discrete mixture of linear projected Gaussian Scale Mixtures (MPGSM). In each projection, a lower dimensional approximation of the local neighborhood is obtained, thereby modeling the strongest correlations in that neighborhood. The model is a generalization of the recently developed Mixture of GSM (MGSM) model, that offers a significant improvement both in PSNR and visually compared to the current state-of-the-art wavelet techniques. However, the computation cost is very high which hampers its use for practical purposes. We present a fast EM algorithm that takes advantage of the projection bases to speed up the algorithm. The results show that, when projecting on a fixed data-independent basis, even computational advantages with a limited loss of PSNR can be obtained with respect to the BLS-GSM denoising method, while data-dependent bases of Principle Components offer a higher denoising performance, both visually and in PSNR compared to the current wavelet-based state-of-the-art denoising methods.",Bayesian estimation; Gaussian scale mixtures; image denoising
1875,Semantics-Aware Autoencoder,"Bellini, Vito; Di Noia, Tommaso; Di Sciascio, Eugenio; Schiavone, Angelo","Recommender Systems are widely adopted in nowadays services such as e-commerce websites, multimedia streaming platforms, and many others. They help users to find what they are looking for by suggesting relevant items leveraging their past preferences. Deep Learning models are very effective in solving the recommendation problem; as a matter of fact, many deep learning architectures have been proposed over the years. Even if deep learning models outperform many state-of-the-art algorithms, the worst disadvantage is about their interpretability: explaining the reason a specific item has been recommended to a user is quite a difficult task since the model is not interpretable. Accuracy in the recommendation is no more enough since users are also expecting a useful explanation for the suggested items. Users, on the other hand, want to know why. In this paper, we present SemAuto, a novel approach based on an Autoencoder Neural Network that makes it possible to semantically label neurons in hidden layers, thus paving the way to the model's interpretability and consequently to the explanation of a recommendation. We tested our semantics aware approach with respect to other state-of-the-art algorithms to prove the recommendation's accuracy.

1876,Derivative-Based Steganographic Distortion and its Non-additive Extensions for Audio,"Chen, Kejiang; Zhou, Hang; Li, Weixiang; Yang, Kuan; Zhang, Weiming; Yu, Nenghai","Steganography is the art of covert communication, which aims to hide the secret messages into cover medium while achieving high undetectability. To this end, the framework of minimal distortion embedding is widely adopted for adaptive steganography, where a well-designed distortion function is significant. In this paper, inspired by the phenomenon that the modification of audio samples with the low amplitude will be easily detected, a novel distortion is presented for audio steganography. Taking the fragility of the low amplitude audio samples into account, the proposed distortion is inversely proportional to the amplitude. Furthermore, in order to resist the strong steganalysis, the derivative filter is utilized for acquiring the residual of audio, which plays an important role in distortion definition. The experimental results show that the proposed distortion outperforms the state-of-the-art methods defending strong steganalytic methods. To take a step forward, considering the mutual impact caused by embedding modification, the non-additive extensions of the proposed methods are put forward. The extending experiments show that in most cases, the proposed non-additive extensions can achieve higher level of security than the original methods.",Distortion; Additives; Security; Media; Predistortion; Art; Feature extraction; Steganography; derivate filter; non-additive; amplitude

Polyaniline (PANI) is an attractive humidity sensing material due to its designable functional properties. However, PANI modified polyoxometalates (POMs) for humidity sensing are still rare. As a proof of concept, a novel moisture sensing composite material was obtained based on PANI and a novel 1D rare-earth-substituted phospho(III)tungstate [H2N(CH3)2]9Na3H6[Ce2(H2O)3W5O13(C2O4)][HPIIIW9O33]2[(HPIII)2W15O54]·42H2O (1).

Furthermore, the 1/PANI composite shows a typical semiconductive characteristic with a ""band-like"" conductive mechanism. The fabricated 1/PANI-based humidity sensing device exhibits a broad sensing range (11∼97% relative humidity), fast response/recovery time (3.45 s/3.24 s), good repeatability, and long-term stability (over 3 months). Additionally, the possible sensing mechanism is proposed.

1878,ECG compression using optimized B-spline,"Mohebbian, Mohammad Reza; Wahid, Khan A.","Electrocardiogram (ECG) is widely used in the medical field due to the non-invasive detecting of cardiac anomalies. Transmission, storage, and monitoring are necessary for all ECG platforms, from conventional ECG recording methods to portable and wearable approaches. In this regard, compression algorithms are used for reducing data size which makes transmitting and storing easier. In this paper, an efficient semi-lossless compression technique is designed that can be used for monitoring and visualization. The compression technique used a combination of B-spline interpolation and ant colony optimization. Since the B-Spline coefficients of the signal are calculated as compressed data, the signal can be visualized without decompression which can save time respecting to state-of-the-art techniques. The MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database and 30 recorded ECG are used for validation. Averagely, 7.8 +/- 1.1 compression ratio and 2.3 +/- 1.4% percentage root-mean-square difference are achieved. Moreover, The experimental analysis proves the superiority of the proposed technique over state-of-the-art techniques and ensures efficient compression, as well as preserving the quality of the original ECG.",ECG; Signal compression; B-spline; Semi lossless

To reveal the impact of human activities on watershed weathering and water chemistry in Taihu sub-watersheds, historical water chemistry data (1950s-1970s) and recent water samples (2018-2021) of the local river systems, as well as sediment samples of Taihu lake were collected and analyzed, and a linear addition mass balance method was used to determine the weathering rate at the sub-watershed level. The results indicated that, compared with 60 years ago, the current weathering rate of carbonates and silicates in the Taoge water system (TG) was the highest, reaching 67.2 and 11.4 t·km-2·a-1, increasing by 4.1 and 2.7-folds, respectively; and meanwhile the carbonate and silicate weathering rates increased by 3.1 and 4.9-folds in the Nanhe water system (NH), and 5.2 and 3.4-folds in the Tiaoxi water system (TX), respectively. The increasing rate was significantly correlated to the atmospheric SO2 concentration in different sub-watersheds and was affected by the sub-watershed lithology, e.g., TX had a higher increase rate of silicate weathering due to the wider distribution of silicates in this sub-watershed than the other two. The sediment evidence of Na/K and Ca/Al on the profile in different lake parts, which was influenced by different influx river systems, confirmed that the overall intensity of watershed weathering was higher in TG than in the TX sub-watershed and was higher in the recent decade than 50-60 years ago. The accelerated weathering rate was found to present a definite consistency with the social and economic development in the watershed. Combined analyses of the accelerated weathering rate in the watershed and sedimentation evidence indicated that the major driving force for the watershed weathering has shifted from carbonic acid under the natural condition to human-induced sulfuric acid since 1980s.",Human activities; Lithology; Sedimentation; Taihu watershed; Weathering rate.

We explore the impact on the incidence of Congenital Rubella Syndrome (CRS) during 2013-2050 of this strategy and variants involving women aged 15-35 years. We use an age and sex-structured dynamic transmission model, set up using recently-collected seroprevalence data from Central Vietnam, and also consider different levels of transmission and contact patterns. If the serological profile resembles that in Central Vietnam, the planned vaccination strategy could potentially prevent 125,000 CRS cases by 2050 in Vietnam, despite outbreaks predicted in the meantime. Targeting the initial campaign at 15-35 year old women with or without children aged 9 months-14 years led to sustained reductions in incidence, unless levels of ongoing transmission were medium-high before vaccination started. Assumptions about contact greatly influenced predictions if the initial campaign just targeted 15-35 year old women and/or levels of ongoing transmission were medium-high. Given increased interest in rubella vaccination, resulting from GAVI Alliance funding, the findings are relevant for many countries.","rubella, Congenital Rubella Syndrome, measles-rubella vaccination, mathematical modelling, Vietnam."

The framework can efficiently predict whether or not a CT scan contains pneumonia while simultaneously identifying pneumonia types between COVID-19 and Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD) caused by other viruses. In the proposed method, two 3D-ResNets are coupled together into a single model for the two above-mentioned tasks via a novel prior-attention strategy. We extend residual learning with the proposed prior-attention mechanism and design a new so-called prior-attention residual learning (PARL) block. The model can be easily built by stacking the PARL blocks and trained end-to-end using multi-task losses. More specifically, one 3D-ResNet branch is trained as a binary classifier using lung images with and without pneumonia so that it can highlight the lesion areas within the lungs. Simultaneously, inside the PARL blocks, prior-attention maps are generated from this branch and used to guide another branch to learn more discriminative representations for the pneumonia-type classification. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework can significantly improve the performance of COVID-19 screening. Compared to other methods, it achieves a state-of-the-art result.

1886,Scalable Packet Classification on FPGA,"Jiang, Weirong; Prasanna, Viktor K.","Multi-field packet classification has evolved from traditional fixed 5-tuple matching to flexible matching with arbitrary combination of numerous packet header fields. For example, the recently proposed OpenFlow switching requires classifying each packet using up to 12-tuple packet header fields. It has become a great challenge to develop scalable solutions for next-generation packet classification that support higher throughput, larger rule sets and more packet header fields. This paper exploits the abundant parallelism and other desirable features provided by current field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), and proposes a decision-tree-based, 2-D multi-pipeline architecture for next-generation packet classification. We revisit the techniques for traditional 5-tuple packet classification and propose several optimization techniques for the state-of-the-art decision-tree-based algorithm. Given a set of 12-tuple rules, we develop a framework to partition the rule set into multiple subsets each of which is built into an optimized decision tree. A tree-to-pipeline mapping scheme is carefully designed to maximize the memory utilization while sustaining high throughput. The implementation results show that our architecture can store either 10K real-life 5-tuple rules or 1K synthetic 12-tuple rules in on-chip memory of a single state-of-the-art FPGA, and sustain 80 and 40 Gbps throughput for minimum size (40 bytes) packets, respectively.",Decision tree; field-programmable gate array (FPGA); openflow; packet classification; pipeline; SRAM

It takes advantage of continuity and inertia of both target and camera motion, and provides reliable evidence to resolve confusion caused by appearance similarity between targets and the background.

We aimed to assess myocardial function by strain echocardiography after hospital discharge and to identify risk factors for subacute myocardial dysfunction. We conducted a retrospective single-center study of MIS-C patients admitted between 03/2020 and 03/2021. Global longitudinal strain (GLS), 4-chamber longitudinal strain (4C-LS), mid-ventricular circumferential strain (CS), and left atrial strain (LAS) were measured on echocardiograms performed 3-10 weeks after discharge and compared with controls. Among 60 MIS-C patients, hypotension (65%), ICU admission (57%), and vasopressor support (45%) were common, with no mortality. LVEF was abnormal (< 55%) in 29% during hospitalization but only 4% at follow-up. Follow-up strain abnormalities were prevalent (GLS abnormal in 13%, 4C-LS in 18%, CS in 16%, LAS in 5%). Hypotension, ICU admission, ICU and hospital length of stay, and any LVEF < 55% during hospitalization were factors associated with lower strain at follow-up. Higher peak C-reactive protein (CRP) was associated with hypotension, ICU admission, total ICU days, and with lower follow-up GLS (r = - 0.55; p = 0.01) and CS (r = 0.41; p = 0.02). Peak CRP < 18 mg/dL had negative predictive values of 100% and 88% for normal follow-up GLS and CS, respectively. A subset of MIS-C patients demonstrate subclinical systolic and diastolic function abnormalities at subacute follow-up. Peak CRP during hospitalization may be a useful marker for outpatient cardiac risk stratification.

Visual tracking is one of the most promising fields of application of these methods, and although many approaches have been proposed, their main disadvantage is the convergence at local minima which make them unable to find the exact position. To overcome this drawback, we propose to use an algorithm that provides an efficient exploration of the search space, which is stochastic fractal search (SFS) algorithm. SFS is used as a localization method, to find the most similar candidate to a previous defined template. Standard kernel-based spatial color histogram of the object bounding box, is evaluated in order to model the object appearance. Subsequently, Bhattacharyya distance is measured between the two histograms of the model and the candidate to define the fitness function, in which optimization is sought. To assess fairly the robustness of our approach, we have evaluated its performance on 20 video sequences from the OTB-100 sequences dataset and compared it to 11 other state-of-the-art trackers. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations on challenging situations provided satisfying results of SFS-based tracker compared to other state-of-the-art algorithms.",SFS algorithm; Object tracking; Metaheuristics

1893,Decorated boulders and other neglected features of the Central Saharan rock art,"Soukopova, Jitka","Although the Central Saharan rock art has been studied for more than five decades, attention has been given almost exclusively to figurative paintings and engravings. Images were divided into stylistic groups, which functioned as a sequence of relative chronology. Non-figurative engravings, such as grooves, ovals, kettles and cupules, have been considered only marginally or were completely ignored. Next to the impressive images of animals and human beings, these small engravings were not even considered a true form of rock art and were never included into the stylistic rock art table. Even more surprising is the exclusion of Kel Essuf. These particular anthropomorphic petroglyphs were already known in the 1960s, however, because of their marked stylistic and thematic difference from other engravings, they were treated as anomalous and, like the non-figurative art, they were not included among the official styles. This paper focuses on previously neglected or unpublished rock art, and suggests that the simplest engravings are signs bearing their own meaning. When studied as a whole instead of being treated as isolated units without any relation to other forms of rock art, it emerges that grooves, ovals, cupules and Kel Essuf engravings were probably created following the same pattern.",Engravings; Grooves; Kel essuf; Ovals; Cupules; Kettles
1894,Real-time iris segmentation and its implementation on FPGA,"Khan, Tariq M.; Bailey, Donald G.; Khan, Mohammad A. U.; Kong, Yinan","This paper presents a real-time iris segmentation technique that is well suited to a fast implementation on an FPGA. One major hurdle associated with iris segmentation techniques is the use of iterative processes that lead to expensive hardware implementations. To circumvent this, the proposed algorithm uses the sign image obtained from subtracting the background, along with morphological operators to localise the pupil. The outer boundary is located by first normalising a selected image region that contains the iris, and then using a first-order gradient operator. The proposed non-iterative algorithm is implemented on an FPGA. Four near infrared (NIR) iris public databases, namely: CASIA-IrisV3-Lamp, MMU v1.0, ND-IRIS-0405 and NIST ICE 2005, are used to test the proposed algorithm. The proposed method for iris segmentation and normalization gives much better accuracy than the existing state-of-the-art methods implemented on hardware.

In this paper, we propose a framework for tracking these structures based on the random finite set Bayesian filtering framework. We focus on challenging biological applications where image characteristics such as noise and background intensity change during the acquisition process. Under these conditions, detection methods usually fail to detect all particles and are often followed by missed detections and many spurious measurements with unknown and time-varying rates. To deal with this, we propose a bootstrap filter composed of an estimator and a tracker. The estimator adaptively estimates the required meta parameters for the tracker such as clutter rate and the detection probability of the targets, while the tracker estimates the state of the targets. Our results show that the proposed approach can outperform state-of-the-art particle trackers on both synthetic and real data in this regime.",Bayesian estimation; cardinalized probability hypothesis density (CPHD); clutter rate; detection probability; fluorescence microscopy; multi-target tracking; particle tracking; random finite set

The ability to collect, purify, and manipulate primary cells outside the body permits testing of many different gene editing approaches. RNA-guided nucleases, such as CRISPR, have revolutionized gene editing based simply on Watson-Crick base-pairing, employed to direct activity to specific genomic loci. Given the ease and affordability of synthetic, custom RNA guides, testing of precision edits or large random pools in high-throughput screening studies is now widely available. With the ever-growing number of CRISPR nucleases being discovered or engineered, researchers now have a plethora of options for directed genomic change, including single base edits, nicks or double-stranded DNA cuts with blunt or staggered ends, as well as the ability to target CRISPR to other cellular oligonucleotides such as RNA or mitochondrial DNA. Except for single base editing strategies, precise rewriting of larger segments of the genetic code requires delivery of an additional component, templated DNA oligonucleotide(s) encoding the desired changes flanked by homologous sequences that permit recombination at or near the site of CRISPR activity. Altogether, the ever-growing CRISPR gene editing toolkit is an invaluable resource.

To minimize the potential health risk caused by the tracer radiation inherent to PET scans, it is of great interest to synthesize the high-quality PET image from the low-dose one to reduce the radiation exposure. In this paper, we proposea 3D auto-context-based locality adaptive multi-modality generative adversarial networks model (LA-GANs) to synthesize the high-quality FDG PET image from the low-dose one with the accompanying MRI images that provide anatomical information. Our work has four contributions. First, different from the traditional methods that treat each imagemodality as an input channel and apply the same kernel to convolve the whole image, we argue that the contributions of differentmodalities could vary at different image locations, and therefore a unified kernel for a whole image is not optimal. To address this issue, we propose a locality adaptive strategy for multi-modality fusion. Second, we utilize 1 x 1 x 1 kernel to learn this locality adaptive fusion so that the number of additional parameters incurred by our method is kept minimum. Third, the proposed locality adaptive fusionmechanism is learned jointly with the PET image synthesis in a 3D conditional GANs model, which generates high-quality PET images by employing large-sized image patches and hierarchical features. Fourth, we apply the auto-context strategy to our scheme and propose an auto-contextLA-GANsmodel to further refine the quality of synthesized images. Experimental results show that our method outperforms the traditional multi-modality fusion methods used in deep networks, as well as the state-of-the-art PET estimation approaches.",Image synthesis; positron emission topography (PET); generative adversarial networks (GANs); locality adaptive fusion; multi-modality

For that reason it is important to carry out periodic air quality controls to check if the concentration levels of air pollutants comply with the limits specified by the national laws. In this work we show results obtained in a monitoring campaign carried out at the Museum of Capodimonte in Naples, one of the most important museums in Southern Italy. Results concern indoor monitoring of inorganic and organic gaseous pollutants and PM10 and PM2.5 fractions; moreover we also present the comparison between indoor and outdoor particulate matter concentration. From this analysis emerged a satisfying indoor condition with respect to gaseous pollutants, without any limit exceedance; in contrast particulate matter exhibits high concentration levels with frequent exceedances. Comparison with outdoor concentrations demonstrates the influence of dust and organic matter transported from the park surrounding the museum due to wind and visitors stamping.",Indoor Pollution; Cultural Heritage; Indoor monitoring; Gaseous pollutants; Particulate matter
1899,Stabilizing peer-to-peer energy trading in prosumer coalition through computational efficient pricing,"Li, Jing; Ye, Yujian; Strbac, Goran","Load balancing issues in distribution networks have emerged alongside the large-scale deployment of distributed renewable generation sources. In light of this challenge, peer-to-peer (P2P) energy trading constitutes a promising approach for delivering secure and economic supply-demand balance when faced with variable load and intermittent renewable generation through matching energy demand and supply locally. However, state-of-the-art mechanisms for governing P2P energy trading either fail to suitably incentivize prosumers to participate in P2P trading or suffer severely from the curse of dimensionality with their computational complexity increase exponentially with the number of prosumers. In this paper, a P2P energy trading mechanism based on cooperative game theory is proposed to establish a grand energy coalition of prosumers and a computationally efficient pricing algorithm is developed to suitably incentivize prosumers for their sustainable participation in the grand coalition. The performance of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated by comparing it to state-of-the-art mechanisms through numerous case studies in a real-world scenario. The superior computational performance of the proposed algorithm is also validated.",Cooperative game theory; Distributed energy resources; Energy coalition; Prosumer; Peer-to-peer energy trading
1900,New access modes of parallel memory subsystem for sub-pixel motion estimation,"Jakovljevic, Radomir; Beric, Aleksandar; van Dalen, Edwin; Milicev, Dragan","Accessing pixels in memory is a well-known bottleneck of SIMD (single instruction multiple data) processors in video/imaging. To tackle it, we propose new block and row access modes of parallel on-chip memory subsystem, which enable a higher processing throughput and lower energy consumption than the access modes of the state-of-the-art subsystems. The new access modes significantly reduce the number of on-chip memory accesses, and thereby accelerate one of key video/imaging kernels: sub-pixel block-matching motion estimation. The main idea is to exploit spatial overlaps of blocks/rows accessed for pixel interpolation, which are known at the subsystem design-time, and merge multiple accesses into a single one by accessing somewhat more pixels at a time than with other parallel memories. To avoid the need for a wider, and, therefore, more costly SIMD datapath, we propose new memory read operations that split all pixels accessed at a time into multiple SIMD-wide blocks/rows, in a convenient way for further processing. As a proof of concept, we describe a parametric, scalable, and cost-efficient architecture that supports the new access modes. The architecture is based on a previously proposed set of memory banks with multiple pixels per bank word, and a previously proposed shifted scheme for arranging pixels in the banks. We analytically and experimentally demonstrate advantages of this work on a case study of sub-pixel motion estimation for video frame-rate conversion. The implemented motion estimator processes 2160p video at 60 fps in real time, while clocked at 600 MHz. Compared to the implementations based on the state-of-the-art subsystems, this work enables 40-70 % higher throughput, consumes 17-44 % less energy and has similar silicon area and off-chip memory bandwidth costs. That is 1.8-2.9 times more efficient than the prior art, considering the throughput and all costs, i.e., consumption, area, and off-chip bandwidth. Such a higher efficiency is the result of the new access modes, which reduced the number of on-chip memory accesses by 1.6-2.1 times, and the cost-efficient architecture.",Block access; Row access; SIMD; Throughput; Energy consumption; Block-matching; Pixel interpolation

In this paper, we present a unique method based on combining a common photochromic molecule spiropyran (SP) with hydrogen-bonded organic frameworks (HOFs), which allows for reversible switching of SP in solid states and shows dynamic displays of encrypted information. With the irradiation time extended, the fluorescence emission undergo an evident transformation from yellow-green to orange to red, because of the fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) process between the unique HOFs and merocyanine (MC) isomer. By doping with polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), we obtained free-standing membranes with high flexibility and mechanical strength, which can be reversibly and repeatedly bent and folded at angles of >90°. Notably, the comparison of fatigue resistance between SP2/PDMS (can be used for no more than 5 times) and SP2 ⊂ HOF2/PDMS (can be used for more than 100 times) further proved the importance of HOFs. This composite system has many advantages: (1) it has diverse dynamic fluorescence emission and visible colors regulated by ultraviolet radiation with high contrast and can be reversibly converted; (2) these changes in behavior can be achieved by simple UV illumination; and (3) compared with previous work, this work not only shows the dynamic fluorescence emission, but also shows the dynamic information during the decryption.",Dynamic anticounterfeiting; Fluorescent patterns; Hydrogen-bonded organic framework; Membrane; Spiropyran.

Most state-of-the-art technologies have recently used deep classification networks to create small and sparse discriminatory seed regions of each interest target as pseudo-labels for training segmentation networks, which achieve inferior performance compared with the fully supervised setting. We propose a Dilated convolutional pixels affinity network (DCPAN) to localize and expand the seed regions of objects to bridge this gap. Although introduced dilated convolutional units enable capture of additional location information of objects, it falsely highlighted true negative regions as dilated rate enlarge. To address this problem, we properly integrate dilated convolutional units with different dilated rates and self-attention mechanisms to obtain pixel affinity measure matrix for promoting classification network to generate high-quality object seed regions as pseudo-labels; thus, the performance of the segmentation network is boosted. Furthermore, although our approach seems simple, our method obtains a competitive performance, and experiments show that the performance of DCPAN outperforms other state-of-art approaches in weakly-supervised settings, which only use image-level labels on the Pascal VOC 2012 dataset.",Weakly supervised; Semantic segmentation; Convolutional neural networks; Dilated convolution; Self-attention mechanism

At present, numerous studies have confirmed the important role of IL-17A in sepsis, but the role of secukinumab in sepsis has not been studied. The present study explored the protective effect and underlying mechanism of secukinumab in severe sepsis model rats. We established a severe sepsis rat model using cecal ligation and puncture (CLP). The optimal dose of secukinumab was determined by observing the 7-day survival rate of severe sepsis model rats. The expression levels of TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-17A in plasma and lung tissue were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The degree of pathological damage to lung tissue was evaluated by hematoxylin-eosin (H-E) staining and pathological damage scale. The expressions of IKBα/NFκB pathway proteins and downstream-related inflammatory factors were detected by western blotting and real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). Our results show that high-dose secukinumab can inhibit the activation of the IKBα/NFκB inflammatory pathway by neutralizing IL-17A and reducing the gene expression of pathway-related inflammatory cytokines, thereby reducing the levels of inflammatory cytokines in lung tissue and plasma, thereby reducing the damage of lung tissue in severe sepsis model rats and improving the systemic inflammatory response.",Acute lung injury; IL-17A; Inflammatory pathway; Secukinumab; Sepsis.

In detection model, the transformer module is introduced and contrastive loss is added to improve the performance of fine-grained object detection.

1907,The Effects of Iconicity and Conventionalization on Word Order Preferences,"Yasamin Motamedi,Lucie Wolters,Marieke Schouwstra,Simon Kirby,Yasamin Motamedi,Lucie Wolters,Marieke Schouwstra,Simon Kirby","Of the six possible orderings of the three main constituents of language (subject, verb, and object), two-SOV and SVO-are predominant cross-linguistically. Previous research using the silent gesture paradigm in which hearing participants produce or respond to gestures without speech has shown that different factors such as reversibility, salience, and animacy can affect the preferences for different orders. Here, we test whether participants' preferences for orders that are conditioned on the semantics of the event change depending on (i) the iconicity of individual gestural elements and (ii) the prior knowledge of a conventional lexicon. Our findings demonstrate the same preference for semantically conditioned word order found in previous studies, specifically that SOV and SVO are preferred differentially for different types of events. We do not find that iconicity of individual gestures affects participants' ordering preferences; however, we do find that learning a lexicon leads to a stronger preference for SVO-like orders overall. Finally, we compare our findings from English speakers, using an SVO-dominant language, with data from speakers of an SOV-dominant language, Turkish. We find that, while learning a lexicon leads to an increase in SVO preference for both sets of participants, this effect is mediated by language background and event type, suggesting that an interplay of factors together determines preferences for different ordering patterns. Taken together, our results support a view of word order as a gradient phenomenon responding to multiple biases.",Conventionalization; Iconicity; Silent gesture; Word order.
1908,DSI-Net: Deep Synergistic Interaction Network for Joint Classification and Segmentation With Endoscope Images,"Zhu, Meilu; Chen, Zhen; Yuan, Yixuan","Automatic classification and segmentation of wireless capsule endoscope (WCE) images are two clinically significant and relevant tasks in a computer-aided diagnosis system for gastrointestinal diseases. Most of existing approaches, however, considered these two tasks individually and ignored their complementary information, leading to limited performance. To overcome this bottleneck, we propose a deep synergistic interaction network (DSI-Net) for joint classification and segmentation with WCE images, which mainly consists of the classification branch (C-Branch), the coarse segmentation (CS-Branch) and the fine segmentation branches (FS-Branch). In order to facilitate the classification task with the segmentation knowledge, a lesion location mining (LLM) module is devised in C-Branch to accurately highlight lesion regions through mining neglected lesion areas and erasing misclassified background areas. To assist the segmentation task with the classification prior, we propose a category-guided feature generation (CFG) module in FS-Branch to improve pixel representation by leveraging the category prototypes of C-Branch to obtain the category-aware features. In such way, these modules enable the deep synergistic interaction between these two tasks. In addition, we introduce a task interaction loss to enhance the mutual supervision between the classification and segmentation tasks and guarantee the consistency of their predictions. Relying on the proposed deep synergistic interaction mechanism, DSI-Net achieves superior classification and segmentation performance on public dataset in comparison with state-of-the-art methods.

1909,Efficient Particle Scale Space for Robust Tracking,"Li, Shengjie; Zhao, Shuai; Cheng, Bo; Chen, Junliang","Both siamese network and correlation filter (CF) based trackers have recently achieved superior performance in tracking scenarios with various challenging factors. For the challenging scale variations, most of these state-of-the-art trackers usually employ multiple patches with different bounding boxes to estimate the target size. However, these patches are fixedly generated by the hand-crafted bounding boxes in spatial domains, which may be suboptimal to cope with scale changes due to the lack of temporal scale information. In this letter, we tackle the problem of efficient scale estimation by presenting a generic scheme that allows the adaptive generation of bounding boxes in temporal domains and improves the tracking accuracy. Specifically, we introduce the novel particle scale space by refining the conventional particle filter and extend this space to many siamese and CF trackers for robust tracking. Extensive experiments are performed on the OTB2013, OTB50, OTB100 and UAVDT datasets.

In this study, a controlled electrophoretic deposition strategy was used to develop a binder-free spinel oxide nanoparticle-coated Ni foam as an efficient electrocatalyst for water oxidation. Oxygen evolution was successfully promoted using the CoFe2O4 catalyst, and it was optimized by modulating the electrophoretic parameters. When optimized, CoFe2O4 nanoparticles presented more active catalytic sites, superior charge transfer, increased ion diffusion, and favorable reaction kinetics, which led to a small overpotential of 287 mV for a current density of 10 mA cm-2, with a small Tafel slope of 43 mV dec-1. Moreover, the CoFe2O4 nanoparticle electrode exhibited considerable long-term stability over 100 h without detectable activity loss.

The PET images are analyzed and processed in the transform domain by modeling each subband as a set of different regions separated by boundaries. Homogeneous and heterogeneous regions are considered. Each region is independently processed using different filters: a linear estimator for homogeneous regions and a surface polynomial estimator for the heterogeneous region. The boundaries between the different regions are estimated using a modified edge focusing filter. The proposed approach was validated by a series of experiments. Our method achieved an overall reduction of up to 26% in the % STD of the reconstructed image of a small animal NEMA phantom. Additionally, a test on a simulated lesion showed that our method yields better contrast preservation than other state-of-the art techniques used for noise reduction.

Although new and more potent antibiotics have aided the fight against microbes, they only offer a temporary solution because future bacteria strains may become resistant to these antibiotics and drugs. Recently, application of non-biological methods such as, electrical currents and photothermal/dynamic therapies to kill bacteria, reveal new approaches to design antimicrobial biomaterials, as complications stemming from drug-resistant bacteria can be obviated.

The chain with CCS comprises post-combustion CO2 capture with monoethanolamine, compression, transport by pipeline and storage in a geological reservoir. The two reference chains represent sub-critical and state-of-the-art ultra supercritical pulverized coal fired electricity generation. For the three chains we have constructed a detailed greenhouse gas (GHG) balance, and disclosed environmental trade-offs and co-benefits due to CO2 capture, transport and storage. Results show that, due to CCS, the GHG emissions per kWh are reduced substantially to 243 g/kWh. This is a reduction of 78 and 71% compared to the sub-critical and state-of-the-art power plant, respectively. The removal Of CO2 is partially offset by increased GHG emissions in up- and downstream processes, to a small extent (0.7 g/kWh) caused by the CCS infrastructure. An environmental co-benefit is expected following from the deeper reduction of hydrogen fluoride and hydrogen chloride emissions. Most notable environmental trade-offs are the increase in human toxicity, ozone layer depletion and fresh water ecotoxicity potential for which the CCS chain is outperformed by both other chains. The state-of-the-art power plant without CCS also shows a better score for the eutrophication, acidification and photochemical oxidation potential despite the deeper reduction of SO, and NO, in the CCS power plant. These reductions are offset by increased emissions in the life cycle due to the energy penalty and a factor five increase in NH3 emissions. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Meanwhile, although the synthetic datasets (e.g., SynthText90k) usually contain millions of samples, they cannot fit the data distribution of the small target datasets in natural scenes completely. To address these problems, we propose a word data generating method called SynthText-Transfer, which is capable of emulating the distribution of the target dataset. SynthText-Transfer uses a style transfer method to generate samples with arbitray text content, which preserve the texture of the reference sample in the target dataset. The generated images are not only visibly similar with real images, but also capable of improving the accuracy of the state-of-the-art text recognition methods, especially for the English and Chinese dataset with a large alphabet (in which many characters only appear in few samples, making it hard to learn for sequence models).

It is, however, challenging to preoperatively predict surgery duration since it varies significantly depending on the patient condition, surgeon skills, and intraoperative situation. In this paper, we propose a deep learning pipeline, referred to as RSDNet, which automatically estimates the remaining surgery duration (RSD) intraoperatively by using only visual information from laparoscopic videos. The previous state-of-the-art approaches for RSD prediction are dependentonmanual annotation, whose generation requires expensive expert knowledge and is time-consuming, especially considering the numerous types of surgeries performed in a hospital and the large number of laparoscopic videos available. A crucial feature of RSD-Net is that it does not depend on any manual annotation during training, making it easily scalable to many kinds of surgeries. The generalizability of our approach is demonstrated by testing the pipelineon two large datasets containing different types of surgeries: 120 cholecystectomy and 170 gastric bypass videos.

1919,Implementation of Tele-Intensive Care Unit Services During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Systematic Literature Review and Updated Experience from Shandong Province,"Xuan Song,Xinyan Liu,Ranran Dong,Katherine A Kummer,Chunting Wang,Xuan Song,Xinyan Liu,Ranran Dong,Katherine A Kummer,Chunting Wang","Background: While the use of telemedicine had been expanding before the initial outbreak of COVID-19, the pandemic has dramatically accelerated its implementation and expanded its usage in many hospitals. Tele-intensive care unit (ICU) is a specialized type of telemedicine that adapts available technologies to the unique needs of critically ill patients. We published an editorial in 2020 describing our initial experiences of Tele-ICU application in Shandong Province. Here, we update our insights gained over the past 2 years, and we provide a systematic review of the literature to compare our perspectives with those from other institutions. Methods: We performed a systematic literature review of publications describing the use of telemedicine in an ICU setting during COVID-19. The PubMed database was searched for studies published after January 1, 2020, which offered detailed descriptions of tele-ICU usage. Extracted data included details regarding tele-ICU technologies, descriptions of the institution, usage cases, assessments of tele-ICU effectiveness, and site-reported opinions (e.g., advantages, disadvantages). Results: We screened 162 studies resulting from the PubMed literature search, along with one expert recommendation. Of the 112 full-text articles retrieved, 11 were selected for inclusion in this qualitative summary. All were retrospective descriptions of tele-ICU experiences at a single site. Some pairs of included articles reported results from the same institution, with seven unique sites being described. Three sites employed centralized models of tele-ICU, while four allowed staff to participate from distant locations. Five sites collected user-reported feedback regarding tele-ICU. While the advantages and disadvantages described rarely overlapped directly between sites, many reported positive opinions of tele-ICU use overall. Conclusions: The potential applications of tele-ICU technologies vary widely, making them highly adaptable to the needs of individual institutions. Tele-ICU has proven invaluable to some hospitals during COVID-19 due to its effectiveness at aiding patient care while mitigating risk to health care workers.",COVID-19; critical care; tele-ICU; telemedicine.

Due to multipath propagation state of the art localization techniques provide only coarse position estimates. An approach to improve position estimates consists in hybrid localization, i.e., in combining several coarse position estimates to obtain one better position estimate. The position estimates to be combined can stem from different spatial measurements taken at the same time instant or from the same spatial measurement performed at different time instants.",localization; SPIDER; post-processing
1921,Artesunate Effect on Schistosome Thioredoxin Glutathione Reductase and Cytochrome c Peroxidase as New Molecular Targets in Schistosoma mansoni-infected Mice,"Abdin, Amany A.; Ashour, Dalia S.; Shoheib, Zeinab S.","Objective To investigate the possible effect of artesunate (ART) on schistosome thioredoxin glutathione reductase (TGR) and cytochrome c peroxidase (CcP) in Schistosoma mansoni-infected mice. Methods A total of 200 laboratory bred male Swiss albino mice were divided into 4 groups (50 mice in each group). Group I: infected untreated group (Control group) received a vehicle of 1% sodium carbonyl methylcellulose (CMC-Na); Group II: infected then treated with artesunate; Group III: infected then treated with praziquantel, and group IV: infected then treated with artesunate then praziquantel. Adult S. mansoni worms were collected by Animal Perfusion Method, tissue egg counted, TGR, and CcP mRNA Expression were estimated of in S. mansoni adult worms by semi-quantitative rt-PCR. Results Semi-quantitative rt-PCR values revealed that treatment with artesunate caused significant decrease in expression of schistosome TGR and CcP in comparison to the untreated group. In contrast, the treatment with praziquantel did not cause significant change in expression of these genes. The results showed more reduction in total worm and female worm count in combined ART-PZQ treated group than in monotherapy treated groups by either ART or PZQ. Moreover, complete disappearance (100%) of tissue eggs was recorded in ART-PZQ treated group with a respective reduction rate of 95.9% and 68.4% in ART- and PZQ-treated groups. Conclusion The current study elucidated for the first time that anti-schistosomal mechanisms of artesunate is mediated via reduction in expression of schistosome TGR and CcP. Linking these findings, addition of artesunate to praziquantel could achieve complete cure outcome in treatment of schistosomiasis.",Schistosomiasis; Artesunate; Praziquantel; Thioredoxin glutathione reductase; Cytochrome c peroxidase
1922,Data-Efficient Deep Reinforcement Learning for Attitude Control of Fixed-Wing UAVs: Field Experiments,"Bohn, Eivind; Coates, Erlend M.; Reinhardt, Dirk; Johansen, Tor Arne","Attitude control of fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) is a difficult control problem in part due to uncertain nonlinear dynamics, actuator constraints, and coupled longitudinal and lateral motions. Current state-of-the-art autopilots are based on linear control and are thus limited in their effectiveness and performance. drl is a machine learning method to automatically discover optimal control laws through interaction with the controlled system that can handle complex nonlinear dynamics. We show in this article that deep reinforcement learning (DRL) can successfully learn to perform attitude control of a fixed-wing UAV operating directly on the original nonlinear dynamics, requiring as little as 3 min of flight data. We initially train our model in a simulation environment and then deploy the learned controller on the UAV in flight tests, demonstrating comparable performance to the state-of-the-art ArduPlane proportional-integral-derivative (PID) attitude controller with no further online learning required. Learning with significant actuation delay and diversified simulated dynamics were found to be crucial for successful transfer to control of the real UAV. In addition to a qualitative comparison with the ArduPlane autopilot, we present a quantitative assessment based on linear analysis to better understand the learning controller's behavior.",Attitude control; Reinforcement learning; Data models; Computational modeling; Autonomous aerial vehicles; Aircraft; Vehicle dynamics; autonomous aerial vehicles; deep reinforcement learning (DRL); sim-to-real; soft actor-critic (SAC)
1923,A Novel Polar Space Random Field Model for the Detection of Glandular Structures,"Fu, Hao; Qiu, Guoping; Shu, Jie; Ilyas, Mohammad","In this paper, we propose a novel method to detect glandular structures in microscopic images of human tissue. We first convert the image from Cartesian space to polar space and then introduce a novel random field model to locate the possible boundary of a gland. Next, we develop a visual feature-based support vector regressor to verify if the detected contour corresponds to a true gland. And finally, we combine the outputs of the random field and the regressor to form the GlandVision algorithm for the detection of glandular structures. Our approach can not only detect the existence of the gland, but also can accurately locate it with pixel accuracy. In the experiments, we treat the task of detecting glandular structures as object (gland) detection and segmentation problems respectively. The results indicate that our new technique outperforms state-of-the-art computer vision algorithms in respective fields.",Gland; polar space; random field

The built-in electric field at the interface of a S-scheme heterojunction serves as the driving force for charge transfer, however, the poor interfacial contact greatly restricts the carrier migration rate. Herein, we synthesized the g-C3 N4 /Bi19 Br3 S27 S-scheme heterostructure through in situ deposition of Bi19 Br3 S27 (BBS) on porous g-C3 N4 (P-CN) nanosheets. The C-S bonds formed at the interface help to enhance the built-in electric field, thereby promoting the charge transfer and separation. As a result, the CO2 reduction reaction performance of 10 %Bi19 Br3 S27 /g-C3 N4 (BBS/P-CN) reaches 32.78 μmol g-1 h-1 , which is 341.4 and 18.7 times higher than that of pure BBS and P-CN, respectively. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) prove the presence of chemical bonds (C-S) between the P-CN and BBS. The S-scheme charge-transfer mechanism was analyzed via XPS and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. This work provides a new idea for designing heterojunction photocatalysts with interfacial chemical bonds to achieve high charge-transfer and catalytic activity.",Bi19Br3S27; CO2 photoreduction; S-scheme heterojunction; carbon nitride; interfacial chemical bonds.

J.","This article surveys emerging technologies related to pervasive edge computing (PEC) for industrial internet-of-things (IIoT) enabled by fifth-generation (5G) and beyond communication networks. PEC encompasses all devices that are capable of performing computational tasks locally, including those at the edge of the core network (edge servers co-located with 5G base stations) and in the radio access network (sensors, actuators, etc.). The main advantages of this paradigm are core network offloading (and benefits therefrom) and low latency for delay-sensitive applications (e.g., automatic control). We have reviewed the state-of-the-art in the PEC paradigm and its applications to the IIoT domain, which have been enabled by the recent developments in 5G technology. We have classified and described three important research areas related to PEC-distributed artificial intelligence methods, energy efficiency, and cyber security. We have also identified the main open challenges that must be solved to have a scalable PEC-based IIoT network that operates efficiently under different conditions. By explaining the applications, challenges, and opportunities, our paper reinforces the perspective that the PEC paradigm is an extremely suitable and important deployment model for industrial communication networks, considering the modern trend toward private industrial 5G networks with local operations and flexible management.",Cloud computing; Servers; Edge computing; 5G mobile communication; Task analysis; Bandwidth; Wireless communication; Edge computing; industrial Internet of Things; 5G network; energy efficiency; artificial intelligence; cyber security
1927,Three-dimensional virtual VR technology in environmental art design,"Wang, Yahong; Hu, Xiao-bing","More and more diversified environmental art design, combined with advanced 3-D virtual virtual reality (VR) technology, has made great contributions to the development of modern display design. The purpose of this study is to use the combination of modern technology and traditional art to realize the cohesion of traditional environmental art and promote the economic and cultural development of the city and society. This experiment uses 3D virtual reality virtual technology, which usually takes the form of wearing glasses. There's a screen in front of your eyes. The sound can be transmitted via speakers or acoustics, so that people have an exciting feeling. The application of virtual reality technology to environmental art must follow three principles: the principle of truth in content, the principle of application in form and the principle of the quantity checked. Taking into account the virtual environment art projection function and the degree of user appreciation and referring to the virtual implementation method evaluation indicator in reality, five indices are also formed, such as degree of interaction, degree of photography, degree of function, degree of use, and degree of extension. The experimental results show that the weights of fast and accurate indexes are 0.74 and 0.36, respectively. Virtual interaction technology presents unlimited possibilities, breaks through the narrow nature of traditional display mode, opens up the current real exhibition development space, and provides new thinking for the design of environmental art.",art design; environment design; simulation modeling; virtual reality technology

Circadian disruption has been identified to increase the risk of cancer and promote cancer progression, but the underlying mechanism remains unclear. And further mechanistic understanding of the crosstalk between clock components and cancer is urgent to achieve clinical anticancer benefits from chronochemotherapy. Recent studies discover that several nuclear receptors regulating circadian clock, also play crucial roles in mediating multiple cancer processes. In this review, we aim to summarize the latest developments of clock-related nuclear receptors in cancer biology and dissect mechanistic insights into how nuclear receptors coordinate with circadian clock to regulate tumorigenesis and cancer treatment. A better understanding of circadian clock-related nuclear receptors in cancer could help prevent tumorigenesis and improve anticancer efficacy.",cancer; circadian rhythm; clock; nuclear receptors.

Recent studies have revealed that miR-199a-5p participates in the process of myocardial I/R injury, but the precise roles and molecular mechanisms of miR-199a-5p in myocardial I/R injury remain not well-studied. Ferroptosis has been proposed to promote cardiomyocyte death, closely associated with myocardial I/R injury. Herein, the present study aimed to explore the function and mechanisms by which miR-199a-5p regulates whether miR-199a-5p contributes to ferroptosis-induced cardiomyocyte death responding to oxygen-glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R) injury, an in vitro model of myocardial I/R injury focusing on Akt/eNOS signaling pathway. The results found that ferroptosis-induced cardiomyocyte death occurs and is accompanied by an increase in miR-199a-5p level in OGD/R-treated H9c2 cells. MiR-199a-5p inhibitor ameliorated ferroptosis-induced cardiomyocyte death as evidenced by the increased cell viability, the reduced reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity, malondialdehyde (MDA) and Fe2+ contents, and the up-regulated glutathione (GSH)/glutathione disulphide (GSSG) ratio as well as glutathione peroxidase 4 (Gpx4) protein expression in H9c2 cells-exposed to OGD/R, while miR-199a-5p mimic had the opposite effects. In addition, OGD/R led to the inhibition of Akt/eNOS signaling pathway, which was also blocked by miR-199a-5p inhibitor and aggravated by miR-199a-5p mimic. Furthermore, LY294002, an inhibitor of Akt/eNOS signaling pathway, abrogated miR-199a-5p inhibitor-induced the reduction of ferroptosis-induced cardiomyocyte death. In summary, our findings demonstrated that miR-199a-5p plays a central role in stimulating ferroptosis-induced cardiomyocyte death during ischemic/hypoxic injury via inhibiting Akt/eNOS signaling pathway.",Akt/eNOS signaling pathway; cardiomyocyte death; ferroptosis; miR-199a-5p; myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury.
1930,Breaking the Bandwidth Barrier: Geometrical Adaptive Entropy Estimation,"Gao, Weihao; Oh, Sewoong; Viswanath, Pramod","Estimators of information theoretic measures, such as entropy and mutual information, are a basic workhorse for many downstream applications in modern data science. State-of-the-art approaches have been either geometric [nearest neighbor (NN)-based] or kernel-based (with a globally chosen bandwidth). In this paper, we combine both these approaches to design new estimators of entropy and mutual information that outperform the state-of-the-art methods. Our estimator uses local bandwidth choices of k-NN distances with a finite k, independent of the sample size. Such a local and data dependent choice ameliorates boundary bias and improves performance in practice, but the bandwidth is vanishing at a fast rate, leading to a non-vanishing bias. We show that the asymptotic bias of the proposed estimator is universal; it is independent of the underlying distribution. Hence, it can be precomputed and subtracted from the estimate. As a byproduct, we obtain a unified way of obtaining both the kernel and NN estimators. The corresponding theoretical contribution relating the asymptotic geometry of nearest neighbors to order statistics is of independent mathematical interest.",Information theory; nearest neighbor methods; information entropy; mutual information; density estimation robust algorithm

These problems are called hard problems due to their high complexity or high dimension. On the other hand, mataheuristics intends to seek a better solution to a problem. The Improvement Harmony Search algorithm is proposed under modification of the bandwidth parameter increasing the quality of the exploitation of the solutions. That is why within the state of the art, are mentioned several versions of harmonic search. The state of the art is supports the fact that the algorithm belongs to the category of those who make modifications to its parameters. This research demonstrates the ability of ImHS to solve a problem of high complexity focused on solving four-bar mechanism designs, whose solutions imply high dimension and which are also classified as hard problems. The two problems that are solved in this investigation, are problems very attacked within the state of the art by various metaheuristics. A comparison is then made against previous solutions with traditional metaheuristics and other versions of harmony search algorithm. Finally, the effectiveness of performance is demonstrated, where proposed algorithm it exceeded five metaheuristic algorithms and five harmony search versions. An optimum is provided in an easy and useful way, the parametric statistics are improved and the number of feasible solutions is exceeded in NP-hard problems as in the case of problems with four-bar mechanisms.",Harmonic analysis; Search problems; Bandwidth; Optimization; Heuristic algorithms; Benchmark testing; Convergence; Algorithms performance; four-bar mechanism; improved harmony search; optimization problems; mechatronic
1932,"Growth of desert varnish on petroglyphs from Jubbah and Shuwaymis, Ha'il region, Saudi Arabia","Macholdt, Dorothea S.; Al-Amri, Abdullah M.; Tuffaha, Husam T.; Jochum, Klaus Peter; Andreae, Meinrat O.","Petroglyphs, engraved throughout the Holocene into rock varnish coatings on sandstone, were investigated in the Ha'il region of northwestern Saudi Arabia, at Jabal Yatib, Jubbah, and Shuwaymis. The rock art has been created by removing the black varnish coating and thereby exposing the light sandstone underneath. With time, the varnish, a natural manganese (Mn)-rich coating, grows back. To study the rate of regrowth, we made 234 measurements by portable X-ray fluorescence (pXRF) on intact varnish and engraved petroglyphs. Since many petroglyphs can be assigned to a specific time period, a relationship between their ages and the Mn surface densities (D-Mn) of the regrown material could be derived. This relationship was improved by normalizing the D-Mn in the petroglyphs with the D-Mn of adjacent intact varnish. In turn, we used this relationship to assign a chronologic context to petroglyphs of unknown ages. Following the removal of the varnish by the artist and prior to the beginning of Mn oxyhydroxide regrowth, a thin Fe-rich film forms on the underlying rock. This initial Fe oxyhydroxide deposit may act as catalyst for subsequent fast Mn oxidation. After a few decades of relatively rapid growth, the regrowth of the Mn-rich varnish slows down to about 0.017 mu g cm(-2) a(-1) Mn, corresponding to about 0.012% a(-1) Mn of the intact varnish density, or about 1.2 nm a(-1), presumably due to a change of the catalytic process. Our results suggest that petroglyphs were engraved almost continuously since the pre-Neolithic period, and that rock varnish growth seems to proceed roughly linear, without detectable influences of the regional Holocene climatic changes.",manganese oxyhydroxides; Neolithic period; portable XRF; rock art; rock varnish; varnish growth mechanisms
1933,Challenges and Opportunities of Using a National Database to Evaluate Racial/Ethnic Disparities and Breastfeeding Effects on Sudden Unexpected Infant Death,"Sera Yoo,Menaka Dhingra,John Gaughan,Saba Daneshpooy,Nikhil B Bhana,Melissa C Bartick,Lori Feldman-Winter,Sera Yoo,Menaka Dhingra,John Gaughan,Saba Daneshpooy,Nikhil B Bhana,Melissa C Bartick,Lori Feldman-Winter","Background: Sudden unexpected infant death (SUID) rates remain higher in American Indian/Alaska Native (AI/AN) and non-Hispanic Black (NHB) infants than other demographic groups. Racial disparities are also evident in breastfeeding, which is associated with reduced risk of SUID. Objective: To assess the relationship between racial/ethnic disparities in SUID and breastfeeding beyond the newborn period using U.S. nationally reported public databases. Methods: Data were extracted from Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Wide-ranging Online Data for Epidemiologic Research (WONDER) and the National Immunization Surveys (NISs) 2009-2017. WONDER data were restricted to full-term infants and sorted by death year, race/ethnicity, and other characteristics. NIS breastfeeding data included ever breastfed, breastfed at 6 months, and exclusive breastfeeding at 3 and 6 months. Breastfeeding rates and mortality data were aggregated based on race/ethnicity, and mortality rates were analyzed by weighted (number of births) multivariable linear regression. Results: SUID rates were highest among NHB and AI/AN infants who also had the lowest breastfeeding rates. When breastfeeding and race/ethnicity were included in the analyses, race/ethnicity confounded the relationship between breastfeeding and SUID. When race was excluded, ever breastfeeding and any breastfeeding at 6 months were associated with significantly decreased SUID rates. Conclusion: Race/ethnicity confounded the relationship between breastfeeding and SUID. Analysis was limited because individual SUID rates were available for maternal/birth characteristics but not for breastfeeding. Our study showed a need for adding additional data points to other national databases to better understand the role that breastfeeding plays in the racial/ethnic disparities in SUID.",breastfeeding; infant mortality; socioeconomic factors; sudden unexpected infant death.

1935,Contralaterally Enhanced Networks for Thoracic Disease Detection,"Zhao, Gangming; Fang, Chaowei; Li, Guanbin; Jiao, Licheng; Yu, Yizhou","Identifying and locating diseases in chest X-rays are very challenging, due to the low visual contrast between normal and abnormal regions, and distortions caused by other overlapping tissues. An interesting phenomenon is that there exist many similar structures in the left and right parts of the chest, such as ribs, lung fields and bronchial tubes. This kind of similarities can be used to identify diseases in chest X-rays, according to the experience of broad-certificated radiologists. Aimed at improving the performance of existing detection methods, we propose a deep end-to-end module to exploit the contralateral context information for enhancing feature representations of disease proposals. First of all, under the guidance of the spine line, the spatial transformer network is employed to extract local contralateral patches, which can provide valuable context information for disease proposals. Then, we build up a specific module, based on both additive and subtractive operations, to fuse the features of the disease proposal and the contralateral patch. Our method can be integrated into both fully and weakly supervised disease detection frameworks. It achieves 33.17 AP50 on a carefully annotated private chest X-ray dataset which contains 31,000 images. Experiments on the NIH chest X-ray dataset indicate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in weakly-supervised disease localization.",Diseases; Proposals; X-rays; Feature extraction; Location awareness; Lung; Training; Chest X-ray; disease detection; contralateral context; deep learning

The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of ND and RTX on flap perfusion as a critical factor for flap success. Overall, 392 patients reconstructed with a microvascular fasciocutaneous flap (FF) or perforator flap (PF) in the head and neck region between 2011 and 2020 were analysed retrospectively. Flap perfusion measured intraoperatively and postoperatively with the O2C tissue oxygen analysis system was compared between patients who had received neither ND nor RTX (controls), patients who had received ND but no RTX (ND group), and patients who had received both ND and RTX (ND+RTX group). Intraoperative and postoperative flap blood flow was decreased in FFs in ND group patients compared to controls (median 66.3 AU vs 86.0 AU, P = 0.023; median 73.5 AU vs 93.8 AU, P = 0.045, respectively). In the multivariable analysis, these differences showed a tendency to persist (P = 0.052 and P = 0.056). Flap success rates were similar in control patients, ND patients, and ND+RTX patients (98.7%, 94.0%, and 97.6%, respectively). Flap perfusion is not reduced in FFs and PFs in patients who have undergone ND or ND and RTX. This indicates that neck dissection and neck irradiation should not be contraindications for microvascular free flap reconstruction.",Free tissue flaps; Neck dissection; Perfusion; Radiotherapy; Reconstructive surgical procedures.
1937,VOC exposures in a mixed-use university art building,"Ryan, TJ; Hart, EM; Kappler, LL","Despite a sizable educational art enterprise in the United States there is a dearth of rigorously performed studies of exposures to persons engaged in such activities. Exposures to 45 EPA-designated volatile organic compounds were examined in printmakers in a mixed-use university art school served by a 100% exhausted mechanical ventilation system. Personal exposures (n=90) were compared with area concentrations (n=36) in the studio area and at a second location at the same facility. For personal exposure assessments a cohort of 12 students wore passive dosimeters twice weekly over a 6-week period. Numerous compounds were found, the most prevalent being toluene at an average concentration of 64.6 mug/m(3) (17.1 ppb; range <1-319 ppb); 1,1,1, trichloroethane at 40.5 mug/m(3) (7.5 ppb; range <11-211 ppb); xylenes at 8.0 mug/m(3) (1.8 ppb; range <1-43 ppb); 1,3,5-trimethyl benzene at 6.2 mug/m(3) (1.3 ppb; range <.3-32 ppb); propyl benzene at 5.0 mug/m(3) (1.0 ppb; range <.5-27 ppb); methylene chloride at 4.9 mug/m(3) (1.4 ppb; range <1-10 ppb); and ethyl benzene at 4.5 mug/m(3) (1.1 ppb; range <.4-23 ppb). Personal exposures were considerably higher than average area air concentrations, with the exception of methylene chloride concentrations, which were five times higher at the print cleaning operation. Floors where solvents were not used had no detectable exposures (typical lower limit of detection 1 ppb) and were free of solvent odors. Despite frequent solvent contact with skin, personal protective equipment was seldom used. Results indicate that in mixed-use facilities such as this, nonrecirculating general ventilation systems can effectively eliminate indoor air quality issues between floors, despite perceptible odors on solvent use floors. For total exposure assessments in such processes, contact exposures from printmaking solvents during cleaning procedures are a potentially important consideration.",art; indoor air quality; organic vapor monitor; printmaking; total volatile organic compounds; volatile organic compounds

Propolis, a honeybee-produced naturopathic formulation, is an available, affordable, and safe example of such remedies with different content according to its geographic location. Findings regarding the protective properties of this resinous substance across numerous pathological conditions are promising. Although the anti-tumor effects of propolis from different origins have been explored to some degree, yet there is no study on the effects of Kermanian propolis in the treatment of hematologic malignancies. Accordingly, the objective of the present experiment was to divulge the anti-tumor potential of this bioactive substance both as monotherapy and in combination with doxorubicin against an acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell line (NALM-6).The viability of cells treated with Kermanian propolis (5-500 μg/mL) and doxorubicin (5-100 μg/mL) was analyzed during 72 h. Based on the MTT results, the best incubation time, IC50 concentrations, and finally the cytotoxicity of the combination therapy were ascertained. Next, the apoptotic rate and expression of apoptosis-related genes (Bcl-2 and Bax) were assessed in mono and combination therapies using flow cytometry and real-time PCR assays, respectively. Kermanian propolis and doxorubicin have impressive tumor-suppressing activity in a dose-dependent manner (IC50 concentrations: 100 and 40 μg/mL respectively). The best incubation time was considered 48 h. For the combination approach, 50 and 10 μg/mL were determined as optimum concentrations of the compounds. The selected concentrations induced notable apoptosis in the studied cells through significant (P < 0.01) upregulation of Bax/Bcl-2 level. The present study clearly suggests that Kermanian propolis, as an adjunct treatment option, has a promising apoptosis-induced cell death potential in the NALM-6 cell line.",Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL); Bax/Bcl-2 ratio; Doxorubicin; Kermanian propolis; NALM-6.
1939,Improving Human Pose Estimation With Self-Attention Generative Adversarial Networks,"Wang, Xiangyang; Cao, Zhongzheng; Wang, Rui; Liu, Zhi; Zhu, Xiaoqiang","Human pose estimation in images is challenging and important for many computer vision applications. Large improvements in human pose estimation have been achieved with the development of convolutional neural networks. Even though, when encountered some difficult cases even the state-of-the-art models may fail to predict all the body joints correctly. Some recent works try to refine the pose estimator. GAN (Generative Adversarial Networks) has been proved to be efficient to improve human pose estimation. However, GAN can only learn local body joints structural constrains. In this paper, we propose to apply Self-Attention GAN to further improve the performance of human pose estimation. With attention mechanism in the framework of GAN, we can learn long-range body joints dependencies, therefore enforce the entire body joints structural constrains to make all the body joints to be consistent. Our method outperforms other state-of-the-art methods on two standard benchmark datasets MPII and LSP for human pose estimation.",Human pose estimation; convolutional neural networks; stacked hourglass networks; self-attention GAN

We tackle a specifically challenging problem, where training labels are noisy and highly sparse. U-LanD builds upon a pivotal observation: a deep Bayesian landmark detector solely trained on key video frames, has significantly lower predictive uncertainty on those frames vs. other frames in videos. We use this observation as an unsupervised signal to automatically recognize key frames on which we detect landmarks. As a test-bed for our framework, we use ultrasound imaging videos of the heart, where sparse and noisy clinical labels are only available for a single frame in each video. Using data from 4,493 patients, we demonstrate that U-LanD can exceedingly outperform the state-of-the-art non-Bayesian counterpart by a noticeable absolute margin of 42% in R-2 score, with almost no overhead imposed on the model size.",Deep learning; echocardiography; landmark detection; sparse training labels; uncertainty estimation; video analysis
1941,Investigating the energy-environmental Kuznets curve under panel quantile regression: a global perspective,"Muhammad Iftikhar Ul Husnain,Sisay Demissew Beyene,Kentaka Aruga,Muhammad Iftikhar Ul Husnain,Sisay Demissew Beyene,Kentaka Aruga","Energy is regarded as an engine of economic growth and an important ingredient of human survival and development, but it can lead to deterioration of environmental quality. The study investigates the energy environmental Kuznets curve (EEKC) during the 1990-2017 period for 144 countries using models for total energy, renewable energy, and non-renewable energy consumptions. We employ panel mean and quantile regressions, accounting for individual and distributional heterogeneities. It is found that the EEKC sustains among the higher middle-income countries while it cannot be verified at some lower-income quantiles due to the heterogeneous nature of the different groups of countries. The relationship between economic growth, total energy, and non-renewable energy consumption is positive and non-linear. The quantile estimations revealed mixed (positive and non-linear, inverted U-shape, U-shape, and N-shape) EEKC. The maximum and minimum turning values of GDP per capita for total energy consumption (is 43,201.58 and 89,630.49), for renewable energy consumption (53,535.07 and 89,869.41), and for non-renewable energy consumption (42,188.16 and 89,487.71). Urbanization and population growth had positive impacts on energy consumption while these effects become more significant as moving from low to high-income quantiles. The study implies that while the developed nations can adopt energy-efficient policies without compromising on the growth momentum and environment, this might be not recommended for the developing nations and it would be preferable for these countries to ""grow first and clean up later."" The study indicates the importance of the developed nations to support the developing countries to achieve economic growth along the EEKC by transferring energy-efficient technologies.",Energy; Environment; Environmental Kuznets curve; Population growth; Quantile regression; Urbanization.
1942,Fast CNN Stereo Depth Estimation through Embedded GPU Devices,"Aguilera, Cristhian A.; Aguilera, Cristhian; Navarro, Cristobal A.; Sappa, Angel D.","Current CNN-based stereo depth estimation models can barely run under real-time constraints on embedded graphic processing unit (GPU) devices. Moreover, state-of-the-art evaluations usually do not consider model optimization techniques, being that it is unknown what is the current potential on embedded GPU devices. In this work, we evaluate two state-of-the-art models on three different embedded GPU devices, with and without optimization methods, presenting performance results that illustrate the actual capabilities of embedded GPU devices for stereo depth estimation. More importantly, based on our evaluation, we propose the use of a U-Net like architecture for postprocessing the cost-volume, instead of a typical sequence of 3D convolutions, drastically augmenting the runtime speed of current models. In our experiments, we achieve real-time inference speed, in the range of 5-32 ms, for 1216 x 368 input stereo images on the Jetson TX2, Jetson Xavier, and Jetson Nano embedded devices.",stereo matching; deep learning; embedded GPU

Response facilitation is a mechanism of social influence whereby observing a demonstrator performing a behavior temporarily increases the probability that the observer will perform the same behavior. We focused on stone handling (SH) behavior, a form of object-directed play routinely displayed by free-ranging long-tailed macaques (Macaca fascicularis) in Ubud, Bali, Indonesia. We tested whether the expression of SH was subject to dyadic response facilitation. We compared video-recorded focal samples of an individual immediately after they had witnessed a SH bout performed by a conspecific, and matched-control focal samples of the same witness in the absence of any surrounding SH bouts. We found converging evidence that SH was facilitated within pairs of individuals. First, SH occurred significantly more often and lasted significantly longer in the post-witnessing condition than in the matched-control condition. Second, a monkey initiated SH more rapidly in the former than in the latter, and this significant facilitation effect mainly occurred during the first two minutes after witnessing SH. By demonstrating that the expression of SH was socially mediated, we provided further support for the cultural nature of this behavior.",Behavioral contagion; Macaca fascicularis; Material culture; Neighbor effect; Social influence; Stone handling.

The INCOSE systems engineering handbook indicates that system complexity is one of the seven key challenges influencing development when engineering a system of systems. The scope of this paper is first to survey systems engineering relevant definitions of complexity for latter application to the complexity evaluation framework. The literature search also includes state-of-the-art works on system complexity measurement. Before proposing new techniques, the current complexity-based system, and interface measurement and design techniques are explored. As the state-of-the-art only includes static/ structural complexity quantification, entropy-based measures for dynamic complexity quantification are proposed. A sample system is evaluated using the proposed dynamic complexity measures and the results are discussed.

An example is diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (diffusion MRI), a non-invasive microstructure assessment method with a prominent application in neuroimaging. Advanced diffusion models providing accurate microstructural characterization so far have required long acquisition times and thus have been inapplicable for children and adults who are uncooperative, uncomfortable, or unwell. We show that the long scan time requirements are mainly due to disadvantages of classical data processing. We demonstrate how deep learning, a group of algorithms based on recent advances in the field of artificial neural networks, can be applied to reduce diffusion MRI data processing to a single optimized step. This modification allows obtaining scalar measures from advanced models at twelve-fold reduced scan time and detecting abnormalities without using diffusion models. We set a new state of the art by estimating diffusion kurtosis measures from only 12 data points and neurite orientation dispersion and density measures from only 8 data points. This allows unprecedentedly fast and robust protocols facilitating clinical routine and demonstrates how classical data processing can be streamlined by means of deep learning.",Artificial neural networks; diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI); diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (diffusion MRI); neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging (NODDI)

Based on this observation, we investigate whether significant shifts in value priorities according to the Shalom Schwartz scale took place in Austria in the period May 2020 to March/April 2021. The first two waves of the Values in Crisis panel study serve as data material. Two theoretical assumptions are central to the interpretation of the results: first, the thesis of a trend toward conservatism and second, the thesis of the effective power of political discourses in times of (re)emerging populism. The article also pays special attention to a methodological discussion of changes in the meaning of questionnaire items due to the COVID-19 pandemic.The empirical analyses confirm a clear stability of value orientations. Above all, the value of conformity has changed, becoming more important for a significant part of the population; at the same time, the desire for a hedonistic lifestyle lost some of its importance. Conformity became more important, particularly for voters of the governing political parties, while this trend was not apparent, especially among voters of the FPÖ. Since the observed shift in value priorities mainly concerns ""pandemic-sensitive"" value dimensions, the results suggest a short-term reaction to the crisis rather than a long-term change in values.",Conformity; Conservatism; Corona crisis; Value change; Values in Crisis Study.

In the proposed method, the PAN image is decomposed into three layers: A strong edge layer, a detail layer, and a low-frequency layer. The edge layer and detail layer are then injected into the MS image by a proportional injection model. In addition, two new quantitative evaluation indices, including the modified correlation coefficient (MCC) and the modified universal image quality index (MUIQI) are developed.

Interestingly, some microbes remarkably enriched GH genes of this family, with the reason unknown. Hungateiclostridium clariflavum DSM 19,732 is an efficient lignocellulose degrader, which harbors up to 7 GH43 genes in its genome. We cloned three of the seven GH43 genes, and found that Abn43A is a unique endoarabinanase, which unprecedently showed approximately two times larger activity on sugar beet arabinan (116.8 U/mg) than that on linear arabinan, and it is efficient in arabinooligosaccharide production. Abn43B is an exoarabinanase which directly releases arabinose from linear arabinan. Abn43C is an α-L-arabinofuranosidase which is capable of splitting the arabinose side-chains from arabinooligosaccharides, arabinoxylooligosaccharides, and arabinoxylan. Most importantly, the three GH43 enzymes synergized in hydrolyzing arabinan. Compared to Abn43B alone, a supplement of Abn43A increased the arabinose production from linear arabinan by 150%, reaching 0.44 g/g arabinan. Moreover, an addition of Abn43C to Abn43A and Abn43B boosted the arabinose production from sugar beet arabinan by 15 times, reaching 0.262 g/g arabinan. Our work suggested the intensified functions of multiple GH43 enzymes toward arabinan degradation in H. clariflavum, and a potential synergetic mechanism among the three GH43 enzymes is suggested. KEY POINTS: • Endoarabinanase GH43A prefers branched substrate to linear one • Exoarabinanase GH43B can directly release arabinose from linear arabinan • The three GH43 enzymes synergized in arabinan hydrolysis.",Arabinan; GH43; Glycoside hydrolase; Hungateiclostridium clariflavum.

However, due to the limited number of photons and the counting rate in the corresponding spectral segment, the reconstructed spectral images are usually affected by severe noise. In this paper, we propose a fourth-order nonlocal tensor decomposition model for spectral CT image reconstruction (FONT-SIR). To maintain the original spatial relationships among similar patches and improve the imaging quality, similar patches without vectorization are grouped in both spectral and spatial domains simultaneously to form the fourth-order processing tensor unit. The similarity of different patches is measured with the cosine similarity of latent features extracted using principal component analysis (PCA). By imposing the constraints of the weighted nuclear and total variation (TV) norms, each fourth-order tensor unit is decomposed into a low-rank component and a sparse component, which can efficiently remove noise and artifacts while preserving the structural details. Moreover, the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) is employed to solve the decomposition model. Extensive experimental results on both simulated and real data sets demonstrate that the proposed FONT-SIR achieves superior qualitative and quantitative performance compared with several state-of-the-art methods.",Tensors; Computed tomography; Image reconstruction; Photonics; Correlation; X-ray imaging; Principal component analysis; Spectral CT; iterative reconstruction; tensor decomposition; nuclear norm

An accurate alignment between the 3-D and 2-D images is a prerequisite for fusion applications. This paper presents a dynamic rigid 2-D/3-D registration framework, which measures the local 3-D-to-2-D misalignment and efficiently constrains the update of both planar and non-planar 3-D rigid transformations using a novel point-to-plane correspondence model. In the simulation evaluation, the proposed method achieved a mean 3-D accuracy of 0.07 mm for the head phantom and 0.05 mm for the thorax phantom using single-view X-ray images. In the evaluation on dynamic motion compensation, our method significantly increases the accuracy comparing with the baseline method. The proposed method is also evaluated on a publicly-available clinical angiogram data set with ""gold-standard"" registrations. The proposed method achieved a mean 3-D accuracy below 0.8 mm and a mean 2-D accuracy below 0.3 mm using single-view X-ray images.

The baseline Cox model included the traditional risk factors and current systolic BP to predict 20-year risk of CVD (643 events). Current systolic BP was significant, and the associated hazard ratio was 1.09 for 10 mm Hg (confidence interval [CI] 95%: 1.04-1.15).

So far only two studies have explored FD at atmospheric pressure or even superatmospheric pressure, respectively. This work pursues ion desorption from 13-µm activated tungsten emitters at atmospheric pressure. The emitters are positioned in front of the atmospheric pressure interface of a Fourier transform-ion cyclotron resonance (FT-ICR) mass spectrometer and the entrance electrode of the interface is set to 3-5 kV with respect to the emitter. Under these conditions positive, and for the first time, negative ion desorption is achieved. In either polarity, atmospheric pressure field desorption (APFD) is robust and spectra are reproducible. Both singly charged positive and negative ions formed by these processes are characterized by accurate mass-based formula assignments and in part by tandem mass spectrometry. The compounds analyzed include the ionic liquids trihexyl(tetradecyl) phosphonium tris(pentafluoroethyl) trifluorophosphate) and 1-butyl-1-methylpyrrolidinium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide, the acidic compounds perfluorononanoic acid and polyethylene glycol diacid, as well as two amino-terminated polypropylene glycols.

There exists a compromise between localizing the objects and estimating their viewpoints. The detector ideally needs to be view-invariant, while the pose estimation process should be able to generalize towards the category-level. This work is an exploration of using deep learning models for solving both problems simultaneously. For doing so, we propose three novel deep learning architectures, which are able to perform a joint detection and pose estimation, where we gradually decouple the two tasks. We also investigate whether the pose estimation problem should be solved as a classification or regression problem, being this still an open question in the computer vision community. We detail a comparative analysis of all our solutions and the methods that currently define the state of the art for this problem.

Anthropogenic particles, including microplastics and semi-synthetic cellulosic fibres, are prolific marine pollutants that are readily consumed by marine organisms, including small pelagic fish commonly used in fishmeal. Conversely, there is no indication plants can accumulate anthropogenic microparticles. We explore whether aquaculture feed presents a route of contamination for farmed fish. Commercially-sourced aquaculture feedstocks, including fishmeals and soybean meal, were processed (KOH digestion and ZnCl2 density separation) and anthropogenic particles characterised using microscopy and spectroscopic methods. Both fishmeal and soybean meals contained anthropogenic particles, with concentrations ranging 1070-2000 particles kg-1. The prevalence of anthropogenic particles in plant-based feeds indicates that the majority of contamination occurs post-harvest.

Converging theoretical and experimental evidence indicates that cortical circuits generating self-sustained dynamics operate in an inhibition-stabilized regime. Theoretical work has established that four sets of weights (WE←E, WE←I, WI←E, and WI←I) must obey specific relationships to produce inhibition-stabilized dynamics, but it is not known how the brain can appropriately set the values of all four weight classes in an unsupervised manner to be in the inhibition-stabilized regime. We prove that standard homeostatic plasticity rules are generally unable to generate inhibition-stabilized dynamics and that their instability is caused by a signature property of inhibition-stabilized networks: the paradoxical effect. In contrast, we show that a family of ""cross-homeostatic"" rules overcome the paradoxical effect and robustly lead to the emergence of stable dynamics.

Adult learners are identified as being of productive age in engaging with multiple commitments, including studying. The multiple engagements make managing their time and focus difficult, contributing to a high institutional dropout rate. This situation has reduced the number of highly skilled and professional workers in the country because of the failure to meet academic requirements. In the current digital world, every aspect of education includes some technology elements. However, most adult learners are reluctant to utilize mobile technology for learning. Therefore, this review paper aims to provide state of the art on mobile learning (m-Learning) for adult learners. Considering a set of inclusion and exclusion criteria, 135 related articles from IEEE, Google Scholar, Springer Link, Science Direct, Taylor and Francis, and Wiley digital databases were extracted and reviewed. State of the art were discussed in terms of functions of m-Learning, effectiveness, and m-Learning as a tool. Keywords from articles were extracted and the taxonomy of m-Learning was discussed under five classifications (behavioural intention, technological support, educational content, learner coordination, and instructional design), representing the same meaning and features discussed in the articles. The findings can raise awareness among mobile learning practitioners to provide more effective services for adult learners. Meanwhile, higher education institutions can be better redesigned in terms of pedagogy to fit the needs of adult learners with mobile learning.",Education; Mobile learning; Older adults; Taxonomy; Information technology; Performance evaluation; Electronic learning; Behavioral sciences; m-Learning; adult learner; andragogy; acceptance; intention
1963,Building Resilience: An Art-Food Hub to Connect Local Communities,"Quaranta, Giovanni; Dalia, Cristina; Salvati, Luca; Salvia, Rosanna","Resilience thinking is an appropriate framework when assessing the transitional potential of complex urban systems. The transformation of abandoned spaces into local hubs attracting new and innovative activities and events promotes a socioeconomic renaissance in urban communities, by stimulating adaptation to change, enhancing local resilience and strengthening urban-rural links.

The transformation of an abandoned building into an 'Art-Food Hub'-a multi-purpose and creative cultural space-based on resilience thinking was the specific case analyzed in our study. Appropriate stakeholders were identified and involved in a series of field activities and workshops, with the final objective of informing a comprehensive strategy strengthening awareness to change and capacity building. More specifically, stakeholder involvement was carried out with two aims: first, to make stakeholders active participants in co-designing a Strategic Urban Planning Document for Battipaglia and, second, to evaluate to what extent the proposed initiative contributes to building local resilience. By explicitly considering cross-scale drivers of community resilience, the results of this study show how the concept of resilience can be practically applied to policy formulation and implementation.",resilience; food; rural development; food/arts nexus; urban-rural linkages
1964,Lightweight Single Image Super-Resolution With Multi-Scale Spatial Attention Networks,"Soh, Jae Woong; Cho, Nam Ik","Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) generally provide higher performance gain for single image super-resolution (SISR) as the depth and number of parameters are increasing. However, just increasing the layers of straightforward deep networks has a problem that it requires an impractically large number of parameters for obtaining state-of-the-art performance. Instead, some researchers proposed lightweight networks, which is designed with more sophisticated network structures for achieving better performance than the straightforward networks at the same parameter requirement. In this paper, we propose new lightweight Multi-scale Spatial Attention Networks (MSAN) for SISR, which attempt to bring out a better performance from the relatively small number of parameters. Specifically, we adopt a dense connection with feature fusion layers to broadcast abundant features to every level of layers, and propose a double residual structure that provides an additional skip-connection. We also design a Multi-scale Spatial Attention Block (MSAB) to exploit multi-scale spatial contextual information. Furthermore, we introduce a spatial attention module which adaptively focuses on the most informative feature scale in a given region of the image. In the experiments, we validate that the proposed MSAN achieves significant accuracy compared to recent lightweight models and comparable performance to the state-of-the-art methods.",Feature extraction; Convolution; Spatial resolution; Computer architecture; Training; Convolutional neural networks; Convolutional neural network (CNN); lightweight; multi-scale spatial attention; single image super-resolution (SISR)
1965,A quick eye to anger: An investigation of a differential effect of facial features in detecting angry and happy expressions,"L Y Lo,M Y Cheng,L Y Lo,M Y Cheng","Detection of angry and happy faces is generally found to be easier and faster than that of faces expressing emotions other than anger or happiness. This can be explained by the threatening account and the feature account. Few empirical studies have explored the interaction between these two accounts which are seemingly, but not necessarily, mutually exclusive. The present studies hypothesised that prominent facial features are important in facilitating the detection process of both angry and happy expressions; yet the detection of happy faces was more facilitated by the prominent features than angry faces. Results confirmed the hypotheses and indicated that participants reacted faster to the emotional expressions with prominent features (in Study 1) and the detection of happy faces was more facilitated by the prominent feature than angry faces (in Study 2). The findings are compatible with evolutionary speculation which suggests that the angry expression is an alarming signal of potential threats to survival. Compared to the angry faces, the happy faces need more salient physical features to obtain a similar level of processing efficiency.",Emotional expression; Prominent feature; Threatening.
1966,Forest cover resilience to climate change over India using the MC2 dynamic vegetation model,"Pulakesh Das,Mukunda Dev Behera,Prasad K Bhaskaran,Parth Sarathi Roy,Pulakesh Das,Mukunda Dev Behera,Prasad K Bhaskaran,Parth Sarathi Roy","It is imperative to understand the climate change impact on the forest ecosystem to develop appropriate mitigation and management strategies. We have employed a process-based dynamic vegetation modeling (MAPSS-CENTURY: MC) approach to project change in vegetation life forms under projected climate conditions that attained 81% overall accuracy. The present and projected climate conditions suggested highly resilient/stable forest covers in wet climate regimes and moderately resilient in dry semi-arid regions. Several forested grids in the seasonally dry tropical forest in the Eastern Ghats and dry Deccan peninsula regions are estimated to be less resilient, which may experience a regime shift toward scrub and grassland. The future prediction demonstrated an upward temperature shift in the Western Himalayas and trans-Himalaya, which may facilitate forest spread at higher elevations. Although the forest cover resilience may increase in future climate conditions, the disturbances in several regions in the Deccan Peninsula and the Eastern Ghats may trigger forest to scrub and grassland transition. The inaccuracy in model simulation in the Western Himalayas could be attributed to coarse resolution grids (0.5°) failing to resolve the narrow climate niches. The spatially explicit model simulation provides opportunities to develop long-term climate change adaptation and conservation strategies.",Climate projection; Elevational shift; Leaf area index; Net primary productivity; Vegetation life form.
1967,The Shigir idol in the context of early art in Eurasia,"Terberger, Thomas; Zhilin, Mikhail; Savchenko, Svetlana","In 1890 the so called ""Shigir Idol"" was found in a peat bog and for a long time discussion on the dating of the wooden sculpture was going on. In the 1990s first conventional radiocarbon dates suggested a Mesolithic context, but a series of recent AMS-results date the object close to the beginning of the Holocene (c. 10,000 calBC). The surprisingly early date makes the find the earliest monumental wooden sculpture of the world. A direct parallel is not available and this hampers the interpretation and contextualization of the find. Here we discuss the find according to aspects such as wood working and the type of sculpture and decoration in the Late Palaeolithic to Early Mesolithic context of Eurasia. We can show that there is a long tradition of wood working since the Lower Palaeolithic and the very limited evidence of wooden objects from the Palaeolithic and Mesolithic is due to preservation conditions. Anthropomorphic figures are sometimes present in Late Glacial art and less anthropomorphic representations are available from the Early Mesolithic. The geometric patterns of the Shigir sculpture such as simple lines and zigzag-ornaments are common elements of Late Palaeolithic and Early Mesolithic decoration. In conclusion the different elements of the Shigir sculpture fit better to the record of Late Glacial to Early Mesolithic art in Eurasia than expected. We see this as a confirmation of the early date of the monumental sculpture. The figure demonstrates a complex expression of symbolic behavior and art of hunter-gatherers at that time. The only general parallel of monumental anthropomorphic figures from that time can be mentioned from the far distant Gobekli Tepe site in eastern Anatolia.",Shigir idol; Early monumental art; Geometric decoration; Late glacial; Early mesolithic
1968,A Comparative Study of Self-Supervised Speech Representation Based Voice Conversion,"Huang, Wen-Chin; Yang, Shu-Wen; Hayashi, Tomoki; Toda, Tomoki","We present a large-scale comparative study of self-supervised speech representation (S3R)-based voice conversion (VC). In the context of recognition-synthesis VC, S3Rs are attractive owing to their potential to replace expensive supervised representations such as phonetic posteriorgrams (PPGs), which are commonly adopted by state-of-the-art VC systems. Using S3PRL-VC, an open-source VC software we previously developed, we provide a series of in-depth objective and subjective analyses under three VC settings: intra-/cross-lingual any-to-one (A2O) and any-to-any (A2A) VC, using the voice conversion challenge 2020 (VCC2020) dataset. We investigated S3R-based VC in various aspects, including model type, multilinguality, and supervision. We also studied the effect of a post-discretization process with k-means clustering and showed how it improves in the A2A setting. Finally, the comparison with state-of-the-art VC systems demonstrates the competitiveness of S3R-based VC and also sheds light on the possible improving directions.",Speech recognition; Task analysis; Training; Hidden Markov models; Synthesizers; Feature extraction; Phonetics; Self-supervised learning; self-supervised speech representation; voice conversion

We focus on approaches that predict the occupancy state of a home using occupancy schedules - that is, past records of the occupancy state. We ran our analysis on actual occupancy schedules covering several months for 45 homes. Our results show that state-of-the-art, schedule-based occupancy prediction algorithms achieve an overall prediction accuracy of over 80%. We also show that the performance of these algorithms is close to the theoretical upper bound expressed by the predictability of the input schedules. Building upon these results, we used ISO 13790-standard modelling techniques to analyse the energy savings that can be achieved by smart heating controllers that use occupancy predictors. Furthermore, we investigated the trade-off between achievable savings (typically 6-17% on average) and the risk Of comfort loss for household residents. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The design exhibits dual circular polarization contrary to dual linear polarization of state-of-the-art feeds. It covers the required ultrawideband (UWB) from 2 to 14 GHz with an almost constant and real input impedance which facilitates the design of the feeding structure and the low-noise amplifiers (LNAs). Different versions are investigated for enhancing feed performance, ensuring higher aperture efficiencies and mechanical stability. The simulation results of the reflector loaded by the proposed feed show an aperture efficiency of 65% +/- 5% with a noise antenna temperature around 14 K and a system equivalent flux density (SEFD) of about 1300 Jy, both averaged over the required bandwidth at zenith. Measurements of the single-element and the four-element feeds are presented.

1971,Exploring approximations in 4-and 8-point DTT hardware architectures for low-power image compression,"Paim, Guilherme; Santana, Gustavo Madeira; Giacomini Rocha, Leandro Mateus; Soares, Leonardo Bandeira; Cesar da Costa, Eduardo Antonio; Bampi, Sergio","Due to the intensive use of discrete transforms in picture coding, the search for fast and power-efficient approaches for their hardware implementation gains importance. The Discrete Tchebichef Transform (DTT) represents a discrete class of the Chebyshev orthogonal polynomials, and it is an alternative for the Discrete Cosine Transform, commonly used in picture coding. High energy compaction and decorrelation are the main properties of the DTT. The state-of-the-art approximate DTT matrix is composed of 0, 1, -1, 2, and -2 coefficient values. In this work, we propose a new approximation for both the 4-point and 8-point integer DTT with better quality and power-efficiency. We explore the effects of coefficient truncation, whose values are 1/16, -1/16, 1/8, -1/8, 1/4, and -1/4. Considering operations with integers, the smaller values of coefficients causes truncation in the internal transform calculations and leads to smaller values for the non-diagonal residues, which reduces the non-orthogonality. We have also selectively pruned the rows of the state-of-the-art approximate DTT matrix. The results show that the proposed pruned approximate DTT hardwired solutions increases the maximum frequency up to 5%, minimizes circuit area by over 30%, with savings of up to 32.4% in power dissipation with a higher compression ratio and fewer quality losses in the compressed image, when compared with state-of-the-art approximate DTT hardware designs.",DTT; Approximate computing; Image compression; Low power; ASIC

This study aims to conduct a bibliometric analysis of business model research, identifying the state of the art, trends, and other indicators by analyzing articles published on the Web of Science (WoS) platform from 2017 to 2022. The present study examines the simultaneous occurrence of publications by year, keyword trends, bibliographic coupling, analysis of co-authorship, cities, and institutions, and finds that the literature on business models rapidly expanded between 2017 and 2020. A total of 14,881 articles were obtained as samples. The present study employs VOSviewer software to analyze the data. A considerable amount of literature has been produced on BMs, but researchers have stopped developing further literature which is thought-provoking.

1973,Situational Strength as a Lens to Understand the Strain Implications of Extra-Normative Work,"Charles Calderwood,Rustin D Meyer,Molly E Minnen,Charles Calderwood,Rustin D Meyer,Molly E Minnen","Employees must often perform work outside of the time and/or space requirements that typically define their job role (e.g., working after-hours, teleworking), especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. We introduce the concept of extra-normative work to capture this idea and draw on situational strength theory to test the seemingly paradoxical hypotheses that (1) the effects of extra-normative work are more harmful to employee strain when this work represents a stronger situation (i.e., one that unambiguously prescribes expected behavior), relative to when this work represents a weaker situation (i.e., one that allows for greater personal choice and behavioral latitude), but that (2) this strain is diminished when situational strength is achieved by maximizing the clarity and consistency of extra-normative work, while this strain is enhanced when situational strength is achieved by imposing greater constraints and consequences surrounding extra-normative work. These predictions were supported in an experimental vignette study, a survey focused on after-hours work experiences, and an investigation of telework in response to COVID-19. We discuss the theoretical implications of viewing extra-normative work through the lens of situational strength, while also outlining how our findings inform best practices surrounding how to communicate about and frame extra-normative work to employees.",COVID-19; Employee strain; Extra-normative work; Situational strength; Telework.
1974,"Liquid State Machine With Dendritically Enhanced Readout for Low-Power, Neuromorphic VLSI Implementations","Roy, Subhrajit; Banerjee, Amitava; Basu, Arindam","In this paper, we describe a new neuro-inspired, hardware-friendly readout stage for the liquid state machine (LSM), a popular model for reservoir computing. Compared to the parallel perceptron architecture trained by the p-delta algorithm, which is the state of the art in terms of performance of readout stages, our readout architecture and learning algorithm can attain better performance with significantly less synaptic resources making it attractive for VLSI implementation. Inspired by the nonlinear properties of dendrites in biological neurons, our readout stage incorporates neurons having multiple dendrites with a lumped nonlinearity (two compartment model). The number of synaptic connections on each branch is significantly lower than the total number of connections from the liquid neurons and the learning algorithm tries to find the best ` combination' of input connections on each branch to reduce the error. Hence, the learning involves network rewiring (NRW) of the readout network similar to structural plasticity observed in its biological counterparts. We show that compared to a single perceptron using analog weights, this architecture for the readout can attain, even by using the same number of binary valued synapses, up to 3.3 times less error for a two-class spike train classification problem and 2.4 times less error for an input rate approximation task. Even with 60 times larger synapses, a group of 60 parallel perceptrons cannot attain the performance of the proposed dendritically enhanced readout. An additional advantage of this method for hardware implementations is that the ` choice' of connectivity can be easily implemented exploiting address event representation (AER) protocols commonly used in current neuromorphic systems where the connection matrix is stored in memory. Also, due to the use of binary synapses, our proposed method is more robust against statistical variations.",Binary synapse; liquid state machine; neuromorphic engineering; nonlinear dendrite; readout; supervised learning
1975,Orchid classification using homogeneous ensemble of small deep convolutional neural network,"Sarachai, Watcharin; Bootkrajang, Jakramate; Chaijaruwanich, Jeerayut; Somhom, Samerkae","Orchids are flowering plants in the large and diverse family Orchidaceae. Orchid flowers may share similar visual characteristics even they are from different species. Thus, classifying orchid species from images is a hugely challenging task. Motivated by the inadequacy of the current state-of-the-art general-purpose image classification methods in differentiating subtle differences between orchid flower images, we propose a hybrid model architecture to better classify the orchid species from images. The model architecture is composed of three parts: the global prediction network (GPN), the local prediction network (LPN), and the ensemble neural network (ENN). The GPN predicts the orchid species by global features of orchid flowers. The LPN looks into local features such as the organs of orchid plant via a spatial transformer network. Finally, the ENN fuses the intermediate predictions from the GPN and the LPN modules and produces the final prediction. All modules are implemented based on a robust convolutional neural network with transfer learning methodology from notable existing models. Due to the interplay between the modules, we also guidelined the training steps necessary for achieving higher predictive performance. The classification results based on an extensive in-house Orchids-52 dataset demonstrated the superiority of the proposed method compared to the state of the art.",Orchids flowers; Classification; Deep learning; Convolutional neural network (CNN)

We show that we can correct the mistakes made by a Convolutional Neural Network trained to predict an estimate of the 3D pose by using a feedback loop. The components of this feedback loop are also Deep Networks, optimized using training data. This approach can be generalized to a hand interacting with an object. Therefore, we jointly estimate the 3D pose of the hand and the 3D pose of the object. Our approach performs en-par with state-of-the-art methods for 3D hand pose estimation, and outperforms state-of-the-art methods for joint hand-object pose estimation when using depth images only. Also, our approach is efficient as our implementation runs in real-time on a single GPU.",Three-dimensional displays; Pose estimation; Solid modeling; Optimization; Feedback loop; Training data; Data models; 3D hand pose estimation; 3D object pose estimation; feedback loop; hand-object manipulation
1977,Large-Scale Image Clustering Based on Camera Fingerprints,"Lin, Xufeng; Li, Chang-Tsun","Practical applications of digital forensics are often faced with the challenge of grouping large-scale suspicious images into a vast number of clusters, each containing images taken by the same camera. This task can be approached by resorting to the use of sensor pattern noise (SPN), which serves as the fingerprint of the camera. The challenges of large-scale image clustering come from the sheer volume of the image set and the high dimensionality of each image. The difficulties can be further aggravated when the number of classes (i.e., the number of cameras) is much higher than the average size of class (i.e., the number of images acquired by each camera). We refer to this as the NC >> SC problem, which is not uncommon in many practical scenarios. In this paper, we propose a novel clustering framework that is capable of addressing the NC >> SC problem without a training process. The proposed clustering framework was evaluated on the Dresden image database and compared with the state-of-the-art SPN-based image clustering algorithms. Experimental results show that the proposed clustering framework is much faster than the state-of-the-art algorithms while maintaining a high level of clustering quality.",Image clustering; digital forensics; sensor pattern noise; large-scale data mining; divide-and-conquer; graph partitioning

Here, we perform a comparative analysis of SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells in healthy individuals following vaccination with inactivated SARS-CoV-2 or mRNA vaccines. Relative to spike mRNA vaccination, inactivated vaccines elicit a lower magnitude of spike-specific T cells, but the combination of membrane, nucleoprotein, and spike-specific T cell response is quantitatively comparable with the sole spike T cell response induced by mRNA vaccine, and they efficiently tolerate the mutations characterizing the Omicron lineage. However, this multi-protein-specific T cell response is not mediated by a coordinated CD4 and CD8 T cell expansion but by selective priming of CD4 T cells. These findings can help in understanding the role of CD4 and CD8 T cells in the efficacy of the different vaccines to control severe COVID-19 after Omicron infection.",COVID-19; T cell response; adaptive immune response; inactivated vaccine.
1979,Dynamic Image Quantization Using Leaky Integrate-and-Fire Neurons,"Doutsi, Effrosyni; Fillatre, Lionel; Antonini, Marc; Tsakalides, Panagiotis","This paper introduces a novel coding/decoding mechanism that mimics one of the most important properties of the human visual system: its ability to enhance the visual perception quality in time. In other words, the brain takes advantage of time to process and clarify the details of the visual scene. This characteristic is yet to be considered by the state-of-the-art quantization mechanisms that process the visual information regardless the duration of time it appears in the visual scene. We propose a compression architecture built of neuroscience models; it first uses the leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) model to transform the visual stimulus into a spike train and then it combines two different kinds of spike interpretation mechanisms (SIM), the time-SIM and the rate-SIM for the encoding of the spike train. The time-SIM allows a high quality interpretation of the neural code and the rate-SIM allows a simple decoding mechanism by counting the spikes. For that reason, the proposed mechanisms is called Dual-SIM quantizer (Dual-SIMQ). We show that (i) the time-dependency of Dual-SIMQ automatically controls the reconstruction accuracy of the visual stimulus, (ii) the numerical comparison of Dual-SIMQ to the state-of-the-art shows that the performance of the proposed algorithm is similar to the uniform quantization schema while it approximates the optimal behavior of the non-uniform quantization schema and (iii) from the perceptual point of view the reconstruction quality using the Dual-SIMQ is higher than the state-of-the-art.",Quantization (signal); Image reconstruction; Neurons; Visualization; Image coding; Transforms; Mathematical model; Uniform quantization; non-uniform quantization; leaky integrate-and-fire model; spikes; rate coding; time coding

In this study, we investigated the role of circBGN in regulating proliferation and invasion of GC cells and elucidated the mechanism. The expression of circBGN was assessed by quantitative reverse-transcription PCR and in situ hybridization. In addition, loss- and gain-of-function investigations in vitro and in vivo were performed to determine the biological functions of circBGN. Luciferase reporter assays and rescue experiments were applied to investigate the interaction between circBGN and miR-149-5p as well as the relationship between miR-149-5p and IL6. Our results showed that circBGN expression was significantly elevated in GC tissues and cells. Knockdown of circBGN dramatically suppressed GC cell proliferation and invasion in vitro. Xenograft experiments revealed that knockdown of circBGN delayed tumor growth in vivo. Furthermore, circBGN can directly bind to miR-149-5p, thereby preventing miR-149-5p from binding to its target mRNA [IL6 mRNA], thus activating IL6/STAT3 signaling pathway. Rescue assays indicated that circBGN regulates GC cell proliferation and invasion by upregulating miR-149-5p/IL6 axis output. Taken together, our investigation indicates that circBGN supports GC progression by activating IL6/STAT3 signaling pathway, thus pointing to a new possible therapeutic target in GC.",IL6/STAT3; circBGN; circular RNA; gastric cancer; miR-149-5p.

Necroptosis is the significant cellular signal pathway in tumors which may overcome tumor cells' apoptosis resistance. To investigate the relationship between CC and necroptosis, we established a prognostic model based on necroptosis-related genes for predicting the overall survival (OS) of CC patients. The gene expression data and clinical information of cervical squamous cell carcinoma and endocervical adenocarcinoma (CESC) patients were obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). We identified 43 differentially expressed necroptosis-related genes (NRGs) in CESC by examining differential gene expression between CESC tumors and normal tissues, and 159 NRGs from the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) database. Gene ontology (GO) and KEGG enrichment analysis illustrated that the genes identified were mainly related to cell necrosis, extrinsic apoptosis, Influenza A, I - kappaB kinase/NF - kappaB, NOD - like receptor, and other signaling pathways. Subsequently, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression and univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses were used to screen for NRGs that were correlated with patient prognosis. A prognostic signature that includes CAMK2A, CYBB, IL1A, IL1B, SLC25A5, and TICAM2 was established. Based on the prognostic model, patients were stratified into either the high-risk or low-risk subgroups with distinct survival. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was used to identify the predictive accuracy of the model. In relation to different clinical variables, stratification analyses were performed to demonstrate the associations between the expression levels of the six identified NRGs and the clinical variables in CESC. Immunohistochemical (IHC) validation experiments explored abnormal expressions of these six NRGs in CESC. We also explored the relationship between risk score of this necroptosis signature and expression levels of some driver genes in TCGA CESC database and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) datasets. Significant relationships between the six prognostic NRGs and immune-cell infiltration, chemokines, tumor mutation burden (TMB), microsatellite instability (MSI), and immune checkpoints in CESC were discovered. In conclusion, we successfully constructed and validated a novel NRG signature for predicting the prognosis of CC patients and might also play a crucial role in the progression and immune microenvironment in CC.",Cervical carcinoma; Necroptosis-related genes; Prognostic signature; Tumor microenvironment infiltration.
1985,Trusted Interconnections Between a Centralized Controller and Commercial Building HVAC Systems for Reliable Demand Response,"Jones, C. Birk; Carter, Cedric, Jr.","Dynamic smart grid operations require that utilities that incorporate intermittent renewable energy resources provide creative and inclusive solutions to reduce and shift electrical demand. Commercial building HVAC systems have been used as a dispatchable load, but are limited by the lack of interoperability. Increased operability can be achieved using a secure and reliable interconnection device, which can provide direct bidirectional communications between the utility and the building automation system (BAS) controllers. This paper developed and tested a building automation intrusion detection system (BAIDS) that can provide a cyber-secure connection between public and private BAS networks. The BAIDS was used in a hardware-in-the-loop experiment that connected an actual photovoltaic array with a BAS control test bed and a building zone model. The BAIDS device allowed for critical control signals to pass from the public network directly to a fan controller in a BAS private network. At the same time, the BAIDS device provided intrusion detection monitoring to identify malicious activity. The network traffic was evaluated using an adaptive resonance theory (ART) artificial neural network. The ART algorithm was able to learn normal traffic activity on the private and public networks. The algorithm was then used to detect unauthorized attempts to access the interconnection device and a malicious cyber-physical attack on the BAS.",Demand response; cyber security; intrusion detection; power demand; data security; centralized control; intelligent control

Core biopsy of the mass was promptly scheduled, and the histological report came back positive for Nottingham Grade II NST invasive carcinoma of the breast. The patient underwent breast-conserving surgery and concomitant axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) for removal of the malignant mass. Care was taken to preserve the axillary vein and the long thoracic nerve. Closure of the axillary incision required mobilization of skin flaps to ensure optimal cosmetic results. Despite the ectopic breast tissue being a largely benign and infrequent occurrence, the breast surgeon must remain vigilant for the possibility of CABT development. At any rate, further epidemiological studies incorporating as many patients as possible are required in order to formulate recommendations on the management and prognosis of CABT. Until such guidelines exist, excision of the carcinoma, along with ALND performance, is a reasonable and justified approach to the surgical treatment of CABT.",accessory breast tissue; breast cancer; ectopic malignancy.
1987,A high-speed RSD-based flexible ECC processor for arbitrary curves over general prime field,"Shah, Yasir Ali; Javeed, Khalid; Azmat, Shoaib; Wang, Xiaojun","This workpresents a novel high-speed redundant-signed-digit (RSD)-based elliptic curve cryptographic (ECC) processor for arbitrary curves over a general prime field. The proposed ECC processor works for any value of the prime number and curve parameters. It is based on a new high speed Montgomery multiplier architecture which uses different parallel computation techniques at both circuit level and architectural level. At the circuit level, RSD and carry save techniques are adopted while pre-computation logic is incorporated at the architectural level. As a result of these optimization strategies, the proposed Montgomery multiplier offers a significant reduction in computation time over the state-of-the-art. At the system level, to further enhance the overall performance of the proposed ECC processor, Montgomery ladder algorithm with (X,Y)-only common Z coordinate (co-Z) arithmetic is adopted. The proposed ECC processor is synthesized and implemented on different Xilinx Virtex (V) FPGA families for field sizes of 256 to 521 bits. On V-6 platform, it computes a single 256 to 521 bits scalar point multiplication operation in 0.65 to 2.6ms which is up to 9 times speed-up over the state-of-the-art.",elliptic curve cryptography; field programmable gate array (FPGA); high-speed; redundant-signed-digit (RSD); scalar point multiplication
1988,A Cascade Rotated Anchor-Aided Detector for Ship Detection in Remote Sensing Images,"Yu, Ying; Yang, Xi; Li, Jie; Gao, Xinbo","Automatic ship detection in high-resolution remote sensing images has attracted increasing research interest due to its numerous practical applications. However, there still exist challenges when directly applying state-of-the-art object detection methods to real ship detection, which greatly limits the detection accuracy. In this article, we propose a novel cascade rotated anchor-aided detection network to achieve high-precision performance for detecting arbitrary-oriented ships. First, we develop a data preprocessing embedded cascade structure to reduce large amounts of false positives generated on blank areas in large-size remote sensing images. Second, to achieve accurate arbitrary-oriented ship detection, we design a rotated anchor-aided detection module. This detection module adopts a coarse-to-fine architecture with a cascade refinement module (CRM) to refine the rotated boxes progressively. Meanwhile, it utilizes an anchor-aided strategy similar to anchor-free, thus breaking through the bottlenecks of anchor-based methods and leading to a more flexible detection manner. Besides, a rotated align convolution layer is introduced in CRM to extract features from rotated regions accurately. Experimental results on the challenging DOTA and HRSC2016 data sets show that the proposed method achieves 84.12% and 90.79% AP, respectively, outperforming other state-of-the-art methods.",Cascade rotated anchor-aided detector; remote sensing images; ship detection
1989,Redefining Cardiovascular Health to Include Sleep: Prospective Associations With Cardiovascular Disease in the MESA Sleep Study,"Nour Makarem,Cecilia Castro-Diehl,Marie-Pierre St-Onge,Susan Redline,Steven Shea,Donald Lloyd-Jones,Hongyan Ning,Brooke Aggarwal,Nour Makarem,Cecilia Castro-Diehl,Marie-Pierre St-Onge,Susan Redline,Steven Shea,Donald Lloyd-Jones,Hongyan Ning,Brooke Aggarwal","Background Although sufficient and healthy sleep is inversely associated with cardiovascular disease (CVD) and its risk factors, the American Heart Association's Life's Simple 7 (LS7), as a measure of cardiovascular health (CVH), did not include sleep. We evaluated an expanded measure of CVH that includes sleep as an eighth metric in relation to CVD risk. Methods and Results The analytic sample consisted of MESA (Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis) Sleep Study participants who had complete data on sleep characteristics from overnight polysomnography, 7-day wrist actigraphy, validated questionnaires, and the outcome. We computed the LS7 score and 4 iterations of a new CVH score: score 1 included sleep duration, score 2 included sleep characteristics linked to CVD in the literature (sleep duration, insomnia, daytime sleepiness, and obstructive sleep apnea), scores 3 and 4 included sleep characteristics associated with CVD in MESA (score 3: sleep duration and efficiency, daytime sleepiness, and obstructive sleep apnea; score 4: score 3+sleep regularity). Multivariable-adjusted logistic and Cox proportional hazards models evaluated associations of the LS7 and CVH scores 1 to 4 with CVD prevalence and incidence. Among 1920 participants (mean age: 69±9 years; 54% female), there were 95 prevalent CVD events and 93 incident cases (mean follow-up, 4.4 years). Those in the highest versus lowest tertile of the LS7 score and CVH scores 1 to 4 had up to 80% lower odds of prevalent CVD. The LS7 score was not significantly associated with CVD incidence (hazard ratio, 0.62 [95% CI, 0.37-1.04]). Those in the highest versus lowest tertile of CVH score 1, which included sleep duration, and CVH score 4, which included multidimensional sleep health, had 43% and 47% lower incident CVD risk (hazard ratio, 0.57 [95% CI, 0.33-0.97]; and hazard ratio, 0.53 [95% CI, 0.32-0.89]), respectively. Conclusions CVH scores that include sleep health predicted CVD risk in older US adults. The incorporation of sleep as a CVH metric, akin to other health behaviors, may enhance CVD primordial and primary prevention efforts. Findings warrant confirmation in larger cohorts over longer follow-up.",Life's Essential 8; Life's Simple 7; cardiovascular diseases; cardiovascular health; health behaviors; primordial prevention; sleep.

1991,Low-Power CMOS Smart Temperature Sensor With a Batch-Calibrated Inaccuracy of +/- 0.25 degrees C (+/- 3 sigma) from -70 degrees C to 130 degrees C,"Aita, Andre L.; Pertijs, Michiel A. P.; Makinwa, Kofi A. A.; Huijsing, Johan H.; Meijer, Gerard C. M.","In this paper, a low-power CMOS smart temperature sensor is presented. The temperature information extracted using substrate PNP transistors is digitized with a resolution of 0.03 degrees C using a precision switched-capacitor (SC) incremental Delta Sigma A/D converter. After batch calibration, an inaccuracy of +/- 0.25 degrees C (+/- 3 sigma) from -70 degrees C to 130 degrees C is obtained. This represents a two-fold improvement compared to the state-of-the-art. After individual calibration at room temperature, an inaccuracy better than +/- 0.1 degrees C over the military temperature range is obtained, which is in-line with the state-of-the-art. This performance is achieved at a power consumption of 65 mu W during a measurement time of 100 ms, by optimizing the power/inaccuracy tradeoffs, and by employing a clock frequency proportional to absolute temperature. The latter ensures accurate settling of the SC input stage at low temperatures, and reduces the effects of leakage currents at high temperatures.",Delta Sigma A/D conversion; batch calibration; smart temperature sensors; substrate PNP transistors
1992,The political system through a partisan lens: Within-person changes in support for political parties precede political system attitudes,"Nicole Satherley,Danny Osborne,Chris G Sibley,Nicole Satherley,Danny Osborne,Chris G Sibley","Although political party support and attitudes towards the political system are closely related, the temporal ordering of these associations is unclear. Indeed, prior research identifies both partisan-led change in system attitudes and system attitude-led change in party support. Using a ten-year (2010-2020) national probability sample of New Zealand adults (N = 66,359), we test these associations by modelling the within-person cross-lagged effects between conservative and liberal party support, and political system justification. During conservative-led governments, increases in conservative party support predicted increases in political system justification more strongly than vice versa. The 2017 shift to a liberal-led government was met with an immediate reversal of the effects of party support on system justification, but the effect of system justification on party support took a full year to reverse. These results demonstrate people's perceptions of the fairness of the political system depend on their support for the party in power.",RI-CLPM; elections; longitudinal analysis; partisanship; party support; system justification.

Thus, up-flow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) could be a promising energy recovery process to treat thermal hydrolyzed sludge dewatering liquor with significantly augmented the organic loading rate (OLR). In this study, its performance was investigated using a lab-scale UASB to treat sludge dewatering liquor after 165 °C, 30 min thermal hydrolysis pretreatment. The results show that 85.57% of the organic in thermal hydrolyzed sludge dewatering liquor could be converted to methane. The UASB adapts to high OLR stably, and the COD removal efficiency was 71.98 ± 1.95% at OLR of 18.35 ± 0.78 kgCOD·(m3·d)-1, and the gap between the maximum potential and experimental methane production yields could be observed during different OLRs. It could be explained as the methanogenesis rate decreased due to the shift of dominant pathway from acetoclastic methanogenesis to syntrophic acetate oxidation following hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis. Methanospirillum became the dominant methanogen with the increase of OLR. In addition, the methane production yield and rate would be hindered till the ammonia nitrogen concentration exceeds 4 g·L-1. Direct interspecies electron transfer could be promising methods to improve UASB performance treating thermal hydrolyzed dewatering liquor.",Ammonia inhibition; High solid sludge; Thermal hydrolysis pretreatment; Up-flow anaerobic sludge blanket.

In this study, a facile and efficient method was described for the synthesis of 3-acyltetramic acids. The synthesis was accomplished mainly via (1) mild intramolecular cyclization and (2) the formation of β-ketoamides between nucleophiles and acyl Meldrum's acids. 3-Acyltetramic acid exhibited phytotoxicity against Echinochloa crusgalli and Portulaca oleracea. At a dosage of 750 g ha-1, 6k and 6a showed high herbicidal activity against E. crusgalli, Digitaria sanguinalis and P. oleracea, Amaranthus retroflexus, respectively. 6k inhibited the synthesis of endogenous abscisic acid, thus seedling germination and plant growth. The incorporation of various acyl Meldrum's acids and amino acid esters was applicable to the parallel synthesis of 3-acyltetramic acids. The mode of action and herbicidal activity indicate that 3-tetramic acid had good herbicidal performance and was a promising herbicide candidate. This study will provide a reference for novel herbicide development.",3-acyltetramic acid; abscisic acid; biological assay; herbicidal mechanism; total synthesis.
1995,Interviewing in virtual environments: Towards understanding the impact of rapport-building behaviours and retrieval context on eyewitness memory,"Coral Dando,Donna A Taylor,Alessandra Caso,Zacharia Nahouli,Charlotte Adam,Coral Dando,Donna A Taylor,Alessandra Caso,Zacharia Nahouli,Charlotte Adam","Given the complexities of episodic memory and necessarily social nature of in-person face-to-face interviews, theoretical and evidence-based techniques for collecting episodic information from witnesses, victims, and survivors champion rapport-building. Rapport is believed to reduce some of the social demands of recalling an experienced event in an interview context, potentially increasing cognitive capacity for remembering. Cognitive and social benefits have also emerged in remote interview contexts with reduced anxiety and social pressure contributing to improved performance. Here, we investigated episodic memory in mock-eyewitness interviews conducted in virtual environments (VE) and in-person face-to-face (FtF), where rapport-building behaviours were either present or absent. Main effects revealed when rapport was present and where interviews were conducted in a VE participants recalled more correct event information, made fewer errors and were more accurate. Moreover, participants in the VE plus rapport-building present condition outperformed participants in all other conditions. Feedback indicated both rapport and environment were important for reducing the social demands of a recall interview, towards supporting effortful remembering. Our results add to the emerging literature on the utility of virtual environments as interview spaces and lend further support to the importance of prosocial behaviours in applied contexts.",Cognitive Resources; Episodic memory; Eyewitnesses; Rapport; Virtual Environment.
1996,Human action recognition by means of subtensor projections and dense trajectories,"Maria Carmona, Josep; Climent, Joan","In last years, most human action recognition works have used dense trajectories features, to achieve state-of-the-art results. Histograms of Oriented Gradients (HOG), Histogram of Optical Flow (HOF) and Motion Boundary Histograms (MBH) features are extracted from regions and being tracked across the frames. The goal of this paper is to improve the performance obtained by means of Improved Dense Trajectories (IDTs), adding new features based on temporal templates. We construct these templates considering a video sequence as a third-order tensor and computing three different projections. We use several functions for projecting the fibers from the video sequences, and combined them by means of sum pooling. As a first contribution of our work, we present in detail the method based on tensor projections. First, we have assessed the results obtained using only template based action recognition. Next, in order to achieve state-of-art recognition rates, we have fused our features with those of IDTs. This is the second contribution of the article. Experiments on four different public datasets have shown that this technique improves IDTs performance and that the results outperform the ones obtained by most of the state-of-the-art techniques for action recognition.

These communication infrastructures are usually built around custom-designed FPGA systems. However, the overall bandwidth requirements and the integration density of very large neuromorphic systems necessitate a significantly more targeted approach, i.e. the development of dedicated integrated circuits. We present a VLSI realization of a neuromorphic communication system-on-chip (SoC) with a cumulative throughput of 32 GBit/s in 0.18 mu m CMOS, employing state-of-the-art circuit blocks. Several of these circuits exhibit improved performance compared to current literature, e.g. a priority queue with a speed of 31 Mkeys/s at 1.3 mW, or a 1 GHz PLL at 5 mW. The SoC contains additional neuromorphic functionality, such as configurable event delays and event ordering. The complete configuration of the neuromorphic system is also handled by the spike communication channels, in contrast to the separate channels required in the majority of current systems. At 865 Mevent/s, the SoC delivers at least a factor of eight more bandwidth than other current neuromorphic communication infrastructures. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

In tissues prepared by immersion in a chemical fixative, followed by conventional processing for paraffin embedding, red blood cell autofluorescence across several imaging channels can be a nuisance. Although many protocols have been proposed to suppress red blood cell autofluorescence prior to microscopy imaging, in many instances they may not prove totally effective. Moreover, in environments such as core facilities where control over tissue processing and staining may not be feasible, methods to address autofluorescence via post-image acquisition processing may be of some advantage. To this end, we have developed an image analysis algorithm using a commercially based software platform to remove contaminating red blood cell autofluorescence during quantitative evaluation of the fluorescence signal from an immunostaining protocol. The method is based upon the low autofluorescence signal of red blood cells exhibited in the blue channel (used to detect DAPI nuclear signal of all cells), which can be subtracted from the total channel signal by increasing the threshold for DAPI signal in the nuclear detection settings during nuclear segmentation. With the contributing signal from the red blood cells eliminated, the specific immunostained signal for the antigen of interest could be determined. We believe that this simple algorithm performed on post-acquisition microscopy images will be of use for quantitative fluorescence analyses whenever red blood cell autofluorescence is present, especially in amounts where creating regions of interest for evaluation is not possible.",Autofluorescence; Confocal microscopy; Light microscopy; Quantitative image analysis; Red blood cells.

Investigations of relationships between nest predation rate and habitat usually pool different predator species. However, such relationships likely depend on the specific predator involved, partly because habitat requirements vary among predator species. Pooling may therefore impair our ability to identify conservation-relevant relationships between nest predation rate and habitat. We investigated predator-specific nest predation rates in the forest-dependent, ground-nesting wood warbler Phylloscopus sibilatrix in relation to forest area and forest edge complexity at two spatial scales and to the composition of the adjacent habitat matrix. We used camera traps at 559 nests to identify nest predators in five study regions across Europe. When analyzing predation data pooled across predator species, nest predation rate was positively related to forest area at the local scale (1000 m around nest), and higher where proportion of grassland in the adjacent habitat matrix was high but arable land low. Analyses by each predator species revealed variable relationships between nest predation rates and habitat. At the local scale, nest predation by most predators was higher where forest area was large. At the landscape scale (10,000 m around nest), nest predation by buzzards Buteo buteo was high where forest area was small. Predation by pine martens Martes martes was high where edge complexity at the landscape scale was high. Predation by badgers Meles meles was high where the matrix had much grassland but little arable land. Our results suggest that relationships between nest predation rates and habitat can depend on the predator species involved and may differ from analyses disregarding predator identity. Predator-specific nest predation rates, and their relationships to habitat at different spatial scales, should be considered when assessing the impact of habitat change on avian nesting success.",habitat fragmentation; nest survival; spatial scale; species specific; woodland.
2001,MS-Net: Multi-Site Network for Improving Prostate Segmentation With Heterogeneous MRI Data,"Liu, Quande; Dou, Qi; Yu, Lequan; Heng, Pheng Ann","Automated prostate segmentation in MRI is highly demanded for computer-assisted diagnosis. Recently, a variety of deep learning methods have achieved remarkable progress in this task, usually relying on large amounts of training data. Due to the nature of scarcity for medical images, it is important to effectively aggregate data from multiple sites for robust model training, to alleviate the insufficiency of single-site samples. However, the prostate MRIs from different sites present heterogeneity due to the differences in scanners and imaging protocols, raising challenges for effective ways of aggregating multi-site data for network training. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-site network (MS-Net) for improving prostate segmentation by learning robust representations, leveraging multiple sources of data. To compensate for the inter-site heterogeneity of different MRI datasets, we develop Domain-Specific Batch Normalization layers in the network backbone, enabling the network to estimate statistics and perform feature normalization for each site separately. Considering the difficulty of capturing the shared knowledge from multiple datasets, a novel learning paradigm, i.e., Multi-site-guided Knowledge Transfer, is proposed to enhance the kernels to extract more generic representations from multi-site data. Extensive experiments on three heterogeneous prostate MRI datasets demonstrate that our MS-Net improves the performance across all datasets consistently, and outperforms state-of-the-art methods for multi-site learning.",Magnetic resonance imaging; Image segmentation; Training; Robustness; Data models; Biomedical imaging; Task analysis; Prostatesegmentation; ulti-site learning; feature normalization; knowledge transfer

Integration of these lacO sequences into a genomic region of interest allows to monitor the functional consequences of HAT/HDAC targeting on chromatin (de)compaction, histone modification, and interaction with other proteins by quantitative light microscopy, as described here. As DNA-binding of LacI can be tightly controlled by the addition of galactose-derivatives, this method also allows to monitor the effects of locus-specific recruitment in a time-resolved manner.",Acetylation; Chromatin; Histone acetyltransferases; Histone modification; Immunofluorescence; LacI/lacO.

Unfortunately, most machine learning architectures are not designed to directly handle sparse data, like that generated from event cameras. Many state-of-the-art algorithms for event cameras rely on interpolated event representations-obscuring crucial timing information, increasing the data volume, and limiting overall network performance.

This bio-inspired design is memory efficient, computationally fast, avoids time-blocking (i.e., fixed and predefined frame rates), and contains ""local memory "" from past data. The design is evaluated on a wide range of challenging tasks (e.g., event denoising, image reconstruction, classification, and human pose estimation) and is shown to dramatically improve state-of-the-art performance.

This position is closely related to the belief that there is a radical opposition between hunter-gatherers and agropastoralist - wild vs. domestic - where hunting is not envisaged to have neither a complementary economic purpose nor a significant social and symbolic role during the settlement and expansion of the ""Neolithic package"". In order to assess the validity of Levantine hunting scenes as a chrono-cultural marker of Epipalaeolithic-Mesolithic societies, this paper explores the role of hunting in Neolithic societies of the Iberian Mediterranean Basin (6th-3rd millennium cal BC). To do this, economic data, from archae-ozoological and isotopic studies permitting the evaluation of wild and domestic animals consumption patterns, along with other social, identity-related and symbolic elements, such as the funerary record, personal ornaments and Levantine iconography itself, will be taking into account.

This property is able to facilitate the kernel estimation in the conventional maximum a posterior (MAP) framework. Based on this prior, we develop an efficient optimization method to solve the proposed model. The proposed method does not require any complex filtering strategies to select salient edges which are critical to the state-of-the-art deblurring algorithms.

Particularly, polymer-based PDRC materials, with advantages of easy-processing, low cost, and outstanding cooling performance, have attracted intense attention. However, just like other polymer devices (for example polymer solar cells) working under sunlight, the issue of durability related to mechanical and UV properties needs to be addressed for large-scale practical applications. Here, a spider-silk-inspired design of nanocomposite polymers with potassium titanate (K2 Ti6 O13 ) nanofiber dopants is proposed for enhancing the durability without compromising their cooling performance. The formed tough interface of nanofiber/polymer effectively disperses stress, enhancing the mechanical properties of the polymer matrix; while the K2 Ti6 O13 can absorb high-energy UV photons and transform them into less harmful heat, thereby improving the UV stabilities. Taking poly(ethylene oxide) radiative cooler as an example for demonstration, its Young's modulus and UV resistance increase by 7 and 12 times, respectively. Consequently, the solar reflectance of nanocomposite poly(ethylene oxide) is maintained as constant in a continuous aging test for 720 h under outdoor sunlight. The work provides a general strategy to simultaneously enhance both the mechanical stability and the UV durability of polymer-based PDRC materials toward large-scale applications.",durability; passive daytime radiative cooling; poly(ethylene oxide); potassium titanate; radiative cooling.

Also, the gene expression results using the PCR method displayed that Fe2 O3 formulated nanoparticles induced BAX apoptosis by increasing the anti-apoptotic gene expression and decreasing the expression of pro-apoptotic gene BCL2, so the cell progresses to planned cell death. In addition, the results showed that the BAX/BCL2 ratio decreased significantly after treatment of MCF-7 cells with free Fe2 O3 nanoparticles, and the BAX/BCL2 ratio for Fe2 O3 formulated nanoparticles increased significantly. Also, to evaluate cell migration, the scratch test was performed, which showed a decrease in motility of MCF-7 cancer cells treated with Fe2 O3 nanoparticles formulated with chitosan/agarose at concentrations of 10, 50, 100, and 200 μg/ml.",agarose; biopolymer; breast cancer; chitosan; gene expression; magnetic nanoparticles.
2011,Learning Saliency From Single Noisy Labelling: A Robust Model Fitting Perspective,"Zhang, Jing; Dai, Yuchao; Zhang, Tong; Harandi, Mehrtash; Barnes, Nick; Hartley, Richard","The advances made in predicting visual saliency using deep neural networks come at the expense of collecting large-scale annotated data. However, pixel-wise annotation is labor-intensive and overwhelming. In this paper, we propose to learn saliency prediction from a single noisy labelling, which is easy to obtain (e.g., from imperfect human annotation or from unsupervised saliency prediction methods). With this goal, we address a natural question: Can we learn saliency prediction while identifying clean labels in a unified framework? To answer this question, we call on the theory of robust model fitting and formulate deep saliency prediction from a single noisy labelling as robust network learning and exploit model consistency across iterations to identify inliers and outliers (i.e., noisy labels). Extensive experiments on different benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of our proposed framework, which can learn comparable saliency prediction with state-of-the-art fully supervised saliency methods. Furthermore, we show that simply by treating ground truth annotations as noisy labelling, our framework achieves tangible improvements over state-of-the-art methods.",Noise measurement; Labeling; Predictive models; Annotations; Training; Task analysis; Saliency detection; Salinecy prediction; single noisy labelling; robust model fitting
2012,No-Reference JPEG Image Quality Assessment Based on Blockiness and Luminance Change,"Zhan, Yibing; Zhang, Rong","When scoring the quality of JPEG images, the two main considerations for viewers are blocking artifacts and improper luminance changes, such as blur. In this letter, we first propose two measures to estimate the blockiness and the luminance change within individual blocks. Then, a no-reference image quality assessment (NR-IQA) method for JPEG images is proposed. Our method obtains the quality score by considering the blocking artifacts and the luminance changes from all nonoverlapping 8 x 8 blocks in one JPEG image. The proposed method has been tested on five public IQA databases and compared with five state-of-the-art NR-IQA methods for JPEG images. The experimental results show that our method is more consistent with subjective evaluations than the state-of-the-art NR-IQA methods.

Here, we report that endocytosis of virus or foreign DNA initiates a priming signal for the DNA sensor cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS)-mediated innate immune response. Mechanistically, viral infection or foreign DNA transfection triggers recruitment of the spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK) and cGAS to the endosomal vacuolar H+ pump (V-ATPase), where SYK is activated and then phosphorylates human cGASY214/215 (mouse cGasY200/201) to prime its activation. Upon binding to DNA, the primed cGAS initiates robust cGAMP production and mediator of IRF3 activation/stimulator of interferon genes-dependent innate immune response. Consistently, blocking the V-ATPase-SYK axis impairs DNA virus- and transfected DNA-induced cGAMP production and expression of antiviral genes. Our findings reveal that V-ATPase-SYK-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of cGAS following endocytosis of virus or other cargos serves as a priming signal for cGAS activation and innate immune response.",DNA sensor cGAS; antiviral innate immunity; phosphorylation modification; signal transduction.
2014,Modelling and solving a cost-oriented resource-constrained multi-model assembly line balancing problem,"Pereira, Jordi","A line balancing problem considers the assignment of operations to workstations in an assembly line. While assembly lines are usually associated to mass production of standardised goods, their advantages have led to their widespread use whenever a product-oriented production system is applicable and the benefits of the labour division and specialisation are significant, even when some of its characteristics may deviate from classical assembly lines. In this work, we study a line balancing problem found in the textile industry in which the line must be balanced for multiple types of goods taking into account resource requirements. In order to solve the problem, a hybrid method that combines classical methods for line balancing with an Estimation of Distribution Algorithm is proposed. Computational experiments show that the new procedure improves upon the state of the art when compared using a benchmark set derived from the literature, as well as when compared using data from the manufacturer that originated this research work.",assembly line balancing; combinatorial optimisation; lower bound; heuristics; estimation of distribution algorithm
2015,Fronthaul Load Balancing in Energy Harvesting Powered Cloud Radio Access Networks,"Qin, Cheng; Ni, Wei; Tian, Hui; Liu, Ren Ping","Enhanced with wireless power transfer capability, cloud radio access network (C-RAN) enables energy-restrained mobile devices to function uninterruptedly. Beamforming of C-RAN has potential to improve the efficiency of wireless power transfer, in addition to transmission data rates. In this paper, we design the beamforming jointly for data transmission and energy transfer, under finite fronthaul capacity of C-RAN. A non-convex problem is formulated to balance the fronthaul requirements of different remote radio heads (RRHs). Norm approximations and relaxations are carried out to convexify the problem to second order cone programming (SOCP). To improve the scalability of the design to large networks, we further decentralize the SOCP problem using the alternating direction multiplier method (ADMM). A series of reformulations and transformations are conducted, such that the resultant problem conforms to the state-of-the-art ADMM solver and can be efficiently solved in real time. Simulation results show that the distributed algorithm can remarkably reduce the time complexity without compromising the fronthaul load balancing of its centralized counterpart. The proposed algorithms can also reduce the fronthaul bandwidth requirements by 25% to 50%, compared with the prior art.",Cloud radio access network (C-RAN); energy harvesting; fronthaul; decentralization
2016,Investigating the allosteric response of the PICK1 PDZ domain to different ligands with all-atom simulations,"Amy O Stevens,I Can Kazan,Banu Ozkan,Yi He,Amy O Stevens,I Can Kazan,Banu Ozkan,Yi He","The PDZ family is comprised of small modular domains that play critical roles in the allosteric modulation of many cellular signaling processes by binding to the C-terminal tail of different proteins. As dominant modular proteins that interact with a diverse set of peptides, it is of particular interest to explore how different binding partners induce different allosteric effects on the same PDZ domain. Because the PICK1 PDZ domain can bind different types of ligands, it is an ideal test case to answer this question and explore the network of interactions that give rise to dynamic allostery. Here, we use all-atom molecular dynamics simulations to explore dynamic allostery in the PICK1 PDZ domain by modeling two PICK1 PDZ systems: PICK1 PDZ-DAT and PICK1 PDZ-GluR2. Our results suggest that ligand binding to the PICK1 PDZ domain induces dynamic allostery at the αA helix that is similar to what has been observed in other PDZ domains. We found that the PICK1 PDZ-ligand distance is directly correlated with both dynamic changes of the αA helix and the distance between the αA helix and βB strand. Furthermore, our work identifies a hydrophobic core between DAT/GluR2 and I35 as a key interaction in inducing such dynamic allostery. Finally, the unique interaction patterns between different binding partners and the PICK1 PDZ domain can induce unique dynamic changes to the PICK1 PDZ domain. We suspect that unique allosteric coupling patterns with different ligands may play a critical role in how PICK1 performs its biological functions in various signaling networks.",PDZ; all-atom simulation; allosteric effect; dynamic coupling index; dynamic flexibility index; ligand.
2017,Transcriptional Profiling of Pseudomonas aeruginosa Infections,"Janne G Thöming,Susanne Häussler,Janne G Thöming,Susanne Häussler","Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an opportunistic pathogen that causes life-devastating acute as well as chronic biofilm-associated infections with limited treatment options. Its success is largely due to its remarkable adaptability. P. aeruginosa uses different long- and short-term adaptive mechanisms to increase its fitness, both at the population level through genetic diversification and at the individual cell level by adapting gene expression. These adapted gene expression profiles can be fixed by the accumulation of patho-adaptive mutations. The latter are often found in transcriptional regulators and lead to rewiring of the regulatory network to promote survival at the infected host site. In this chapter, we review recent developments in transcriptional profiling and explain how these provide new insights into the establishment and maintenance of P. aeruginosa infections. We illustrate what can be learned from the application of advanced RNA-seq technology, such as ex vivo RNA-seq, host-pathogen crosstalk (dual RNA-seq), or recording of transcriptional heterogeneity within a bacterial population (single-cell RNA-seq). In addition, we discuss how large transcriptome datasets from a variety of clinical isolates can be used to gain an expanded understanding of bacterial adaptation during the infection process. Global genotype-phenotype correlation studies provide a unique opportunity to discover new evolutionary pathways of infection-related phenotypes and led to the discovery of different strategies of the pathogen P. aeruginosa to build a biofilm. Insights gained from large-scale, multi-layered functional -omics approaches will continue to contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of P. aeruginosa adaptation to the host habitat and promises to pave the way for novel strategies to combat recalcitrant infections.",Adaptation; Biofilm formation; Genotype–phenotype correlation; Pseudomonas aeruginosa; Transcriptional profiling.

2019,In silico structural inhibition of ACE-2 binding site of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2 omicron spike protein by lectin antiviral dyad system to treat COVID-19,"Anand Kumar Pandey,Shalja Verma,Anand Kumar Pandey,Shalja Verma","Spike glycoprotein of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) binds angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2) receptors via its receptor-binding domain (RBD) and mediates virus-to-host cell fusion. Recently emerged omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2 possesses around 30 mutations in spike protein where N501Y tremendously increases viral infectivity and transmission. Lectins interact with glycoproteins and mediate innate immunity displaying antiviral, antibacterial, and anticarcinogenic properties. In this study, we analyzed the potential of lectin, and lectin-antibody (spike-specific) complex to inhibit the ACE-2 binding site of wild and N501Y mutated spike protein by utilizing in silico molecular docking and simulation approach. Docking of lectin at reported ACE-2 binding spike-RBD residues displayed the ZDock scores of 1907 for wild and 1750 for N501Y mutated spike-RBD. Binding of lectin with antibody to form proposed dyad complex gave ZDock score of 1174 revealing stable binding. Docking of dyad complex with wild and N501Y mutated spike-RBD, at lectin and antibody individually, showed high efficiency binding hence, effective structural inhibition of spike-RBD. MD simulation of 100 ns of each complex proved high stability of complexes with RMSD values ranging from 0.2 to 1.5 nm. Consistent interactions of lead ACE-2 binding spike residues with lectin during simulation disclosed efficient structural inhibition by lectin against formation of spike RBD-ACE-2 complex. Hence, lectins along with their ability to induce innate immunity against spike glycoprotein can structurally inhibit the spike-RBD when given as lectin-antibody dyad system and thus can be developed into a dual effect treatment against COVID-19. Moreover, the high binding specificity of this system with spike-RBD can be exploited for development of diagnostic and drug-delivery systems.",SARS-CoV-2; SARS-CoV-2 omicron; lectin; molecular docking; molecular dynamic simulation; spike protein.

In this study, we investigated the association between gut microbiota altered by SeNPs supplementation and its metabolites under oxidative stress conditions through 16S rDNA gene sequencing analysis and untargeted metabolomics. The results showed that dietary supplementation with SeNPs attenuated diquat-induced acute toxicity in mice, as demonstrated by lower levels of inflammatory effector cells, and biochemical markers in serum such as aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). SeNPs also reversed the perturbed gut microbiota composition induced by diquat, decreased the Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio, and increased the abundance of beneficial bacteria such as Akkermansia, Muribaculaceae, Bacteroides and Parabacteroides. Untargeted fecal metabolomics showed that SeNPs can regulate the production of steroids and steroid derivatives, organonitrogen compounds, pyridines and derivatives and other metabolites. Microbiome-metabolome correlation analysis suggested that Parabacteroides was the key bacteria for the SeNPs intervention, which might upregulate the levels of metabolites such as trimethaphan, emedastine, berberine, desoxycortone, tetrahydrocortisone. This study demonstrated that dietary SeNPs supplementation can extensively modulate the gut microbiota and its metabolism, thereby alleviating diquat-induced acute toxicity.",Diquat; Gut microbiota; Metabolites; Selenium nanoparticles; Toxicity.

2022,Self-Supervised Learning for Few-Shot Medical Image Segmentation,"Ouyang, Cheng; Biffi, Carlo; Chen, Chen; Kart, Turkay; Qiu, Huaqi; Rueckert, Daniel","Fully-supervised deep learning segmentation models are inflexible when encountering new unseen semantic classes and their fine-tuning often requires significant amounts of annotated data. Few-shot semantic segmentation (FSS) aims to solve this inflexibility by learning to segment an arbitrary unseen semantically meaningful class by referring to only a few labeled examples, without involving fine-tuning. State-of-the-art FSS methods are typically designed for segmenting natural images and rely on abundant annotated data of training classes to learn image representations that generalize well to unseen testing classes. However, such a training mechanism is impractical in annotation-scarce medical imaging scenarios. To address this challenge, in this work, we propose a novel self-supervised FSS framework for medical images, named SSL-ALPNet, in order to bypass the requirement for annotations during training. The proposed method exploits superpixel-based pseudo-labels to provide supervision signals. In addition, we propose a simple yet effective adaptive local prototype pooling module which is plugged into the prototype networks to further boost segmentation accuracy. We demonstrate the general applicability of the proposed approach using three different tasks: organ segmentation of abdominal CT and MRI images respectively, and cardiac segmentation of MRI images. The proposed method yields higher Dice scores than conventional FSS methods which require manual annotations for training in our experiments.",Image segmentation; Biomedical imaging; Training; Prototypes; Task analysis; Semantics; Annotations; Self-supervised learning; few-shot segmentation; representation learning

After 24 h of shrimp wastewater treatment, alginate beads containing the blue-green algal Synechocystis strain lacking the phosphate regulator gene (mutant strain ΔSphU) at 150 mg L-1 reduced phosphate content from 17.5 mg L-1 to 5.0 mg L-1, representing 71.5% removal efficiency, with phosphate removal rate reaching 6.9 mg gDW-1 h-1 during photobioreactor operation. For short-term treatment, removal rates of nitrate, ammonium and nitrite were 42.7, 48.5 and 92.9%, respectively. Microalgal encapsulated beads also impacted the bacterial community composition dynamics in shrimp wastewater. Next-generation sequencing targeting the V3-V4 region of the 16S rDNA gene showed significant differences in bacterial community composition after 24 h of treatment. Proteobacteria are the most abundant phylum in shrimp wastewater. After 24 h of bioremediation, reductions of harmful bacteria in the Cellvibrionaceae and Pseudomonadaceae families were recorded at 5.85 and 3.18%, respectively.

It has been suggested that electroencephalogram (EEG) can be used to provide exquisite temporal resolution for understanding motor control processes in ASD. However, the variability of study design and EEG approaches can impact our interpretation. Here, we conducted a systematic review on recent 11 EEG studies that involve motor observation and/or execution tasks and evaluated how these findings help us understand motor difficulties in ASD. Three behavior paradigms with different EEG analytic methods were demonstrated. The main findings were quite mixed: children with ASD did not always show disrupted neuronal activity during motor observation. Additionally, they might have intact ability for movement execution but have more difficulties in neuronal modulation during movement preparation. We would like to promote discussions on how methodological selections of behavioral tasks and data analytic approaches impact our interpretation of motor deficits in ASD. Future EEG research addressing the inconsistency across methodological approaches is necessary to help us understand neurophysiological mechanism of motor abnormalities in ASD.",Autism Spectrum Disorder; Electroencephalography; Motor control; Motor network.
2025,Stopping power accuracy and achievable spatial resolution of helium ion imaging using a prototype particle CT detector system,"Lennart Volz,Charles-Antoine Collins-Fekete,Pierluigi Piersimoni,Robert P Johnson,Vladimir Bashkirov,Reinhard Schulte,Joao Seco,Lennart Volz,Charles-Antoine Collins-Fekete,Pierluigi Piersimoni,Robert P Johnson,Vladimir Bashkirov,Reinhard Schulte,Joao Seco","A precise relative stopping power map of the patient is crucial for accurate particle therapy. Charged particle imaging determines the stopping power either tomographically - particle computed tomography (pCT) - or by combining prior knowledge from particle radiography (pRad) and x-ray CT. Generally, multiple Coulomb scattering limits the spatial resolution. Compared to protons, heavier particles scatter less due to their lower charge/mass ratio. A theoretical framework to predict the most likely trajectory of particles in matter was developed for light ions up to carbon and was found to be the most accurate for helium comparing for fixed initial velocity. To further investigate the potential of helium in particle imaging, helium computed tomography (HeCT) and radiography (HeRad) were studied at the Heidelberg Ion-Beam Therapy Centre (HIT) using a prototype pCT detector system registering individual particles, originally developed by the U.S. pCT collaboration. Several phantoms were investigated: modules of the Catphan QA phantom for analysis of spatial resolution and achievable stopping power accuracy, a paediatric head phantom (CIRS) and a custommade phantom comprised of animal meat enclosed in a 2 % agarose mixture representing human tissue. The pCT images were reconstructed applying the CARP iterative reconstruction algorithm. The MTF10% was investigated using a sharp edge gradient technique. HeRad provides a spatial resolution above that of protons (MTF1010%=6.07 lp/cm for HeRad versus MTF10%=3.35 lp/cm for proton radiography). For HeCT, the spatial resolution was limited by the number of projections acquired (90 projections for a full scan). The RSP accuracy for all inserts of the Catphan CTP404 module was found to be 2.5% or better and is subject to further optimisation. In conclusion, helium imaging appears to offer higher spatial resolution compared to proton imaging. In future studies, the advantage of helium imaging compared to other imaging modalities in clinical applications will be further explored.",Computed Tomography; Helium; Particle Imaging; Proton; Radiography; Resolution; Stopping Power.

In order to reduce the negative impact of sports tourism on the environment, the development of ecological sports tourism based on the perspective of ecology is the top priority for the healthy and sustainable development of sports tourism. On the basis of summarizing and analyzing the previous research results, this paper expounds the elements and value of ecological sports culture tourism resources, introduces the ecological sports tourism complex model of landscape environmental culture belt, and expounds the cultural connotation characteristics of ecological sports tourism environment. Environmental science is mainly reflected in the promotion of the benign cycle of natural ecological environment, the protection of living things, the protection of water bodies and the treatment of water pollution, and the good protection of atmospheric environment, geology, and geomorphology. Based on the development of ecological sports tourism space with landscape environment culture belt, this paper introduces the resource development system of Beijing-Hangzhou Canal ecological sports culture tourism, constructs the landscape space development mode of ecological sports tourism, and analyzes the landscape space structure of ecological sports tourism. Based on landscape culture with the basis of sports tourism resources, analyzes the influence factors of sports tourism spatial structure from the direction of the depth and breadth of two dimensions expand sports events and the ecological sports cultural tourism, the depth of the fusion depth aspects emphatically at sporting events, and the ecological sports cultural tourism into the connotation of mining, breadth aspect focuses on the formats of the extension of rich and associated industries. To study the important carrier of promoting the development of ecological sports culture resources and sports industry in the Canal, to plan the layout and establish the sports culture tourism industry base reasonably, and to form the sports culture tourism industry ecosphere. The results show that the scale and speed of the development of sports tourism not only depend on the attractive sports tourism resources but also highly depend on the level of economic and social development in the region. The supply of sports tourism must take the demand of sports tourism market as the guide, combine sports activities with tourism activities in an ecological and organic way, develop various sports items to meet the needs of tourists, and realize the ecological, economic, and social benefits of ecological sports tourism.

2028,The immune response in the CNS in Theiler's virus induced demyelinating disease switches from an early adaptive response to a chronic innate-like response,"Francesca Gilli,Libin Li,Andrew R Pachner,Francesca Gilli,Libin Li,Andrew R Pachner","Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus-induced demyelinating disease (TMEV-IDD) is an important model of the progressive disability caused by irreversible CNS tissue injury, and provides an example of how a CNS pathogen can cause inflammation, demyelination, and neuronal damage. We were interested in which molecules, especially inflammatory mediators, might be upregulated in the CNS throughout TMEV-IDD. We quantitated by a real-time RT-PCR multi-gene system the expression of a pathway-focused panel of genes at 30 and 165 days post infection, characterizing both the early inflammatory and the late neurodegenerative stages of TMEV-IDD. Also, we measured 32 cytokines/chemokines by multiplex Luminex analysis in CSF specimens from early and late TMEV-IDD as well as sham-treated mice. Results indicate that, in the later stage of TMEV-IDD, activation of the innate immune response is most prominent: TLRs, type I IFN response genes, and innate immunity-associated cytokines were highly expressed in late TMEV-IDD compared to sham (p ≤ 0.0001) and early TMEV-IDD (p < 0.05). Conversely, several molecular mediators of adaptive immune response were highly expressed in early TMEV-IDD (all p ≤ 0.001). Protein detection in the CSF was broadly concordant with mRNA abundance of the corresponding gene measured by real-time RT-PCR in the spinal cord, since several cytokines/chemokines were increased in the CSF of TMEV-IDD mice. Results show a clear shift from adaptive to innate immunity from early to late TMEV-IDD, indicating that adaptive and innate immune pathways are likely involved in the development and progression of the disease to different extents.

Recent research efforts on Turkish, a less studied language with morphologically rich nature, have demonstrated the effectiveness of neural architectures on well-formed texts and yielded state-of-the art results by formulating the task as a sequence tagging problem. In this work, we empirically investigate the use of recent neural architectures (Bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) and Transformer-based networks) proposed for Turkish NER tagging in the same setting. Our results demonstrate that transformer-based networks which can model long-range context overcome the limitations of BiLSTM networks where different input features at the character, subword, and word levels are utilized. We also propose a transformer-based network with a conditional random field (CRF) layer that leads to the state-of-the-art result (95.95% f-measure) on a common dataset.

In particular, the gray whale foraging ground off Sakhalin Island consists of two distinct areas (nearshore and offshore) with the offshore feeding area exhibiting markedly high prey energy content. Based on photo-identification data collected from 2002 to 2015, we determined that gray whale use of the offshore feeding area increased with age. Pregnant females were more likely to be sighted only nearshore when nearshore prey energy and the proportion of nearshore energy from amphipods were higher. Likewise, females arriving with calves were less likely to be sighted offshore when the proportion of nearshore energy from amphipods was higher. Photo-identification effort in 2015 was increased substantially, with the intent of maximizing resighting data of individual whales to determine the relative proportion of different demographic groups utilizing the nearshore and offshore feeding areas. Comparing sighting data collected in 2015 with data from all previous years combined, mothers arriving with calves were sighted in the offshore feeding area earlier in 2015, with no evidence that they returned to forage nearshore later in the season. Other reproductive females constituted a higher proportion of the animals foraging nearshore prior to 2015, while juveniles were a higher proportion during 2015. Thus, the offshore feeding area is an important component of the gray whales' annual life cycle, particularly if nearshore prey energy continues to decline, and offshore anthropogenic activities need to be monitored and addressed.",Eschrichtius robustus; Foraging; Habitat use; Photo-identification; Prey energy; Sea of Okhotsk.

The potential pathogens in VPGS include Raltonia picketti, Acinetobacter lwoffii, Bacillus anthracis, Botrytis cinerea, and Cladosporium sphaerospermum. The network analysis indicated that airborne microbiota was associated with soil microbiota which was affected by anthropologic activities. The predicted gene functions revealed that bacterial function mainly involved metabolism, neurodegenerative diseases, and fungal trophic mode dominated by Pathotroph-Saprotroph in VPGS. These findings unveiled airborne microbiomes in VPGS so that a strategy for improving air quality can be applied to safeguard health and vegetation.",Bacteria; Biodiversity; Fungi; Pathogens; Vegetable plastic greenhouses.
2032,Partial Regret After Gender Affirmation Surgery of a 35-Year-Old Taiwanese Transgender Woman,"Wei-Chi V Shen,Bing-Hwei Shen,Wei-Chi V Shen,Bing-Hwei Shen","Gender-affirming surgery (GAS) is often sought after to alleviate the distress of those who suffer from gender dysphoria (GD). While many studies have shown that a significant percentage of people benefit from this procedure, a number of individuals later regret their decision of undergoing surgery. Studies have illustrated what regret depicts, categorizing regret based on intensity, persistency, and sources, in the hopes to prevent an unwanted irreversible intervention. Here, an in-depth interview with a 35-year-old transwoman from Taiwan who underwent feminizing GAS at the age of 31 illustrates her unique cultural upbringing and the course of her regret. Her experience best matches the characteristics of true regret and major regret based on the classifications of Pfäfflin and Wiepjes, respectively, indicating that she expected GAS to be the solution to her personal acceptance issue, but, in retrospect, regretted the diagnosis and treatment as her problems were not solved and worsened to the extent of secondary dysphoria. This case report hopes to shed light on the complexity of GD and regret after GAS, while encouraging the pre-surgical evaluation of psychological comorbidities and post-surgical psychotherapy, and ensuring that patients are informed and give full consent. In addition, more elaborate, long-term, large-scale qualitative research, especially within more conservative cultural settings, is needed.",DSM-5; Gender affirming surgery; Gender dysphoria; Regret; Transwomen.

Metabolic dysfunction in diabetes affects many different organ systems, including the cardiovascular system; it causes cardiac arrhythmias, silent myocardial ischemia, and sudden cardiac death, among others. These conditions are associated with damage to the nerves that innervate the heart, cardiac autonomic neuropathy (CAN), which is caused by various pathophysiological mechanisms. In this review, the main facts about the anatomy of cardiac innervations and the current knowledge of CAN, its pathophysiological mechanisms, and its diagnostic approach are discussed.

2035,Maximum mechanical power extraction from wind turbines using novel proposed high accuracy single-sensor-based maximum power point tracking technique,"Fathabadi, Hassan","A novel high accuracy single-sensor-based maximum power point tracking (MPPT) technique is proposed to extract maximum mechanical power from wind turbines. The technique uses only one wind speed sensor to regulate turbine speed to its optimum value, i.e., there is no need for any shaft speed sensor (tachometer), shaft power meter, shaft torque meter, etc. Instead of using a shaft speed sensor, the instant angular speed of the turbine is precisely extracted from the output voltage of the generator coupled to the turbine. A wind energy conversion system has been built to evaluate the technique performance. The proposed MPPT technique is compared with the state-of-the-art MPPT techniques, it is experimentally verified that not only the MPPT efficiency of the method is 98.04%, which is significantly more than that of others, but also its convergence time is only 18 ms, which is the shortest convergence time compared to others. Very simple structure, low cost, and very good response to sudden variations in wind speed are the other advantages. The proposed MPPT technique is novel because it provides the highest MPPT efficiency along with the shortest tracking convergence time compared to the state-of-the-art MPPT techniques for extracting maximum mechanical power from wind turbines.

However, their rate capability and durability are limited by tortuous Na+ diffusion channels and complicated phase evolution during Na+ extraction/insertion. Here we report our findings in unravelling the mechanism for dramatically enhancing the stability and rate capability of O3-NaNi0.5Mn0.5-xSbxO2 (NaNMS) by substitutional Sb doping, which can alter the coordination environment and chemical bonds of the transition metal (TM) ions in the structure, resulting in a more stable structure with wider Na+ transport channels. Furthermore, NaNMS nanoparticles are obtained by surface energy regulation during grain growth. The synergistic effect of Sb doping and nanostructuring greatly reduces the ionic migration energy barrier while increasing the reversibility of the structural evolution during repeated Na+ extraction/insertion. An optimized NaNMS-1 electrode delivers a reversible capacity of 212.3 mAh g-1 at 0.2 C and 74.5 mAh g-1 at 50 C with minimal capacity loss after 100 cycles at a low temperature of -20 °C.

They enable bacteria to cope with a wide range of environmental conditions via the sensing of stimuli and the transduction of the signal into an appropriate cellular adaptation response. Pseudomonas aeruginosa possesses one of the richest arrays of TCSs in bacteria and they have been the subject of intense investigation for more than 20 years. Most of the P. aeruginosa TCSs characterized to date affect its pathogenesis, via the regulation of virulence factors expression, modulation of the synthesis of antibiotic/antimicrobial resistance mechanisms, and/or via linking virulence to energy metabolism. Here, we give an overview of the current knowledge on P. aeruginosa TCSs, citing key examples for each of the above-mentioned regulatory actions. We then conclude by mentioning few small molecule inhibitors of P. aeruginosa TCSs that have shown an antimicrobial action in vitro.",Antibiotic resistance; Biofilm; Histidine kinase; Metal homeostasis; Response regulator; Two-component systems; Virulence.

Using a generative evolution fitness model trained to capture variation patterns in natural sequences, we designed artificial sequences of a proteinaceous inhibitor of pectin methylesterase enzymes. These inhibitors have considerable industrial interest to avoid phase separation in fruit juice manufacturing or reduce methanol in distillates, averting chromatographic passages triggering unwanted aroma loss. Six out of seven designs with up to 30 % divergence to other inhibitor sequences are functional and two have improved thermal stability.

2039,Deep Neural Network for Respiratory Sound Classification in Wearable Devices Enabled by Patient Specific Model Tuning,"Acharya, Jyotibdha; Basu, Arindam","The primary objective of this paper is to build classification models and strategies to identify breathing sound anomalies (wheeze, crackle) for automated diagnosis of respiratory and pulmonary diseases. In this work we propose a deep CNN-RNN model that classifies respiratory sounds based on Mel-spectrograms. We also implement a patient specific model tuning strategy that first screens respiratory patients and then builds patient specific classification models using limited patient data for reliable anomaly detection. Moreover, we devise a local log quantization strategy for model weights to reduce the memory footprint for deployment in memory constrained systems such as wearable devices. The proposed hybrid CNN-RNN model achieves a score of 66.31% on four-class classification of breathing cycles for ICBHI'17 scientific challenge respiratory sound database. When the model is re-trained with patient specific data, it produces a score of 71.81% for leave-one-out validation. The proposed weight quantization technique achieves approximate to 4x reduction in total memory cost without loss of performance. The main contribution of the paper is as follows: Firstly, the proposed model is able to achieve state of the art score on the ICBHI'17 dataset. Secondly, deep learning models are shown to successfully learn domain specific knowledge when pre-trained with breathing data and produce significantly superior performance compared to generalized models. Finally, local log quantization of trained weights is shown to be able to reduce the memory requirement significantly.

2040,A non-factoid question answering system for prior art search,"Zihayat, Morteza; Etwaroo, Rochelle","A patent gives the owner of an invention the exclusive rights to make, use and sell their invention. Before a new patent application is filed, patent lawyers are required to engage in Prior Art Search to determine the likelihood that an invention is novel, valid or to make sense of the domain. To perform this search, existing platforms utilize keywords and Boolean Logic, which disregards the syntax and semantics of natural language and thus, making the search extremely difficult. Consequently, studies regarding semantics using neural embeddings exist, but these only consider a narrow number of unidirectional words. In this study, we propose an end-to-end framework to consider bidirectional semantics, syntax and the thematic nature of natural language for prior art search. The proposed framework goes beyond keywords as input queries and takes a patent as the input. The contributions of this paper is twofold; adapting pre-trained embedding models (e.g., BERT) to address the semantics and syntax of language, followed by the second component, which exploits topic modeling to build a diversified answer that covers all themes across domains of the input patent. We evaluate the performance of the proposed framework on the CLEF-IP 2011 benchmark dataset and a real-world dataset obtained from Google patent repository and show that the proposed framework outperforms existing methods and returns meaningful results for a given patent.",Question answering; Prior art search; Pre-trained embeddings; Topic modeling; Search diversification; Sensemaking
2041,Temporal analysis of skeletal muscle remodeling post hindlimb ischemia reveals intricate autophagy regulation,"Mattia Scalabrin,Viktor Engman,Amanda Maccannell,Annabel Critchlow,Lee D Roberts,Nadira Yuldasheva,T Scott Bowen,Mattia Scalabrin,Viktor Engman,Amanda Maccannell,Annabel Critchlow,Lee D Roberts,Nadira Yuldasheva,T Scott Bowen","Hind limb ischemia (HLI) is the most severe form of peripheral arterial disease, associated with a substantial reduction of limb blood flow that impairs skeletal muscle homeostasis to promote functional disability. The molecular regulators of HLI-induced muscle perturbations remain poorly defined. This study investigated whether changes in the molecular catabolic-autophagy signaling network were linked to temporal remodeling of skeletal muscle in HLI. HLI was induced in mice via hindlimb ischemia (femoral artery ligation) and confirmed by Doppler echocardiography. Experiments were terminated at time points defined as early- (7 days; n = 5) or late- (28 days; n = 5) stage HLI. Ischemic and nonischemic (contralateral) limb muscles were compared. Ischemic versus nonischemic muscles demonstrated overt remodeling at early-HLI but normalized at late-HLI. Early-onset fiber atrophy was associated with excessive autophagy signaling in ischemic muscle; protein expression increased for Beclin-1, LC3, and p62 (P < 0.05) but proteasome-dependent markers were reduced (P < 0.05). Mitophagy signaling increased in early-stage HLI that aligned with an early and sustained loss of mitochondrial content (P < 0.05). Upstream autophagy regulators, Sestrins, showed divergent responses during early-stage HLI (Sestrin2 increased while Sestrin1 decreased; P < 0.05) in parallel to increased AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) phosphorylation (P < 0.05) and lower antioxidant enzyme expression. No changes were found in markers for mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 signaling. These data indicate that early activation of the sestrin-AMPK signaling axis may regulate autophagy to stimulate rapid and overt muscle atrophy in HLI, which is normalized within weeks and accompanied by recovery of muscle mass. A complex interplay between Sestrins to regulate autophagy signaling during early-to-late muscle remodeling in HLI is likely.",autophagy; ischemia; sestrins; skeletal muscle.
2042,Adaptive algorithm for spreading factor selection in LoRaWAN networks with multiple gateways,"Loubany, Ali; Lahoud, Samer; El Chall, Rida","Recently, LoRaWAN has been considered a promising technology for large-scale IoT applications owing to its ability to achieve low power and long range communications. However, LoRaWAN is limited using Aloha random access scheme. When in dense scenarios, such scheme leads to a high number of collisions, thus severely impacts the reliability and scalability of LoRaWAN. In this paper, we investigate the impact of scalability and densification of nodes and gateways on the system reliability taking into account the capture effect. We propose an optimization problem to derive the node distribution at different spreading factors (SF) in LoRaWAN networks with multiple gateways. We then introduce an adaptive algorithm that enables to easily implement SF optimization by adjusting the signal-to-noise ratio thresholds. Moreover, the performance of the proposed algorithm is compared with the performance of legacy LoRaWAN and relevant algorithms from the state-of-the-art. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms, and improves the throughput and packet delivery ratio of the network.",Internet of thing; LoRaWAN; Aloha; Scalability; Spreading factors; Adaptive algorithm; Capture effect

The thermal cyclization also occurs in the solution and molten states, but less efficiently, suggesting that these cyclization reactions are aided by molecular pre-organization, although not strictly topochemically controlled. Crystal structures of two carbonates and a thiocarbonate clearly revealed that the relative orientation of the electrophile and the nucleophile in the crystal lattice facilitates the intramolecular cyclization reaction and forbids the intermolecular reaction. The correlation observed between the chemical reactivity and the non-covalent interactions in the crystal of the reactants provides a way to estimate the chemical stability of analogous molecules in the solid state.",crystal engineering; cyclitols; inositols; nucleophilic substitution; solid-phase synthesis.

2046,The Impact of Cache and Dynamic Memory Management in Static Dataflow Applications,"Ghasemi, Alemeh; Ruaro, Marcelo; Cataldo, Rodrigo; Diguet, Jean-Philippe; Martin, Kevin J. M.","Dataflow is a parallel and generic model of computation that is agnostic of the underlying multi/many-core architecture executing it. State-of-the-art frameworks allow fast development of dataflow applications providing memory, communicating, and computing optimizations by design time exploration. However, the frameworks usually do not consider cache memory behavior when generating code. A generally accepted idea is that bigger and multi-level caches improve the performance of applications. This work evaluates such a hypothesis in a broad experiment campaign adopting different multi-core configurations related to the number of cores and cache parameters (size, sharing, controllers). The results show that bigger is not always better, and the foreseen future of more cores and bigger caches do not guarantee software-free better performance for dataflow applications. Additionally, this work investigates the adoption of two memory management strategies for dataflow applications: Copy-on-Write (CoW) and Non-Temporal Memory transfers (NTM). Experimental results addressing state-of-the-art applications show that NTM and CoW can contribute to reduce the execution time to -5.3% and -15.8%, respectively. CoW, specifically, shows improvements up to -21.8% in energy consumption with -16.8% of average among 22 different cache configurations.",Multi-core; Dataflow; Cache memory; Compilers
2047,A new relative chain code in 3D,"Sanchez-Cruz, Hermilo; Lopez-Valdez, Hiram H.; Cuevas, Francisco J.","A new chain code to represent 3D discrete curves is proposed. The method is based on a search for relative changes in the 3D Euclidean space, composed of three main vectors: a reference vector, a support vector, and a change direction vector, utilized to obtain a directed simple path in a grid of 26 connected components. A set of rotation transformations is defined in the 3D Euclidean space, and an alphabet of only 25 symbols is required to represent any face, edge or vertex-connected discrete curve. Important properties of this code are found: independence under translation, rotation and mirror transformations, as well as high compression levels. A set of 3D curve-skeletons and digital elevation model data to study the terrain were utilized to prove the proposed code. Compared with the state-of-the-art, our method has more advantages: at first, it represents voxelized paths independently of vicinity, also it gives better representation for the tested objects and detects better the redundant parts. This fact is shown in the entropy calculated for 3D curve-skeletons: our method gives 3.03 bits/symbol, whereas the state-of-the-art method gives 435 bits/symbol. On the other hand, our proposed chain code uses 23% less memory than the well known Freeman code of 26 directions. In case of digital elevation models, our method improves memory for 36.1% regarding Freeman code and 10.7% regarding the well known relative code called orthogonal direction change chain code. Finally, average length of the chain code proposed is 14% shorter than the relative code of the state-of-the-art. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The experimental strategy is based on the anchoring of biological material at screen-printed carbon electrode (SPE) modified with electrodeposited Graphene Quantum Dots (GQD) and polyhydroxybutyric acid (PHB). It was used as functional substract basis for the recognition site receptor-binding domain (RBD) from coronavirus spike protein (SARS-CoV-2), for the detection of Anti-S antibodies (AbS). SEM images and EDS spectra suggest an interaction of the protein with GQD-PHB sites at the electrode surface.

Using the optimal experimental conditions, analytical curves were performed in PBS and human serum spiked with AbS showing a slight matrix effect and a relationship between voltametric signal and AbS concentration in the range of 100 ng mL-1 and 10 μg mL-1. The selectivity of the proposed sensor was tested against yellow fever antibodies (YF) and the selective layer on the electrode surface did not interact with these unspecific antibodies. Eight samples of blood serum were analyzed and 87.5% of these total investigated provided adequate results. In addition, the present approach showed better results against traditional EDC/NHS reaction with enhancements in time and the possibility to develop an immunosensor in a single drop, since the proteins can be anchored prior to the electrode modification step.",Carbon nanomaterial; Electrochemical devices; Immunosensors construction.

Typically, partitioning is conducted without regard to the task in hand. We propose a task-specific image partitioning framework to produce a region-based image representation that will lead to a higher task performance than that reached using any task-oblivious partitioning framework and existing supervised partitioning framework, albeit few in number. The proposed method partitions the image by means of correlation clustering, maximizing a linear discriminant function defined over a superpixel graph. The parameters of the discriminant function that define task-specific similarity/dissimilarity among superpixels are estimated based on structured support vector machine (S-SVM) using task-specific training data. The S-SVM learning leads to a better generalization ability while the construction of the superpixel graph used to define the discriminant function allows a rich set of features to be incorporated to improve discriminability and robustness. We evaluate the learned task-aware partitioning algorithms on three benchmark datasets. Results show that task-aware partitioning leads to better labeling performance than the partitioning computed by the state-of-the-art general-purpose and supervised partitioning algorithms.

This paper aims to present an overview of the current research on the involvement of cognitive processes in semantic processing tasks and discuss the proposed relationship between cognitive control and semantic processing in aphasia.Method: The role of cognitive processes in semantic processing tasks commonly used in the aphasiology literature is discussed and two theoretical approaches to semantic processing that contribute to the understanding of the nature of semantic breakdown in aphasia are outlined. Finally, we examine the evidence put forward in the Controlled Semantic Cognition framework with regard to the interpretation of impaired performance on semantic processing tasks in people with aphasia.Result: Non-linguistic cognitive abilities such as working memory, inhibition and control are required by semantic processing tasks, in addition to access to conceptual information, making it difficult to dissociate these abilities. Several issues exist regarding the evidence put forward for a control deficit as the underlying cause of poor performance on semantic processing tasks in aphasia.Conclusion: It remains unclear whether impairment on semantic tasks in people with aphasia is related to problems with the representation and/or processing (activation/retrieval) of meaning or problems with cognitive control (or both). Further research is still needed to fully understand how non-linguistic cognitive processes interact with semantic processing, as well as clarify and consistency the definition of control.",Aphasia; cognitive-linguistic interactions; semantics.

Further, the development of automated analyses has been hindered by the subtle nature of mTBI abnormalities, which appear as low contrast MR regions. This paper proposes an approach that is able to detect mTBI lesions by combining both the high-level context and low-level visual information. The contextual model estimates the progression of the disease using subject information, such as the time since injury and the knowledge about the location of mTBI. The visual model utilizes texture features in MRI along with a probabilistic support vector machine to maximize the discrimination in unimodal MR images. These two models are fused to obtain a final estimate of the locations of the mTBI lesion. The models are tested using a novel rodent model of repeated mTBI dataset. The experimental results demonstrate that the fusion of both contextual and visual textural features outperforms other state-of-the-art approaches. Clinically, our approach has the potential to benefit both clinicians by speeding diagnosis and patients by improving clinical care.",Brain injury; contextual modeling; magnetic resonance imaging (MRI); textural modeling

To train the video summarization network, we exploit a reinforcement learning-based framework with an explicit reward function. We employ the objective function of the exploring under-appreciated reward method for training efficiently. In addition, we present a modified reconstruction loss to promote the representativeness of the summary. We evaluate the proposed method on two datasets, SumMe and TVSum. The experimental result showed that Interp-SUM generates the most natural sequence of summary frames than any other the state-of-the-art methods.

Sas2-mediated H4 K16Ac is strongest over the coding region of genes with low expression. However, it is unclear how Sas2-mediated acetylation is incorporated into chromatin. Our previous work has shown physical interactions of SAS-I with the histone chaperones CAF-I and Asf1, suggesting a link between SAS-I-mediated acetylation and chromatin assembly. Here, we find that Sas2-dependent H4 K16Ac in bulk histones requires passage of the cells through the S-phase of the cell cycle, and the rate of increase in H4 K16Ac depends on both CAF-I and Asf1, whereas steady-state levels and genome-wide distribution of H4 K16Ac show only mild changes in their absence. Furthermore, H4 K16Ac is deposited in chromatin at genes upon repression, and this deposition requires the histone chaperone Spt6, but not CAF-I, Asf1, HIR or Rtt106. Altogether, our data indicate that Spt6 controls H4 K16Ac levels by incorporating K16-unacetylated H4 in strongly transcribed genes. Upon repression, Spt6 association is decreased, resulting in less deposition of K16-unacetylated H4 and therefore in a concomitant increase of H4 K16Ac that is recycled during transcription.",Cac1; Sas2; Sas4; chromatin assembly; histone acetylation; replication.
2055,MyStoryPlayer: experiencing multiple audiovisual content for education and training,"Bellini, Pierfrancesco; Nesi, Paolo; Serena, Marco","There are several education and training cases where multi-camera view is a traditional way to work: performing arts and news, medical surgical actions, sport actions, instruments playing, speech training, etc. In most cases, users need to interact with multi camera and multi audiovisual to create among audiovisual segments their own relations and annotations with the purpose of: comparing actions, gesture and posture; explaining actions; providing alternatives, etc. Most of the present solutions are based on custom players and/or specific applications which force to create custom streams from server side, thus leading to restrictions on the user activity as to establishing dynamically additional relations. Web based solutions would be more appreciated and are complex to be realized for the problems related to the video desynchronization. In this paper, MyStoryPlayer/ECLAP solution is presented. The major contributions to the state of the art are related to: (i) the semantic model to formalize the relationships and play among audiovisual determining synchronizations, (ii) the model and modality to save and share user experiences in navigating among lessons including several related and connected audiovisual, (iii) the design and development of algorithm to shorten the production of relationships among media, (iv) the design and development of the whole system including its user interaction model, and (v) the solution and algorithm to keep the desynchronizations limited among media in the event of low network bandwidth. The proposed solution has been developed for and it is in use within ECLAP (European Collected Library of Performing Arts) for accessing and commenting performing arts training content. The paper also reports validation results about performance assessment and tuning, and about the usage of tools on ECLAP services. In ECLAP, users may navigate in the audiovisual relationships, thus creating and sharing experience paths. The resulting solution includes a uniform semantic model, a corresponding semantic database for the knowledge, a distribution server for semantic knowledge and media, and the MyStoryPlayer Client for web applications.",Audiovisual relations; Educational tools; Annotation tool; Multi video synchronization
2056,Long-Term Person Tracking for Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Based on Human-Machine Collaboration,"Zhou, Tongtong; Liu, Yadong","Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) has been widely used in military reconnaissance, smart transportation, public security and other fields. UAV-based person tracking is attracting incremental attention for its wide application requirements. Currently, some state-of-the-art visual tracking methods have achieved promising performance in common scenarios. However, in the scene of UAV-based person tracking, there will be long-term target disappearance and unpredictable dramatic target appearance changes, which still pose a huge challenge to UAV-based person tracking. In this work, a human-machine hybrid augmented tracking system based on eye tracking is proposed to cope with the challenge. During tracking, through the interaction between humans and machines, humans can provide real-time guidance and corrections to the tracker, and the tracker can also learn interesting targets from humans to enhance itself. The experimental results show that human-in-the-loop can remarkable improve the success rate and robustness of the tracking and our tracking system outperforms the state-of-the-art tracker in complex environments.",Target tracking; Visualization; Autonomous aerial vehicles; Tracking loops; Man-machine systems; Licenses; Collaboration; UAV-based person tracking; human-in-the-loop; gaze-based human computer interaction; human-machine collaboration; long-term tracking
2057,A General Framework for First Story Detection Utilizing Entities and Their Relations,"Panagiotou, Nikolaos; Akkaya, Cem; Tsioutsiouliklis, Kostas; Kalogeraki, Vana; Gunopulos, Dimitrios","News portals, such as Yahoo News or Google News, collect large amounts of news articles from a variety of sources on a daily basis. Only a small portion of these documents can be selected and displayed on the homepage. Thus, there is a strong preference for major, recent events. In this work, we propose a scalable First Story Detection (FSD) pipeline that identifies fresh news. This pipeline is used in order to instantiate a variety of FSD approaches. In addition we suggest a novel FSD technique that in comparison to existing systems, relies on relation extraction algorithms and exploits the named entities and their relations in order to decide about the freshness of an article. We evaluate our technique by instantiating existing state of art FSD techniques within our generic pipeline. As ground truth we use multiple datasets that cover different categories. Experimental results demonstrate that our FSD method in many cases provides an improvement over state-of-the-art techniques. In addition, we show using a large synthetic dataset that our general FSD pipeline has constant space and time requirements and is suitable for very high volume streams.",Pipelines; Feature extraction; Task analysis; Art; Event detection; Knowledge engineering; Data engineering; Information retrieval; event detection
2058,Highly fluorescent nickel based metal organic framework for enhanced sensing of Fe3+ and Cr2O72- ions,"Jasjot Kaur,Manjot Kaur,Sushil Kumar Kansal,Ahmad Umar,Hassan Algadi,Jasjot Kaur,Manjot Kaur,Sushil Kumar Kansal,Ahmad Umar,Hassan Algadi","Heavy metal contamination has sparked widespread concern among the populace. The significant issues necessitate the creation of high-performance fluorescent pigments that can identify harmful elements in water. The present study deals with metal organic framework [MOF] based on nickel [Ni-BDC MOF]. The Ni-BDC MOF was prepared by facile solvothermal method using nickel nitrate hexahydrate and terephthalic acid ligand as precursors. The MOF was characterized by various techniques in order to examine the crystal, morphological, structural, composition, thermal and optical properties. The detailed characterizations revealed that the synthesized Ni-BDC MOF are well-crystalline with high purity and possessing 3D rhombohedral microcrystals with rough surface. The MOF demonstrate good luminescence performance and excellent water stability. According to the Stern Volmer plot, the tests set up under optimized conditions demonstrate a linear correlation between the fluorescence intensity and concentration of both ions, i.e. Fe3+, and Cr2O72- ions. The linear range and detection limit for Fe3+ and Cr2O72- were found to be 0-1.4 nM and 0.159 nM, and 0-1 nM and 0.120 nM, respectively. The mechanisms for the selective detection of cations and anions were also explored. The recyclability for the prepared MOF was checked up to five cycles which showed excellent stability with just a slight reduction in efficiency. The constructed sensor was also used to assess the presence of Fe3+ and Cr2O72- ions in actual water samples. The results of the different experiments revealed that the prepared MOF is a good material for detecting Fe3+ and Cr2O72- ions.",Fe(3+) cation and Cr(2)O(7)(2−) anion; Luminescence detection; Ni-organic framework.
2059,IENet: Internal and External Patch Matching ConvNet for Web Image Guided Denoising,"Yue, Huanjing; Liu, Jianjun; Yang, Jingyu; Sun, Xiaoyan; Nguyen, Truong Q.; Wu, Feng","From the non-local self-similarity (NSS)-based image denoising to the convolutional-network (ConvNet)-based image denoising, the denoising performance has been greatly improved. However, it is still not clear how to utilize similar web images to guide image denoising using ConvNet. This paper proposes a novel ConvNet for image denoising to explore both internal (NSS) and external correlations when external similar images are available. Since external similar images may be taken with different viewpoints, focal lengths, and may contain different objects, it is difficult to directly explore external correlations at image level using ConvNet. Therefore, we propose an internal and external patch matching ConvNet (IENet), whose inputs are similar patch cubes extracted from the noisy input and its external similar images. We design three different network structures, namely early-fusion, middle-fusion, and late-fusion of the internal and external cubes to fully combine the strengths of internal and external correlations. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves the best denoising results compared with the seven state-of-the-art denoising methods. In specific, the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art web image guided denoising method by more than 1 dB on average, which further demonstrates the superiority of the proposed IENet-based filtering over the hand-crafted filtering methods.",Image denoising; external correlations; internal correlations; web images; internal and external patch matching ConvNet (IENet)
2060,Cumulative dual-branch network framework for long-tailed multi-class classification,"Fan, Saite; Zhang, Xinmin; Song, Zhihuan; Shao, Weiming","The long-tailed data distribution problem (i.e., a few classes account for majority data, while most classes account for minority data) is widespread in large-scale and real-world datasets, and it poses a huge challenge to the computer vision field. Existing methods of long-tailed classification mainly focus on re-sampling, re-weighting, and transfer learning. Although class imbalance learning can yield better long-tailed classification performance, the feature representative ability of the feature extraction network is damaged to a certain extent. To deal with these issues, the present work proposes a novel cumulative dual-branch network framework (CDBNF), which takes into account the class imbalance learning and feature representation learning at the same time by the dual-branch network architecture. In CDBNF, the class imbalance learning branch greatly improves the classification performance of tail classes, while the few-shot learning branch enhances the feature representative ability. Furthermore, a cumulative learning strategy (CLS) is proposed in CDBNF to make it pay more attention to the tail classes gradually in the training process. The effectiveness and practicability of the proposed CDBNF are verified by the four benchmark datasets. Experimental results show that the classification performance of CDBNF is superior to other state-of-the-art methods, while the intra-class feature variance is smaller than other state-of-the-art methods.",Long-tail problem; Class imbalance learning; Few-shot learning; Cumulative learning strategy

2062,Two distinct conformational states of Mycobacterium tuberculosis virulent factor early secreted antigenic target 6 kDa are behind the discrepancy around its biological functions,"Amira Refai,Meriam Haoues,Houcemeddine Othman,Mohamed Ridha Barbouche,Philippe Moua,Arnaud Bondon,Liza Mouret,Najet Srairi-Abid,Makram Essafi,Amira Refai,Meriam Haoues,Houcemeddine Othman,Mohamed Ridha Barbouche,Philippe Moua,Arnaud Bondon,Liza Mouret,Najet Srairi-Abid,Makram Essafi","Early secreted antigenic target 6 kDa (ESAT-6) and culture filtrate protein 10 kDa (CFP-10) are complex proteins secreted by Mycobacterium tuberculosis that play a major role in the pathogenesis of tuberculosis. However, studies focusing on the biological functions of ESAT-6 led to discordant results and the role of ESAT-6 remains controversial. In the present study, we aim to address a potential explanation for this discrepancy and to highlight the physiological impact of two conformational states of ESAT-6. Analysis of a recombinant form of ESAT-6 by native gel electrophoresis, size exclusion chromatography and CD spectroscopy revealed that ESAT-6 forms dimers/multimers with higher molecular weight, which disappeared under the action of the detergent amidosulfobetaine-14 (ASB), giving rise to another conformational state of the protein. NMR has further indicated that ASB-treated versus nontreated ESAT-6 adopted distinct structural forms but with no well defined tertiary structure. However, protein-protein docking analysis favored a dimeric state of ESAT-6. Interestingly, the two preparations presented opposing effects on mycobacterial infectivity, as well as macrophage survival, interferon-γ secretion and membrane pore formation. Thereafter, we generated a recombinant form of the physiological heterodimer ESAT-6/CFP-10 that ASB was also able to dissociate and which showed functions similar to those of ESAT-6 dimers/multimers. Our data suggest that, in the absence of CFP-10, the hydrophobic regions of the ESAT-6 can form dimers/multimers, mimicking the ESAT-6/CFP-10 heterodimer, whereas their dissociation generates a protein presenting entirely different activities. Overall, the present study clarifies the intriguing divergences between reports that could be attributed to the ESAT-6 oligomeric state and sheds light on its importance for a better comprehension of the physiopathology of tuberculosis.",ESAT-6; biological functions; discrepancy; structure; tuberculosis.

Because the X-ray photon energy separation is better with PCD CT than conventional EID-based dual-energy CT, it has the potential to improve virtual monochromatic- and virtual non-contrast images, material decomposition including quantification of the iodine distribution, and K-edge imaging. Therefore, its clinical applicability may be increased. Although the image quality of PCD CT scans is superior to that of EID CT currently, further improvement may be possible. The introduction of iterative image reconstruction and reconstruction with deep convolutional neural networks will be useful.",Energy separation; Energy-integrating detector CT; K-edge imaging; Photon-counting detector CT; Spatial resolution.
2064,Accurate 3D motion tracking by combining image alignment and feature matching,"Chen, Shu; Liang, Luming; Ouyang, Jianquan; Yuan, Yuan","We presents a novel method to improve the accuracy of 3D motion tacking. In contrast to the state-of-the-art tracking approaches, where the 3D structure of target is commonly approximated by a CAD model, the proposed method establishes the target model by an online improved Structure-from-Motion technique. Furthermore, the tracking is implemented by three sequential trackers (feature-based tracker, image-alignment-based tracker and Particle Filter), which continually refine the tracking results. This coarse-to-fine method increases the accuracy of tracking. Moreover, our approach uses keyframe strategy to prevent tracking drift, the new keyframe insertion is determined by a criterion which can ensure a correct update. Thorough evaluations are performed on two public databases, the Biwi Head Pose dataset and the UPNA Head Pose Database. Comparisons illustrate that the proposed method achieves better performance with respect to other state-of-the-art tracking approaches.",Pose estimation; Model establishment; Image alignment; Motion tracking
2065,Mobile Code Anti-Reversing Scheme Based on Bytecode Trapping in ART,"Na, Geonbae; Lim, Jongsu; Lee, Sunjun; Yi, Jeong Hyun","As interest in Internet of Things environments rapidly increases throughout the IT convergence field, compatibility with mobile devices must be provided to enable personalized services. The security of mobile platforms and applications is critical because security vulnerabilities of mobile devices can be spread to all things in these environments. Android, the leading open mobile platform, has long used the Dalvik virtual machine as its runtime system. However, it has recently been completely replaced by a new runtime system, namely Android Runtime (ART). The change from Android's Dalvik to ART means that the existing Dalvik bytecode-based application execution structure has been changed to a machine code-based application execution structure. Consequently, a detailed understanding of ART, such as new file formats and execution switching methods between codes, is required from the viewpoint of application security. In this paper, we demonstrate that an existing Dalvik-based application vulnerability can be exploited as-is in ART. This is because existing Dalvik executable files coexist in the ART executable file, and these Dalvik bytecodes and compiled machine codes have one-to-one mapping relationships. We then propose an ART-based application protection scheme to secure this by dynamically eliminating the one-to-one mapping. In addition, the proposed scheme is implemented to evaluate its reverse engineering resistance and performance through experiments.",internet of things; reverse engineering; Dalvik; ART; mobile code protection

E.","We present an Iterated Local Search (ILS) algorithm for solving the single-machine scheduling problem with sequence-dependent setup times to minimize the total weighted tardiness. The proposed ILS algorithm exhibits several distinguishing features, including a new neighborhood structure called Block Move and a fast incremental evaluation technique, for evaluating neighborhood solutions. Applying the proposed algorithm to solve 120 public benchmark instances widely used in the literature, we achieve highly competitive results compared with a recently proposed exact algorithm and five sets of best solutions of state-of-the-art metaheuristic algorithms in the literature. Specifically, ILS obtains the optimal solutions for 113 instances within a reasonable time, and it outperforms the previous best-known results obtained by metaheuristic algorithms for 34 instances and matches the best results for 82 instances. In addition, ILS is able to obtain the optimal solutions for the remaining seven instances under a relaxed time limit, and its computational efficiency is comparable with the state-of-the-art exact algorithm by Tanaka and Araki (Comput Oper Res 40:344-352, 2013). Finally, on analyzing some important features that affect the performance of ILS, we ascertain the significance of the proposed Block Move neighborhood and the fast incremental evaluation technique.",Single-machine scheduling; Total weighted tardiness; Sequence dependent setup; Iterated Local Search; Block Move

Thus, the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) methodology was applied under a 'cradle-to-port' approach, setting the functional unit as 1 kg of fresh fish landed. Inventory data on the main inputs and outputs were collected from a sample of 57 vessels covering for the first time the main tech-niques, purse seine and minor art fisheries.The results identified that the vessel use stage was the responsible of most of the impacts. In line with the literature, diesel consumption stood as the chief hotspot in six of the seven impact categories analysed. Purse seiners got a value of 0.25 kg of fuel per kg of fish landed, while the performance of the minor art fleet showed significantly lower consumption (0.07). Regarding impacts on climate change, this study found a quantity of 1.00 and 0.34 kg CO2 eq. per FU, for purse seine and minor arts, respectively. These figures were consistent with the expected results for pelagic fisheries. For the remaining indicators, purse seiners generally performed worse.The LCA methodology provided outcomes that allow the proposal of potential improvements and measures to foster the transition towards a more sustainable smart-fishing sector. Further research efforts should focus on the develop-ment and implementation of renewable energy and low-carbon vessel propulsion technologies.",Environmental footprint; Life cycle assessment; Minor arts; Pelagic fisheries; Purse seine

PGNT and rosette-forming glioneuronal tumors (RGNT) are recently identified, unusual glioneuronal tumor variants which were categorized as novel tumor entities in the 2007 World Health Organization classification system. The molecular background of these tumors remains poorly understood due to the paucity of studies. The SLC44A1-PRKCA fusion was recently detected in three cases of PGNT. We invesitgated for the SLC44A1-PRKCA fusion protein in the three PGNT patients and a further two with RGNT using fluorescence in situ hybridization. Two out of the three PGNT patients had a fused signal (paired red-green signal) representing a rearrangement on chromosomes 9 and 17. A normal signal pattern was observed in the third PGNT patient. Neither of the two RGNT patients demonstrated a fused signal. This suggests that the SLC44A1-PRKCA fusion is a characteristic alteration in PGNT but not RGNT. Therefore, it is a potential biomarker of PGNT. The paired red-green signal that was observed in the PGNT patients implies the presence of a different breakpoint than that previously reported in the 9q31 and 17q24 genes.",Fluorescence in situ hybridization; Papillary glioneuronal tumor; Rosette-forming glioneuronal tumor; SLC44A–PRKCA fusion.

How can we understand and interpret this rock art? Why the images? Why do the bovidian representations of daily life in the Saharan Neolithic with surprising realism give way to schematic images and cryptic imprints that express the existential uncertainties of ""Round Head"" societies confronted with a changing world? In distinguishing the myth, substance of the collective unconscious, from the mythological stories that it generates, the present author brings forth in successive stages the underlying logic of these astonishing compositions. Drawing on the combined methods of prehistoric archaeology, art history, and sociocultural anthropology, I illustrate the principles for an anthropology of rock art. Finally, in placing these results in the context of the prehistoric Saharan ecology, I indicate the potential causes of tension and conflict among the groups of pastoral nomads. Before aridity and desertification favored the emergence of a protohistoric society of merchants and warriors, the Bovidian groups established the conditions that allowed for the rise and maintenance of a grand pastoral civilization. The stories that captured the essence of this society are lost forever, but the mythological system that generated them remains fleetingly visible. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA.

2072,VARID: Viewpoint-Aware Re-IDentification of Vehicle Based on Triplet Loss,"Li, Yidong; Liu, Kai; Jin, Yi; Wang, Tao; Lin, Weipeng","With the increasing prevalence of intelligent traffic control and monitoring, research on vehicle re-identification (Re-ID) draws substantial attention in recent years. Different from other cross-view searching tasks such as person Re-ID, the vehicle Re-ID problem is more challenging and unpredictable as viewpoint variations can greatly affect the appearance of vehicles. Existing studies mainly focus on extracting global features based on visual appearance to represent the identity of the target vehicle, while the impact of viewpoint variation is rarely considered. In this paper, we take the view information into account to boost vehicle Re-ID, and introduce latent view labels by clustering and incorporates view information into deep metric learning to tackle the challenge. We also develop a stricter center constraint to further improve the intra-class compactness of feature space. Moreover, we adopt an orthogonal regularization to increase the separability between different vehicles. VARID achieves 79.3% mAP on VeRi-776 and 88.5% mAP on VehicleID which surpasses state-of-the-arts a lot. More comprehensive experimental analyses and evaluations on four benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms significantly state-of-the-arts methods.",Task analysis; Feature extraction; Measurement; Visualization; Benchmark testing; Robustness; Training; Vehicle re-identification; traffic control and monitoring; feature representation; metric learning; triplet loss

There have been many successful 3D CNN architectures surpassing state-of-the-art results successively. However, nearly all of them are designed to operate offline, creating several serious handicaps during online operation. Firstly, conventional 3D CNNs are not dynamic since their output features represent the complete input clip instead of the most recent frame in the clip. Secondly, they are not temporal resolution-preserving due to their inherent temporal downsampling. Lastly, 3D CNNs are constrained to be used with fixed temporal input size limiting their flexibility. In order to address these drawbacks, we propose dissected 3D CNNs, where the intermediate volumes of the network are dissected and propagated over depth (time) dimension for future calculations, substantially reducing the number of computations at online operation. For action classification, the dissected version of ResNet models performs 77%-90% fewer computations at online operation while achieving similar to 5% better classification accuracy on the Kinetics-600 dataset than conventional 3D-ResNet models. Moreover, the advantages of dissected 3D CNNs are demonstrated by deploying our approach onto several vision tasks, which consistently improved the performance.",Temporal skip connections; Efficient online video processing; 3D convolutional neural networks

While there is a recognition of the importance of understanding the experiences of women who undergo foetal reduction to offer appropriate help and support, studies that provide relevant insights are sparse. Our aim was to gain an in-depth understanding about first-time mothers' experiences of foetal reduction following ART treatment in Taiwan. Methods We adopted a qualitative design based on a phenomenological approach for this study. In-depth semi-structured interviews were conducted with seven first-time mothers who underwent foetal reduction following ART treatment at a fertility centre in Taipei, Taiwan. All interviews were recorded, transcribed and analysed using the Colaizzi strategy. Results The views and experiences relating to foetal reduction reflected five key themes: hesitation, ambivalence and distress; the guilt of knowingly terminating a life; rituals and ceremonies to ease the sense of guilt; persuading oneself to consider the 'big picture'; and wishing for a reunion in next pregnancy. Mothers often regretted that they took clinical advice to implant multiple embryos and then having had to resort to foetal reduction. There was a sense of hesitation, ambivalence and distress reflected in the views from all participants. They believed that they ended the fetuses' lives knowingly and expressed strong feelings of guilt. Mothers often tried to persuade themselves to look at foetal reduction within the 'big picture' of the overall pregnancy outcome. Losing their unborn babies was as an unforgettable incident for most mothers, and they wished for a reunion with the lost baby in the next pregnancy. Conclusion Findings indicate the need for ART providers to undertake a more sensitive approach that involves detailed discussions with women and their families to tailor the embryo transfer processes to suit individual needs. Women who undergo foetal reduction should be provided with tailored interventions towards enhancing their coping strategies before and after foetal reduction taking into account the cultural and religious context.",Maternal health; Foetal reduction; Assisted reproductive technology; Taiwan

As one of the most common human helminths, hookworm is a kind of small tubular structure with grayish white or pinkish semi-transparent body, which is with a number of 600 million people infection around the world. Automatic hookworm detection is a challenging task due to poor quality of images, presence of extraneous matters, complex structure of gastrointestinal, and diverse appearances in terms of color and texture. This is the first few works to comprehensively explore the automatic hookworm detection for WCE images. To capture the properties of hookworms, the multi scale dual matched filter is first applied to detect the location of tubular structure. Piecewise parallel region detection method is then proposed to identify the potential regions having hookworm bodies. To discriminate the unique visual features for different components of gastrointestinal, the histogram of average intensity is proposed to represent their properties. In order to deal with the problem of imbalance data, Rusboost is deployed to classify WCE images. Experiments on a diverse and large scale dataset with 440 K WCE images demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves a promising performance and outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, the high sensitivity in detecting hookworms indicates the potential of our approach for future clinical application.",Computer-aided detection; hookworm detection; pattern recognition and classification; wireless capsule endoscopy

State-of-the-art LS techniques assume each object is static and can only be influenced by a single facility. However, in reality, objects (e.g., people, vehicles) are mobile and are influenced by multiple facilities, which prevents classical LS solutions from selecting accurate results. In this paper, we introduce a generalized LS problem called PRIME-LS which takes mobility and probability factors into consideration to address the aforementioned limitations. Specifically, given a set of candidate locations, PRIME-LS aims to mine the optimal location which can influence the most number of moving objects. Also, to address the problem we propose an efficient algorithm called PINOCCHIO that leverages two pruning rules based on a novel distance measure. These rules enable us to prune many inferior candidate locations prior to influence computation, paving the way to efficient and accurate solution. Furthermore, we extend PINOCCHIO (PINOCCHIO-VO) by incorporating two optimization strategies during candidate validation phase, which further reduce unnecessary computations. Experimental study over two real-world datasets demonstrates superiority of our framework in comparison to state-of-the-art LS techniques.",Moving objects; location selection; spatial database

Examples typically include reversible sensors or an array of single-use sensors embedded in specialized microfluidics for temporal analysis of sweat. However, evolving this field to a level that truly represents ""lab-on-skin"" technology will require the incorporation of advanced functionalities that give the user the freedom to (1) choose the precise time for performing sample analysis and (2) select sensors from an array embedded within the device for performing condition-specific sample analysis. Here, we introduce new concepts in wearable microfluidic platforms that offer such capabilities. The described technology involves a series of finger-actuated pumps, valves, and sensors incorporated within soft, wearable microfluidics. The incoming sweat collects in the inlet chamber and can be analyzed by the user at the time of their choosing. On-demand sweat analyte assessment is achieved by pulling a thin tab to activate a pump which opens a valve and allows the pooled sweat to enter a chamber embedded with sensors for the desired analytes. The article describes a thorough characterization of the platform that demonstrates the robustness of the pumping, valving, and sensing aspects of the device under conditions mimicking real-life scenarios. A two-day-long human pilot study validates the system and illustrates the device's ability to offer on-demand, longitudinal, and multianalyte sensing. Our work represents the first example of a wearable system with such on-demand sensing capabilities and opens exciting avenues in sweat sensing for acquiring new insights into human physiology.",colorimetrics; noninvasive diagnostics; on-demand sensing; soft microfluidics; sweat sensors; wearable devices.

This study aimed to determine whether spraying bacterial or fungal solutions affected insect pests, cone development, and the seed quality of Korean pine Pinus koraiensis Sieb. et Zucc. The experiment was conducted in a forest plantation in Linkou County (Heilongjiang, China) in 2019. Four fungal strains and one bacterial strain were applied during the flowering phase of Korean pine. The results after a year and a half of study indicated that a high concentration of Bacillus thuringiensis 223176 promoted cone development, increased seed weight, and reduced the proportion of damaged cones. Under this treatment, there were 15.873% damaged cones; the seed weight reached 0.829 g, and there were 82.738% fully developed cones. Trees treated with the second most effective strain, Beauveria bassiana 122077, had 30.556% damaged cones and an average seed weight of 0.810 g. Leucanicillium antillanum 01 performed the worst in this study. The seed weight was only 0.775 g, and the damaged and fully developed cones were 52.444 and 41.773%, respectively. In summary, spraying bacterial or fungal solutions during the flowering stage of Korean pine positively impacted seed quality and effectively decreased damage by the lepidopteran species that feed on the cones and seeds in this study.",Bt spraying; Dioryctria abietella Denis & Schiffermüller; Korean pine; cone damage; flowering phase; seed quality.
2080,"Comparison of the Literacy Level on Major Environmental Issues of the GCE (A/L) Students of Different Disciplines in Kandy District, Sri Lanka","Kuruppuarachchi, Janaka; Hemadila, Palaniappan; Madurapperuma, Buddhika","The study aims to examine the environmental literacy level of G.C.E A/L students (comparable to British Advanced Level) in the Kandy District, Sri Lanka, and to evaluate environment modules embedded into the curriculum. Furthermore, we find the relationships between environmental literacy level and socioeconomic and discipline levels. A survey with a sample of 300 students was selected randomly from four different disciplines, with 25 students in each subject (biological science, mathematics, arts, and commerce) from three different types of schools (Public, Private, and International). A piloted, self-administered, and structured questionnaire with 44 items under six sections (personal background, environmental issues, attitudes, behavior, suggestion, and mitigation) was randomly distributed among the study sample. Results showed that most respondents reside in an urban area, the education level of parents was positioned in the G.C.E. (A/L) category, and the monthly total family income was more than SLR 90,000.00. Overall, the environmental literacy (EL) was similar among students of three different types of schools. The type of permanent residence, discipline, and educational background of parents were recognized as determining factors of EL levels (p < 0.05). The environmental literacy knowledge of biological science students was the highest (44%), followed by mathematics (36%), art (32%), and commerce (28%). Furthermore, the EL of the biology discipline was significantly different from commerce (18%) and art (14%) students. Students acquired environmental knowledge from television and radio (44%), internet (22%), school (27%), and parents (7%). The A/L Curriculum evaluation results proved that much less environment-related components were included in the commerce, art, and mathematics subjects. Of the disciplines, geography (35%) and biological science (11%) included a higher amount of EL knowledge, comparatively. Students suggested that recycling/ reuse of waste conserves natural resources, the green building concept, and the use of public transportation to conserve the environment. This study recommends that environmental concepts should be integrated with formal G.C.E A/L syllabus with activity learning, especially for non-science disciplines, and that environment-related television and radio programs should be enhanced.",environment literacy; school; education; subjects; GCE (A/L); Kandy; Sri Lanka
2081,Mutual Information-Based Disentangled Neural Networks for Classifying Unseen Categories in Different Domains: Application to Fetal Ultrasound Imaging,"Meng, Qingjie; Matthew, Jacqueline; Zimmer, Veronika A.; Gomez, Alberto; Lloyd, David F. A.; Rueckert, Daniel; Kainz, Bernhard","Deep neural networks exhibit limited generalizability across images with different entangled domain features and categorical features. Learning generalizable features that can form universal categorical decision boundaries across domains is an interesting and difficult challenge. This problem occurs frequently in medical imaging applications when attempts are made to deploy and improve deep learning models across different image acquisition devices, across acquisition parameters or if some classes are unavailable in new training databases. To address this problem, we propose Mutual Information-based Disentangled Neural Networks (MIDNet), which extract generalizable categorical features to transfer knowledge to unseen categories in a target domain. The proposed MIDNet adopts a semi-supervised learning paradigm to alleviate the dependency on labeled data. This is important for real-world applications where data annotation is time-consuming, costly and requires training and expertise. We extensively evaluate the proposed method on fetal ultrasound datasets for two different image classification tasks where domain features are respectively defined by shadow artifacts and image acquisition devices. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art on the classification of unseen categories in a target domain with sparsely labeled training data.",Feature extraction; Training; Task analysis; Biomedical imaging; Ultrasonic imaging; Training data; Representation disentanglement; domain adaptation; semi-supervised learning; image classification
2082,Shape geodesics for robust sign language recognition,"Nasreddine, Kamal; Benzinou, Abdesslam","In this study, a novel method of pattern recognition for static gesture recognition is proposed. To deal with this application, the authors should tackle the problem of low variability among shape classes in the gestures databases. The authors' method is based on robust registration and shape geodesics in shape space with a preliminary step of pose estimation accelerating the processing time. The different gestures are considered individual points in a non-linear shape space. Similarity between any two considered shapes can be measured by a distance metric on the shape space. For shape comparison, three distances with and without robust norm are proposed and evaluated for the target application. To cope with low shape variability among classes, the best scheme is to use robust norm in shape matching but not in shape comparison. Experiments are conducted on reference databases used in the literature to evaluate static gesture recognition. These experiments show the outperformance of the proposed scheme compared to state-of-the art methods.",image registration; pose estimation; pattern recognition; shape recognition; gesture recognition; shape geodesics; robust sign language recognition; pattern recognition; static gesture recognition; low variability; shape classes; gestures databases; authors; robust registration; different gestures; nonlinear shape space; considered shapes; shape comparison; robust norm; target application; low shape variability; shape matching; state-of-the art methods
2083,Bag of indexes: a multi-index scheme for efficient approximate nearest neighbor search,"Magliani, Federico; Fontanini, Tomaso; Prati, Andrea","During the last years, the problem of Content-Based Image Retrieval (CBIR) was addressed in many different ways, achieving excellent results in small-scale datasets. With growth of the data to evaluate, new issues need to be considered and new techniques are necessary in order to create an efficient yet accurate system. In particular, computational time and memory occupancy need to be kept as low as possible, whilst the retrieval accuracy has to be preserved as much as possible. For this reason, a brute-force approach is no longer feasible, and an Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN) search method is preferable. This paper describes the state-of-the-art ANN methods, with a particular focus on indexing systems, and proposes a new ANN technique called Bag of Indexes (BoI). This new technique is compared with the state of the art on several public benchmarks, obtaining 86.09% of accuracy on Holidays+Flickr1M, 99.20% on SIFT1M and 92.4% on GIST1M. Noteworthy, these state-of-the-art accuracy results are obtained by the proposed approach with a very low retrieval time, making it excellent in the trade off between accuracy and efficiency.",Content-based image retrieval; Approximate nearest neighbor search; Hashing; LSH
2084,How to define and assess the clinically significant causes of hematuria in childhood,"Orsolya Horváth,Attila J Szabó,George S Reusz,Orsolya Horváth,Attila J Szabó,George S Reusz","Given the wide diversity of causes of hematuria, ranging from simple urinary tract infections with rapid recovery to severe glomerulonephritis with fast decline in kidney function, it is essential to recognize the underlying disease. The first objective of the assessment is to determine whether the cause of the hematuria is medically significant. The combination of hematuria with proteinuria, the presence of hypertension, or worsening kidney function can represent signs of progressive kidney disease. Differentiating the various causes of hematuria is often simple and obvious based on the clinical signs and gross appearance of the urine. However, in some instances, additional non-invasive investigations, such as ultrasound imaging, urinary red cell morphology, measurement of calcium and other solutes in the urine, evaluation of kidney function, and protein excretion, are needed to elucidate the nature of the hematuria. Taking a detailed family history can help in establishing the underlying cause in cases of familial hematuria. On the other hand, the decision to perform a kidney biopsy in children with asymptomatic hematuria remains a challenging issue for clinicians. Ultimately, the frequency of diagnosis of glomerular involvement causing hematuria may depend on the threshold for performing a kidney biopsy. The following review will focus on the diagnostics of hematuria, starting with difficulties regarding its definition, followed by various means to differentiate between urinary, glomerular, and other causes, and finally reviewing the most common diseases that, due to their frequency or their effect on kidney function, present a diagnostic challenge in everyday practice.",Differential diagnosis; Glomerular Diseases; Hematuria; Red blood cell; Urine.

Here, we show that acute gut inflammation expands HSPCs in the BM and directs them to inflamed mesenteric lymph nodes through GM-CSFR activation for further expansion and potential differentiation into Ly6C+ /G+ myeloid cells specialized in gut tissue repair. We identified this process to be mediated by Bacteroides, a commensal gram-negative bacteria that activates innate immune signaling. These findings establish cross-organ communication between the BM and distant inflamed sites, whereby a certain subset of multipotent progenitors is specified to respond to imminent hematopoietic demands and to alleviate inflammatory symptoms.",Bacteroides; hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells; innate immune signaling; tissue-repairing cells.
2086,3D facial expression recognition using kernel methods on Riemannian manifold,"Hariri, Walid; Tabia, Hedi; Farah, Nadir; Benouareth, Abdallah; Declercq, David","Automatic human Facial Expressions Recognition (FER) is becoming of increased interest. FER finds its applications in many emerging areas such as affective computing and intelligent human computer interaction. Most of the existing work on FER has been done using 2D data which suffers from inherent problems of illumination changes and pose variations. With the development of 3D image capturing technologies, the acquisition of 3D data is becoming a more feasible task. The 3D data brings a more effective solution in addressing the issues raised by its 2D counterpart. State-of-the-art 3D FER methods are often based on a single descriptor which may fail to handle the large inter-class and intra-class variability of the human facial expressions. In this work, we explore, for the first time, the usage of covariance matrices of descriptors, instead of the descriptors themselves, in 3D FER. Since covariance matrices are elements of the non-linear manifold of Symmetric Positive Definite (SPD) matrices, we particularly look at the application of manifold-based classification to the problem of 3D FER. We evaluate the performance of the proposed framework on the BU-3DFE and the Bosphorus datasets, and demonstrate its superiority compared to the state-of-the-art methods. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

2087,Prediction and Description of Near-Future Activities in Video,"Mahmud, Tahmida; Billah, Mohammad; Hasan, Mahmudul; Roy-Chowdhury, Amit K.","Most of the existing works on human activity analysis focus on recognition or early recognition of the activity labels from complete or partial observations. Similarly, almost all of the existing video captioning approaches focus on the observed events in videos. Predicting the labels and the captions of future activities where no frames of the predicted activities have been observed is a challenging problem, with important applications that require anticipatory response. In this work, we propose a system that can infer the labels and the captions of a sequence of future activities. Our proposed network for label prediction of a future activity sequence has three branches where the first branch takes visual features from the objects present in the scene, the second branch takes observed sequential activity features, and the third branch captures the last observed activity features. The predicted labels and the observed scene context are then mapped to meaningful captions using a sequence-to-sequence learning-based method.

To address this issue, a novel one-step backtracking (OB) tracker for occlusion detection is proposed, which backtracks to one previous frame and detects occlusion by comparing the tracking result with OB result in each frame. An adaptive learning model update scheme is further proposed by computing the peak-to-sidelobe ratio of the response maps to improve the tracking performance.

Afforestation is an effective strategy to restore degraded land. Glomalin-related soil proteins (GRSP) and amino sugars are regarded as stable microbial-derived C, and their distribution within soil aggregates affects soil structure stability and SOC sequestration. However, the information about how afforestation affects the microbial contribution to SOC pools within aggregates is poorly understood. We assessed the accumulation and contribution of GRSP and amino sugars within soil aggregates along a restoration chronosequence (Bare land, Eucalyptus exserta plantation, native species mixed forest, and native forest) in tropical coastal terraces. Amino sugars and GRSP concentrations increased, whereas their contributions to the SOC pool decreased along the restoration chronosequence. Although microaggregates harbored greater microbial abundances, amino sugars and GRSP concentrations were not significantly affected by aggregate sizes. Interestingly, the contributions of amino sugars and GRSP to SOC pools decreased with decreasing aggregate size which might be associated with increased accumulation of plant-derived C. However, the relative change rate of GRSP was consistently greater in all restoration chronosequences than that of amino sugars. The accumulation of GRSP and amino sugars in SOC pools was closely associated with the dynamics of soil fertility and the microbial community. Our findings suggest that GRSP accumulates faster and contributes more to SOC pools during restoration than amino sugars did which was greatly affected by aggregate sizes. Afforestation substantially enhanced soil quality with native forest comprising species sequestering more SOC than the monoculture plantation did. Such information is invaluable for improving our mechanistic understanding of microbial control over SOC preservation during degraded ecosystem restoration. Our findings also show that plantations using arbuscular mycorrhizal plants can be an effective practice to sequester more soil carbon during restoration.",afforestation; amino sugars; glomalin-related soil protein; soil aggregates; soil microbial community; tropical coastal terrace.

2091,A Gradient Intensity-Adapted Algorithm With Adaptive Selection Strategy for the Fast Decision of H.264/AVC Intra-Prediction Modes,"Kau, Lih-Jen; Leng, Jia-Wei","H.264/Advanced Video Coding (AVC) is well known for its superiority of finding an optimal tradeoff between the visual quality and the bit-rate expense. Nevertheless, the highly complex procedures of finding an optimal intra-or interprediction mode can degrade the run-time performance of the coding process. To speed up the run-time performance during the encoding of H.264/AVC intra-prediction mode, we apply in this paper a simple yet effective gradient evaluation approach so that the texture orientation inside the coding block can be evaluated efficiently. Moreover, we propose an adaptive selection strategy in this paper so that only a subset with a variable number of the intra-prediction modes will be sent for the rate-distortion optimization process. With the proposed gradient evaluation and adaptive selection strategy, a noticeable speedup on the run-time performance can be achieved with only a minor degradation on the visual quality and the bit-rate expense. When compared with the existing state-of-the-art fast decision algorithms, a significant improvement over prior arts on the proposed cost performance metric can be obtained, which demonstrates the superiority of the proposed approach.",Adaptive selection strategy; cost performance index (CP-index); edge detection; fast mode decision; H. 264/Advanced Video Coding (AVC); intra prediction
2092,Coverage path planning with targetted viewpoint sampling for robotic free-form surface inspection,"Glorieux, Emile; Franciosa, Pasquale; Ceglarek, Dariusz","Surface metrology systems are increasingly used for inspecting dimensional quality in manufacturing. The gauge of these measurement systems is often mounted as an end-effector on robotic systems to exploit the robots' high degrees of freedom to reposition the gauge to different viewpoints. With this repositioning flexibility, a planning methodology becomes necessary in order to carefully plan the viewpoints, as well as the optimal sequence and quickest path to move the gauge to each viewpoint. This paper investigates coverage path planning for robotic single-sided dimensional inspection of free-form surfaces. Reviewing existing feasible state-of-the-art methodologies to solve this problem led to identifying an unexplored opportunity to improve the coverage path planning, specifically by replacing random viewpoint sampling strategy. This study reveals that a non-random targetted viewpoint sampling strategy significantly contributes to solution quality of the resulting planned coverage path. By deploying optimisation during the viewpoint sampling, an optimal set of admissible viewpoints can be obtained, which consequently significantly shortens the cycle-time for the inspection task. Results that evaluate the proposed viewpoint sampling strategy for two industrial sheet metal parts, as well as a comparison with the state-of-the-art are presented. The results show up to 23.8% reduction in cycle-time for the inspection task when using targetted viewpoints sampling.",3D surface inspection; Robot motion planning; Free-form surface; Dimensional metrology

The study provides mechanistic insights into how GA repositioning (GR) is regulated, and how GR and centrosome repositioning (CR) are coupled. Our previous published works reveals that PRMT5 methylates HURP at R122 and the HURP m122 inhibits GR and cell migration by stabilizing GA-associated acetyl-tubulin and then rigidifying GA. The current study further shows that the demethylase JMJD6-guided demethylation of HURP at R122 promotes GR and cell migration. The HURP methylation mimicking mutant 122 F blocks JMJD6-induced GR and cell migration, suggesting JMJD6 relays GR stimulating signal to HURP. Mechanistic studies reveal that the HURP methylation deficiency mutant 122 K promotes GR through NF-κB-induced CR and subsequently CR-dependent Cdc42 upregulation, where Cdc42 couples CR to GR. Taken together, HURP methylation statuses provide a unique opportunity to understand how GR is regulated, and the GA intrinsic mechanism controlling Golgi rigidity and the GA extrinsic mechanism involving NF-κB-CR-Cdc42 cascade collectively dictate GR.",Golgi repositioning; HURP; JMJD6; cell migration; centrosome repositioning.

The present study aimed to explore the potential pro-osteogenic differentiation effect of galangin, a flavonoid derived from Alpinia officinarum, on human amniotic mesenchymal stem cells (hAMSCs) and the underlying molecular mechanism. The results showed that galangin had no cytotoxicity towards hAMSCs when the concentration was less than 50 μM. Treatment with 10 μM galangin significantly increased alkaline phosphatase (ALP) secretion and calcium deposition in hAMSCs. Meanwhile, galangin upregulated the mRNA and protein expression of early osteoblast-specific markers, namely ALP, RUNX2, and OSX, and late osteoblast-specific markers, CoL1α1, OPN, and OCN, in hAMSCs. Furthermore, signaling pathway screening studies showed that galangin enhanced the phosphorylation of Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3). In addition, molecular docking results suggest there is a promising interaction between galangin and JAK2. Finally, treatment with the JAK2 specific inhibitor AG490 effectively reversed the induction of osteogenic differentiation, upregulation of osteoblast-specific marker expression, and activation of JAK2/STAT3 signaling induced by galangin. These results show that galangin induces the osteogenic differentiation of hAMSCs through the JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway and could serve as a promising small molecular osteoinducer for application to hAMSCs in regenerative medicine.",Differentiation; Galangin; Human amniotic mesenchymal stem cell; JAK2/STAT3 signaling; Osteoblast.

Here, a novel homologue of IκB was cloned from Crassostrea gigas, and designated as CgIκB3. The complete CgIκB3 cDNA was 1282 bp in length, including a 942 bp open reading frame (ORF), a 51 bp 5' UTR and a 289 bp 3' UTR. The ORF encodes a putative protein of 313 amino acids with a predicted molecular weight of approximately 34.7 kDa. Sequence analysis reveals that CgIκB3 contains a conserved degradation motif but with only five ankyrin repeats. Neither a PEST domain nor a C-terminal casein kinase II phosphorylation site was identified through either alignment or bioinformatic prediction. Phylogenetic analysis suggested that CgIκB3 shares common ancestor with CgIκB1 rather CgIκB2, and theoretically it may originate from one duplication event prior to divergence of CgIκB1 and CgIκB2. Tissue expression analyses demonstrated that CgIκB3 mRNA is the most abundant in gills and heart. The expression following PAMP infection showed that CgIκB3 was significantly up-regulated in a similar pattern when challenged with LPS, HKLM or HKVA, respectively. Moreover, similar to CgIκB1 and CgIκB2, CgIκB3 can also inhibit Rel dependent NF-κB activation in HEK293 cells in a dose-dependent manner. In summary, these findings suggest that CgIκB3 can be as the functional inhibitor of NF-κB/Rel and involved in the host defense of C. gigas. The discovery of the third IκB emphasizes the complexity and importance of the regulation on NF-κB activation.",CgIκB3; Crassostrea gigas; Gene duplication; Immune defense; Rel/NF-κB.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of several methods of postoperative immobilization and to determine which postoperative immobilization technique has the fewest complications. Materials and methods A retrospective cohort study of pediatric patients with cerebral palsy who underwent hip reconstructive procedures, in which a hip spica cast, Petrie cast, or abduction pillow was placed for postoperative hip immobilization, was conducted. Patients who underwent revision surgery and those without cerebral palsy were excluded from the analysis. The final cohort consisted of 70 cases. Demographics, laterality of surgery, procedure type, hip immobilization technique, and 30-day postoperative complications were recorded. Complications were defined as those related to casting immobilization, such as re-dislocation or loss of surgical fixation, and soft tissue complications, such as pressure ulcers or any superficial or deep wound infection. Results Of the 70 patients, 27 received spica casting, 28 received Petrie casting, and 15 received an abduction pillow. The complication rates, as defined in the methods section, were 14.8% for the spica cast group, 17.9% for Petrie cast, and 26.7% for abduction pillow. There was no significant difference in complication rates among spica cast, Petrie cast, or abduction pillow groups (P=0.76). Conclusions There was no significant difference in length of stay, pain control duration, or complication rates among the three methods of immobilization.

Specifically, the energies of EEG signals located in multiple local SFT ranges are extracted to obtain a novel 3D MI EEG feature representation, and a novel 3D CNN model is designed to simultaneously learn the complex MI EEG features in the entire SFT domains and carry out classification. An extensive experimental study is implemented on two public EEG datasets to evaluate the effectiveness of our method. For BCI Competition III Dataset IVa, the average accuracy rate of five subjects obtained by the proposed method reaches 86.6% and yields 4.1% improvement over the state-of-the-art filter band common spatial pattern (FBCSP) method. For BCI Competition III dataset IIIa, by achieving an average accuracy rate of 91.85%, the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art dictionary pair learning (DPL) method by 4.44%.",Brain&#8211; computer interface (BCI); Electroencephalogram (EEG); 3D convolutional neural network (3D CNN); Spatial frequency temporal (SFT)

In current medical practice, multimodality imaging is routinely used in the management of AF. Twenty-one years ago, the ACUTE trial (Assessment of Cardioversion Using Transesophageal Echocardiography) results were published, and the management of AF changed forever by incorporating transesophageal echocardiography guided cardioversion of patients in AF for the first time. Current applications of multimodality imaging in AF in 2022 include the use of transesophageal echocardiography and computed tomography before cardioversion to exclude left atrial thrombus and in left atrial appendage occlusion device implantation. Transesophageal echocardiography, cardiac computed tomography, and cardiac magnetic resonance are clinically used for AF ablation planning. The decision to use a particular imaging modality in AF is based on patient's characteristics, guideline recommendation, institutional preferences, expertise, and cost. In this first of 2-part review series, we discuss the preprocedural role of echocardiography, computed tomography, and cardiac magnetic resonance in the AF, with regard to their clinical applications, relevant outcomes data and unmet needs, and highlights future directions in this rapidly evolving field.","atrial fibrillation; echocardiography, transesophageal; heart failure; magnetic resonance; magnetic resonance imaging; multidetector computed tomography; tomography."

The marine culture brought by marine landscapes affects the development and dissemination of culture and art in coastal cities and is an important source for the unique regional cultural landscapes of coastal cities. Based on the development of regional marine culture, this study aims to explore the role of marine landscapes in the cultural and artistic design of coastal cities and proposes corresponding strategies for cultural construction and development. The research results show that a beautiful marine landscape can be created in each coastal city; the basic elements of marine landscape design include conceptual elements, humanistic elements, natural elements, and artificial environment elements. The cultural and artistic design process in coastal cities must not only meet the requirements of urban development strategy, resource allocation, industrial layout, spatial pattern, and city image, but also adapt to the marine cultural atmosphere.

The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated these barriers by potentially forcing physicians to modify their treatment plans due to limitations on in-person visits and changes to patients' financial and social support systems. It remains uncertain whether physicians believe they can provide the same standard of care using telehealth technology or other means to their patients during the pandemic. The goal of this study was to explore physician perceptions about their ability to provide care to patients with T2DM during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methodology This cross-sectional study collected data between January 25, 2021, and February 2, 2021, using an anonymous, self-administered online survey involving DO and MD physicians including residents treating patients with T2DM. The survey was administered via REDCap and collected data on participant demographics, attitudes, perceptions, knowledge, and prior and current (COVID-19-era) experience with care for T2DM patients. Physicians registered with the Florida Department of Health with publicly available emails were invited to participate. Results The survey showed that during the COVID-19 pandemic, 57.9% of physicians (n=48) believed that their patients have a weaker social support system; 68.7% (n=57) modified their patient care plans due to patients' financial difficulties; 78.4% (n=65) believed a regular physical exam is necessary to properly treat patients; 48.2% (n=40) did not believe they had a more complete picture of the case with remote consultations; 47.0% (n=39) were not as satisfied with remote consultations as with face-to-face patient visits; 68.7% (n=57) believed telehealth is necessary to adequately treat patients; 38.5% (n=32) have been less likely to refer their patients to other providers or specialists; 45.8% (n=38) reported concerns over admitting their patients to the hospital for acute medical care; 61.5% (n=51) reported having more patients delay scheduling their routine follow-up care; 61.5% (n=51) believed their patients have been less compliant with the healthcare plans recommended to them. Conclusions The study showed that COVID-19 has significantly impacted physicians' perceptions and abilities to provide care for patients with T2DM. COVID-19 has negatively impacted several crucial aspects of diabetes management, including consistent in-person examinations, social support, and referral to other required services, which could result in long-term consequences for these patients. Furthermore, our study suggests that physicians may not be as satisfied with the care they are able to provide via remote consultations as they are with in-person visits, which has significant implications as we move toward a more telehealth-driven healthcare delivery system.",covid 19 impact of lockdown; diabetes type 2; drug compliance; physician satisfaction; telehealth appointments.
2105,Radial Bias Alters Perceived Object Orientation,"Melisa Menceloglu,Ken Nakayama,Joo-Hyun Song,Melisa Menceloglu,Ken Nakayama,Joo-Hyun Song","Orientation sensitivity is a fundamental property of the visual system, but not all orientations are created equal. For instance, radially oriented stimuli, aligned with a line intersecting the center of gaze, produce greater activity throughout the visual cortex and are associated with greater perceptual sensitivity compared with other orientations. Here, we discuss a robust visual illusion that is likely related to this preference. Using a continuous response measure, participants (N = 36 adults) indicated the gap position in a peripheral Landolt C placed in one of eight orientations and eight locations along four meridians (vertical, horizontal, 45°, 135°). The error distributions revealed that the perceived gap was attracted toward the radial axis. For instance, the gap in a regular C would often be wrongly perceived as tilted 45° corresponding to the oblique meridian where it was placed. These findings demonstrate an unsuspected early-vision influence on the perceived orientation of an object.",orientation sensitivity; radial bias; visual perception.

Acute exposures revealed a greater 96-h median lethal concentration (LC50) for C. punctata (14.67 mg/l) compared to C. idella (7.98 mg/l). During their chronic exposure, both fishes' hemoglobin content (Hb), red blood cells (RBC), and hematocrit (HCT) markedly decreased (p < 0.05), although their clotting time (CT) significantly increased. At 96 h, immune-modulation was observed where total protein and serum globulin levels in both fishes considerably decreased (p < 0.05) compared to the first exposure at 0 days, although total glucose, triglyceride, cholesterol, and albumin levels in both fishes significantly increased (p < 0.05) at 30 days. The lower cholesterol levels in C. punctata compared to C. idella are suggestive of a disrupted cholesterol transformation pathway. The greater total protein, triglyceride, albumin, and globulin levels in C. punctata compared to C. idella are suggestive of a comparatively robust immune capacity. In essence, selenium toxicity in the wild could manifest as disrupted metabolic pathways and downregulated immune capacity for less hardy species. In general, both fish species displayed significant alterations in their hematological and biochemical responses with increased exposure duration and elevated toxicant concentrations. This comparative investigation could improve the knowledge-spectrum of selenium toxicity in the wild as well as an understanding of secondary stress responses critically evident in hematological and biochemical parameters.",Channa punctata; Cholesterol transformation; Ctenopharyngodon idella; Immunological modulation; Selenate.
2107,A Fast Omega-K Algorithm for Near-Field 3-D Imaging of MIMO Synthetic Aperture Radar Data,"Tan, Kai","Multiple-input-multiple-output synthetic aperture radar (MIMO-SAR) is being studied and used in more and more sensing applications. However, to deal with large-size scanning data without acceleration technology, there is still a certain distance away from real-time operation using the previous state-of-the-art imaging algorithms, which must use complicated interpolation or iteration operations. To conquer this difficulty, a fast imaging algorithm is developed for 3-D near-range imaging on MINIO-SAR. An appropriate expansion is carried out to the coupling phase term, and thus the differential correction for the MIMO data set can be realized with only a range inverse fast Fourier transform (IFFT) and a matched filtering, which are easy to implement. The computational complexity of the algorithm is O(N-4 log(2) N), which is lower than the previous state-of-the-art algorithms. Short-range measurements on a millimeter-waveband MIMO-SAR with different distributed targets demonstrate the performance of the proposed algorithm. Real-time operation is achieved using the algorithm even with a regular CPU.",3-D near-range imaging; multiple-input-multiple-output synthetic aperture radar (MIMO-.SAR); omega-K algorithm; real-time imaging

However, often the modeling procedures do not include proper validation but rather rely only on either external test dataset or one-level cross-validation. ATSC-NEX is an automated procedure that employs sequential model-based optimization together with nested cross-validation to build an accurate and properly validated time series classification model. It aims to find an optimal pipeline configuration that includes the selection of input type and settings, as well as model type and hyperparameters. The results of a case study in which a model for the identification of diesel engine type is developed, show that the algorithm can efficiently find a well-performing pipeline configuration. The comparison between ATSC-NEX and some state-of-the-art methods on several benchmark datasets shows that similar accuracy can be achieved.",Time series analysis; Optimization; Data models; Computational modeling; Feature extraction; Benchmark testing; Transforms; Tme series classification; automated machine learning; configuration optimization; sequential model-based optimization; nested cross-validation
2109,Spatio-Temporal Representation Matching-Based Open-Set Action Recognition by Joint Learning of Motion and Appearance,"Yoon, Yongsang; Yu, Jongmin; Jeon, Moongu","In this paper, we propose the spatio-temporal representation matching (STRM) for video-based action recognition under the open-set condition. Open-set action recognition is a more challenging problem than closed-set action recognition since samples of the untrained action class need to be recognized and most of the conventional frameworks are likely to give a false prediction. To handle the untrained action classes, we propose STRM, which involves jointly learning both motion and appearance. STRM extracts spatio-temporal representations from video clips through a joint learning pipeline with both motion and appearance information. Then, STRM computes the similarities between the ST-representations to find the one with highest similarity. We set the experimental protocol for open-set action recognition and carried out experiments on UCF101 and HMDB51 to evaluate STRM. We first investigated the effects of different hyper-parameter settings on STRM, and then compared its performance with existing state-of-the-art methods. The experimental results showed that the proposed method not only outperformed existing methods under the open-set condition, but also provided comparable performance to the state-of-the-art methods under the closed-set condition.",Action recognition; open-set recognition; spatio-temporal representation; joint learning of motion and appearance
2110,Automated Superpixel-borders-guided Deformation Image Registration for Adaptive Radiotherapy,"Zhang, Li; Li, Bin; Tian, Lian-Fang; Li, Xiang-Xia; Zhang, Ming-Sheng; Liu, Shuang-Chun","Registration between the baseline and follow-up lung computed tomography (CT) volumes plays an important role in computer-aided diagnosis and following-up care during adaptive radiotherapy. Diffeomorphic log-Demons as state of the art in Demons implementations is restricted to relatively small deformations, low accuracy, and ignoring some prior structural features. In this paper, an automated superpixel-borders-guided deformation image registration (SBG-DIR) algorithm is proposed. The proposed SBG-DIR method uses the simple linear iterative clustering (SLIC) algorithm to automated superpixels generation. Incorporation of superpixel borders into registration algorithm is implemented by a new similarity criterion based on the binary volume representation of superpixel borders. The binary volume representation enables accurate preserving motion boundaries, contributes to a faster convergence of the objective function and eliminates errors caused by manual interaction. In addition, a subtraction volume is produced by the intensity difference between the first time point CT volume and its warped follow-up CT volume. The subtraction volume can be used for detection of tumor tissue growth or shrinkage, which is an essential part of a CT-based diagnosis. Moreover, to ensure the topology preservation of biological objects, our proposed SBG-DIR method is implemented in the space of diffeomorphisms, in which meaningful biological shapes can be found. Compared with the state-of-the-art Demons, the proposed SBG-DIR method doesn't require any additional optimization, yields a faster convergence and is more accurate and efficient in recovering large deformations. Experimental results indicate that the proposed SBG-DIR method performed better than the state-of-the-art Demons algorithms.",Adaptive radiotherapy; Computed tomography; Deformation image registration; Log-Demons; Subtraction volume; Superpixels
2111,Enabling a Single Deep Learning Model for Accurate Gland Instance Segmentation: A Shape-Aware Adversarial Learning Framework,"Yan, Zengqiang; Yang, Xin; Cheng, Kwang-Ting","Segmenting gland instances in histology images is highly challenging as it requires not only detecting glands from a complex background but also separating each individual gland instance with accurate boundary detection. However, due to the boundary uncertainty problem in manual annotations, pixel-to-pixel matching based loss functions are too restrictive for simultaneous gland detection and boundary detection. State-of-the-art approaches adopted multi-model schemes, resulting in unnecessarily high model complexity and difficulties in the training process. In this paper, we propose to use one single deep learning model for accurate gland instance segmentation. To address the boundary uncertainty problem, instead of pixel-to-pixel matching, we propose a segment-level shape similarity measure to calculate the curve similarity between each annotated boundary segment and the corresponding detected boundary segment within a fixed searching range. As the segment-level measure allows location variations within a fixed range for shape similarity calculation, it has better tolerance to boundary uncertainty and is more effective for boundary detection. Furthermore, by adjusting the radius of the searching range, the segment-level shape similarity measure is able to deal with different levels of boundary uncertainty. Therefore, in our framework, images of different scales are down-sampled and integrated to provide both global and local contextual information for training, which is helpful in segmenting gland instances of different sizes. To reduce the variations of multi-scale training images, by referring to adversarial domain adaptation, we propose a pseudo domain adaptation framework for feature alignment. By constructing loss functions based on the segment-level shape similarity measure, combining with the adversarial loss function, the proposed shape-aware adversarial learning framework enables one single deep learning model for gland instance segmentation. Experimental results on the 2015 MICCAI Gland Challenge dataset demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves state-of-the-art performance with one single deep learning model. As the boundary uncertainty problem widely exists in medical image segmentation, it is broadly applicable to other applications.",Gland instance segmentation; segment-level shape similarity measure; adversarial learning; feature alignment

D.; Daubechies, Ingrid","In support of art investigation, we propose a new source separation method that unmixes a single X-ray scan acquired from double-sided paintings. In this problem, the X-ray signals to be separated have similar morphological characteristics, which brings previous source separation methods to their limits. Our solution is to use photographs taken from the front-and back-side of the panel to drive the separation process. The crux of our approach relies on the coupling of the two imaging modalities (photographs and X-rays) using a novel coupled dictionary learning framework able to capture both common and disparate features across the modalities using parsimonious representations; the common component captures features shared by the multi-modal images, whereas the innovation component captures modality-specific information. As such, our model enables the formulation of appropriately regularized convex optimization procedures that lead to the accurate separation of the X-rays. Our dictionary learning framework can be tailored both to a single-and a multi-scale framework, with the latter leading to a significant performance improvement. Moreover, to improve further on the visual quality of the separated images, we propose to train coupled dictionaries that ignore certain parts of the painting corresponding to craquelure. Experimentation on synthetic and real data-taken from digital acquisition of the Ghent Altarpiece (1432)-confirms the superiority of our method against the state-of-the-art morphological component analysis technique that uses either fixed or trained dictionaries to perform image separation.",Source separation; coupled dictionary learning; multi-scale image decomposition; multi-modal data analysis
2113,NRF2 in dermo-cosmetic: From scientific knowledge to skin care products,"Marie-Céline Frantz,Roger Rozot,Laurent Marrot,Marie-Céline Frantz,Roger Rozot,Laurent Marrot","The skin is the organ that is most susceptible to the impact of the exposome. Located at the interface with the external environment, it protects internal organs through the barrier function of the epidermis. It must adapt to the consequences of the harmful effects of solar radiation, the various chemical constituents of atmospheric pollution, and wounds associated with mechanical damage: oxidation, cytotoxicity, inflammation, and so forth. In this biological context, a capacity to adapt to the various stresses caused by the exposome is essential; otherwise, more or less serious conditions may develop accelerated aging, pigmentation disorders, atopy, psoriasis, and skin cancers. Nrf2-controlled pathways play a key role at this level. Nrf2 is a transcription factor that controls genes involved in oxidative stress protection and detoxification of chemicals. Its involvement in UV protection, reduction of inflammation in processes associated with healing, epidermal differentiation for barrier function, and hair regrowth, has been demonstrated. The modulation of Nrf2 in the skin may therefore constitute a skin protection or care strategy for certain dermatological stresses and disorders initiated or aggravated by the exposome. Nrf2 inducers can act through different modes of action. Keap1-dependent mechanisms include modification of the cysteine residues of Keap1 by (pro)electrophiles or prooxidants, and disruption of the Keap1-Nrf2 complex. Indirect mechanisms are suggested for numerous phytochemicals, acting on upstream pathways, or via hormesis. While developing novel and safe Nrf2 modulators for skin care may be challenging, new avenues can arise from natural compounds-based molecular modeling and emerging concepts such as epigenetic regulation.",Nrf2 skin protection; dermo-cosmetology; pharmacophore modeling; phytochemicals; protein-protein interaction modulators.

Many approaches have recently been proposed for automatic glaucoma detection based on fundus images. However, none of the existing approaches can efficiently remove high redundancy in fundus images for glaucoma detection, which may reduce the reliability and accuracy of glaucoma detection. To avoid this disadvantage, this paper proposes an attention-based convolutional neural network (CNN) for glaucoma detection, called AG-CNN. Specifically, we first establish a large-scale attention-based glaucoma (LAG) database, which includes 11 760 fundus images labeled as either positive glaucoma (4878) or negative glaucoma (6882). Among the 11 760 fundus images, the attention maps of 5824 images are further obtained from ophthalmologists through a simulated eye-tracking experiment. Then, a new structure of AG-CNN is designed, including an attention prediction subnet, a pathological area localization subnet, and a glaucoma classification subnet. The attention maps are predicted in the attention prediction subnet to highlight the salient regions for glaucoma detection, under a weakly supervised training manner. In contrast to other attention-based CNN methods, the features are also visualized as the localized pathological area, which are further added in our AG-CNN structure to enhance the glaucoma detection performance. Finally, the experiment results from testing over our LAG database and another public glaucoma database show that the proposed AG-CNN approach significantly advances the state-of-the-art in glaucoma detection.",Glaucoma detection; attention mechanism; pathological area detection; weakly supervised

It is still controversial what factors influence carbon information disclosure quality in China's power industry. This paper involved four factors: government regulation, media reports, enterprise size, and directors' professional backgrounds based on strategic change theory. The carbon information disclosure quality was measured using the analytic hierarchy process (APH) and entropy weight method (EWM). Then, panel data regression was used to analyze the relationship between the factors and carbon information disclosure quality. The results showed that (1) the quantity of media reports has no significant correlation with carbon information disclosure quality. (2) The proportion of directors with legal backgrounds to all directors is significantly and negatively correlated with carbon information disclosure quality. (3) Government regulation, the media value orientation, enterprise size, and the proportion of directors with accounting backgrounds to all directors are significantly and positively related to the carbon information disclosure quality.",Carbon information disclosure quality; Influencing factors; Power industry.

The proposed mechanism is a regurgitant jet propelling blood towards the orifice of a particular pulmonary vein within the left atrium, which selectively pressurizes that vein. The increased hydrostatic pressure is transmitted to the pulmonary capillaries that drain into that vein, causing focal consolidation. A 62-year-old female presented with acute hypoxic respiratory failure. Her dyspnea started suddenly and she was unresponsive when she arrived at the emergency department via emergency medical services. Her initial oxygen saturation was 23% and she was immediately intubated. Sequential chest radiographs demonstrated dense consolidation in the right upper lung field and then opacification of the right hemithorax. These asymmetric lung findings were suspicious for infectious etiology but she was afebrile with no respiratory secretions and had normal inflammatory markers. Echocardiography showed a ruptured anterior papillary muscle causing a flail mitral valve leaflet with severe mitral regurgitation. The patient developed cardiogenic shock; she had an intra-aortic balloon pump placed for afterload reduction and was taken to the operating room for an emergency mitral valve replacement. Her clinical status rapidly improved and she made a full recovery. As in this case, acute mitral regurgitation can present with sudden life-threatening respiratory failure and cardiogenic shock so prompt diagnosis is critical. This is often misdiagnosed as pneumonia or other respiratory illnesses.

Therefore, by conducting an experiment on its materialization and proposing a snew plan for its improvement, we connect the features and concepts of IoT to the above field by analyzing existing public-relations videos based on related theoretical studies.

2124,Feature Point Extraction and Tracking Based on a Local Adaptive Threshold,"Li, Hang; Yang, Hongfan; Chen, Kaiyang","Navigation, environment perception and localization are important capabilities of intelligent vehicles. In this paper, environmental perception and localization from binocular vision are studied. First, an outdoor feature point extraction algorithm that uses a local adaptive threshold is proposed to acquire environmental information. The algorithm filters feature points by setting adaptive parameters and calculating each pixel threshold with a dynamic local threshold. Second, an accurate method for feature point tracking is proposed for localization. We present exhaustive evaluation in 4 major scenarios from the most popular datasets. Evaluating the proposed method with traditional and state-of-the-art extraction methods and experimental results demonstrates that when the brightness decreases or increases, the performance of the proposed method is stable in terms of the number of feature points, the calculation speed and the overall repetition rate. Our proposed tracking method outperforms state-of-the-art tracking methods in terms of the root mean square error (RMSE) and the errors in the dimensions in the scenarios.",Feature extraction; Navigation; Visualization; Detectors; Heuristic algorithms; Brightness; Intelligent vehicles; Feature extraction; tracking; oriented FAST and rotated BRIEF(ORB); features from accelerated segment test (FAST); root mean squared error (RMSE)
2125,Kernel Bundle Diffeomorphic Image Registration Using Stationary Velocity Fields and Wendland Basis Functions,"Pai, Akshay; Sommer, Stefan; Sorensen, Lauge; Darkner, Sune; Sporring, Jon; Nielsen, Mads","In this paper, we propose a multi-scale, multi-kernel shape, compactly supported kernel bundle framework for stationary velocity field-based image registration (Wendland kernel bundle stationary velocity field, wKB-SVF). We exploit the possibility of directly choosing kernels to construct a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) instead of imposing it from a differential operator. The proposed framework allows us to minimize computational cost without sacrificing the theoretical foundations of SVF-based diffeomorphic registration. In order to recover deformations occurring at different scales, we use compactly supported Wendland kernels at multiple scales and orders to parameterize the velocity fields, and the framework allows simultaneous optimization over all scales. The performance of wKB-SVF is extensively compared to the 14 non-rigid registration algorithms presented in a recent comparison paper. On both MGH10 and CUMC12 datasets, the accuracy of wKB-SVF is improved when compared to other registration algorithms. In a disease-specific application for intra-subject registration, atrophy scores estimated using the proposed registration scheme separates the diagnostic groups of Alzheimer's and normal controls better than the state-of-the-art segmentation technique. Experimental results show that wKB-SVF is a robust, flexible registration framework that allows theoretically well-founded and computationally efficient multi-scale representation of deformations and is equally well-suited for both inter-and intra-subject image registration.",Kernel bundle framework; registration; reproducing kernel hilbert spaces; wendland kernels
2126,Fuzzy rule based unsupervised sentiment analysis from social media posts,"Vashishtha, Srishti; Susan, Seba","In this paper, we compute the sentiment of social media posts using a novel set of fuzzy rules involving multiple lexicons and datasets. The proposed fuzzy system integrates Natural Language Processing techniques and Word Sense Disambiguation using a novel unsupervised nine fuzzy rule based system to classify the post into: positive, negative or neutral sentiment class. We perform a comparative analysis of our method on nine public twitter datasets, three sentiment lexicons, four state-of-the-art approaches for unsupervised Sentiment Analysis and one state-of-the-art method for supervised machine learning. Traditionally, Sentiment Analysis of twitter data is performed using a single lexicon. Our results can give an insight to researchers to choose which lexicon is best for social media. The fusion of fuzzy logic with lexicons for sentiment classification provides a new paradigm in Sentiment Analysis. Our method can be adapted to any lexicon and any dataset (two-class or three-class sentiment). The experiments on benchmark datasets yield higher performance for our approach as compared to the state-of-the-art. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

2127,The Abstract Expressionists and Les Automatistes: A shared multi-fractal depth?,"Mureika, J. R.; Taylor, R. P.","Statistical analysis of abstract paintings is becoming an increasingly important tool for understanding the creative process of visual artists. We present a multifractal analysis of 'poured' paintings from the Abstract Expressionism and Les Automatistes movements. The box-counting dimension (D-o) is measured for the analyzed paintings, as is the associated multifractal depth Delta D=D-o - D-infinity, where D-infinity, is the asymptotic dimension. We investigate the role of depth by plotting a 'phase space' diagram that examines the relationship between D-o and D-infinity. We show that, although the D-o and D-infinity values vary between individual paintings, the collection of paintings exhibit a similar depth, suggesting a shared visual characteristic for this genre. We discuss the visual implications of this result. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",Multifractal; Art
2128,Evolution and diagnostic utility of aeolian rat-tails: A new type of abrasion feature on Earth and Mars,"Favaro, Elena A.; Hugenholtz, Christopher H.; Barchyn, Thomas E.","Aeolian rat-tails (ARTs) are a previously undocumented, regionally-ubiquitous aeolian abrasion feature observed on matrix-supported ignimbrite surfaces in the Puna Plateau of Northwest Argentina. ARTs consist of an abrasion -resistant lithic clast projecting above the surface with a lee tail or 'keel' in the more erodible matrix. Size is controlled by the dimensions of the windward lithic clast, ranging from centimetre to meter scale; spatial density varies with clast content, which may reflect variations in ignimbrite facies. Field observations suggest ARTs follow a definable evolutionary sequence. First, an abrasion-resistant lithic clast contained within the ignimbrite is exposed to abrasion at the surface. Impacts from abrading particles erode the softer ignimbrite matrix adjacent to the clast. The clast shelters the leeward surface under a unimodal abrasion direction, creating a tail that tapers downwind and elongates as the clast emerges. Clasts become dislodged from the matrix as the surrounding surface erodes, ultimately destroying the feature if the clast is small enough to be mobilized directly by wind or impacting particles. This evolutionary sequence explains the morphology of ARTs and the presence of loose clasts on the ignimbrite surface, which contributes to the development of other landforms in the region, such as periodic bedrock ridges, yardangs, and megaripples. Satellite and rover images suggest similar features also exist on Mars. Because the formation and preservation of ARTs is contingent on unimodal abrasion direction, their orientation can be used as an indicator of long-term aeolian sediment transport direction.",Aeolian rat-tail; Abrasion; Landform; Wind direction; Ignimbrite; Argentina
2129,"Prehistoric landmarks in contrasted territories: Rock art of the Libyan Desert massifs, Egypt","Honore, Emmanuelle","In the Libyan Desert, the Gilf el-Kebir and Jebel el-'Uweinat are two large rock formations located in the extreme South-West of Egypt, at the edge of the Libyan and Sudanese borders. A hundred and twenty kilometers from each other, they are surrounded by plains and sandy formations, punctuated by a few smaller massifs. Although they are of different ages and geological formations, the two great massifs both offered interesting and complementary refuges for prehistoric groups who used rock shelters, cliffs and boulders for engraving and painting. The existence of a multitude of styles and techniques allow to detect striking parallels between the rock art record of the two regions, providing a dynamic view of the regionalization of rock art and of how these territories were conceived and occupied by semi-nomadic groups during the Holocene optimum period (8000-3500 BCE). Paintings from the Gilf el-Kebir show very close stylistic affinities with representations identified in the Jebel el-'Uweinat. But the fact that they remain a minority in the overall rock art record from both areas tends to evidence that, contrary to what has been hypothesized before, migrations between the Gilf el-Kebir and the Jebel el-'Uweinat were not systematic. This paper also highlights a possible increase in the contacts and migrations between the two massifs after the adoption of pastoralist lifestyles. The repartition of rock art and the evolution through times of the parallels offers interesting insights into land use strategies of both hunter-gatherers and herd keepers in such contrasted environments, and into what can be called symbolic territories.

We investigated the characteristics and abundance of MPs in water, sediment and biological tissues from samples collected in the vicinity of ten dams in the Shaying River basin and analyzed the effect of environmental and food web structural changes on MP accumulation in freshwater animals under the influence of dams. Dam construction affects the transportation, suspension, and deposition of MPs at different dam locations (upstream, reservoir, and downstream) by altering hydrodynamihas changed the migration process of MPs. The dams intercepted a large amount of MPs from upstream sediments in the reservoir but had no significant capturing effect on MPs in water. The structure of the food web in the reservoir was simplified and the animals in the reservoir had the highest risk of MP contamination. A high MP abundance (or high microplastic diversity integrated index (MDII) values) in the environment or simplification of the food web may have led to higher MP accumulation in animals. More effort is needed to monitor MP pollution in reservoirs and control it sources.",Bioaccumulation; Dam; Food web; Freshwater animals; Microplastics.
2131,Treatment of copper nanoparticles (CuNPs) for two spermatogenic cycles impairs testicular activity via down-regulating steroid receptors and inhibition of germ cell proliferation in a mice model,"Vanrohlu Nicy,Milirani Das,Guruswami Gurusubramanian,Pradip Mondal,Vikas Kumar Roy,Vanrohlu Nicy,Milirani Das,Guruswami Gurusubramanian,Pradip Mondal,Vikas Kumar Roy","Although copper is an indispensable trace metal for biological functions, its excess exposure causes hazardous effects on health. Copper in the form of nanoparticles (CuNPs) is widely used at present and therefore, the living organism is at continuous risk of its adverse effect. The prolonged treatment of CuNPs has not been evaluated yet on the male reproductive system. To demonstrate the combined adverse effects and the mechanism of copper nanoparticles (CuNPs), three doses of CuNPs, 10, 100 and 200 mg/kg were orally given to mice for 70 days. The present study demonstrated that CuNPs decreased the sperm quality parameters, male circulating hormones, induces testicular damages, increased oxidative stress, apoptosis, decreases antioxidant enzymes, germ cell proliferation, and increases the expression of 8-oxoguanine DNA glycosylase-1 (OGG1), apelin receptor (APJ) as well. CuNPs also down-regulated the expression of AR and Erα in the testis. These results suggest that CuNPs manifested their adverse effect on testis via modulating steroid and cytokine (apelin) receptors. The adverse effect of testis was most pronounced at the highest dose (200 mg/kg) of CuNPs, however, other doses show a less toxic effect on various parameters. In conclusion, results indicated that CuNPs may impair spermatogenesis via oxidative stress-mediated DNA damage and germ cell apoptosis at high doses.",Copper nanoparticles; Mice; Spermatogenesis; Testis; apoptosis; oxidative stress; proliferation.

Then the proposed and existing VPs are mapped on the Poincaré sphere with 3D visualization, and an indicator of spatial feature is defined based on the minimum enclosing sphere to evaluate the classification capability of the VPs.

2136,Saliency Analysis and Gaussian Mixture Model-Based Detail Extraction Algorithm for Hyperspectral Pansharpening,"Dong, Wenqian; Liang, Jie; Xiao, Song","The purpose of hyperspectral (HS) pansharpening is to improve the spatial resolution of HS images using panchromatic (PAN) images so as to obtain the pansharpened images with both high spectral diversity and high spatial resolution. The classical component substitution (CS)-based pansharpening approaches can be decomposed into two sequential phases: detail extraction and detail injection. In general, the detail extraction is performed by computing the difference between the PAN image and a weighted average of the HS bands, whereas the detail injection depends on the injection gain which is defined locally or globally. In this article, we introduce a novel pansharpening algorithm in which the extracted details and the injection gain are estimated over salient and nonsalient regions achieved via saliency analysis and Gaussian mixture model. The proposed method is applied to four credible CS-based pansharpening methods and also compared to other state-of-the-art methods. Experimental results show that the modified CS methods have better performance than the original methods. In addition, our method also achieves comparable or better performance than the other state-of-the-art methods.",Detail extraction; Gaussian mixture model (GMM); pansharpening; saliency analysis

However, the molecular mechanisms that control gene activation and repression associated with the macrophage response to acute ZIKV infection are not fully understood. We approached the issue by RNA-seq and miRNA-seq datasets to understand the genetic program of ZIKV-infected macrophages. Results indicate that macrophage activates a regulatory program, involving 1067 differentially expressed genes. These genetic programs induced an inflammatory response mediated by chemokines as well as an interferon-independent anti-viral response, presumptively activated by IL-27. Additionally, the pathogenetic process involves changes in other signaling pathways such as cellular stress, cell signaling, metabolism, and cell differentiation. Furthermore, transcriptional control analysis revealed regulatory functions of key transcription factors principally, NFκB and STAT1, as well as HIF1A, ETV7, and PRMD1 that are associated with metabolic reprogramming during viral infection. We also noted six long-noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) that may act in the regulation of gene expression, including MROCKI and ZC2HC1A-2, that are involved in the inflammatory response and expression of the cytokines, respectively. On the other hand, post-transcriptional control by miRNAs, including miR-155-5p and miR-146a-5p, are associated with modulation of genes related to inflammatory and antiviral responses. Relevant to the post-transcriptional control, our data unveiled the role of RNA binding proteins that have diverse functions such as ribonucleases (PNPT1, ZC3H12A, and ZC3HAV1), splicing factors (SSB, RBM11, and RAVER2), and RNA modifiers (PARP10 and PARP14).

Precise placement of electrodes is critical for treatment success. The aim of this study was to analyze the accuracy of the intraoperative computer tomography (CT) images compared to that of a traditional fixed CT for patients undergoing DBS procedures. Methods We retrospectively analyzed the charts from 30 patients who underwent DBS. In group 1, 10 patients underwent electrode implantation surgery using a fixed CT scanner for pre- and post-operative (OP) images. In group 2, 20 patients underwent surgery using an intraoperative CT scanner for pre- and post-operative images, as well as a fixed CT scanner for post-operative images. We compared the average pre-operative localizer box registration error acquired in these two groups. We also analyzed, in group 2, the final electrode position given on each post-operative CT images. We compared the average Euclidean distances between each set of cartesian coordinates to assess target accuracy between both scanning methodologies. Results Thirty patients had ages ranging from 40 to 88 years, with a median of 69 years old. In the 20 patients who utilized an intraoperative CT scanner pre-operatively in group 2, the mean error, given by the Medtronic software (Medtronic Minimally Invasive Therapies, Minneapolis, MN) with the Leksell frame on, was 0.37. For the 10 pre-operative scans with the stealth fixed CT scanner in group 1, the mean error was 0.44 (p = 0.13). In group 2, the average of the 20 Euclidean distances for each target, in those 20 patients who had post-operative images with both scanners, was 0.36. Conclusion We concluded that the accuracy of the intraoperative CT scanner is comparable to the gold standard fixed CT scanner for DBS electrode planning and placement, as well as for positioning confirmation after the electrodes are in place.",deep brain stimulation (dbs); euclidean distance; intraoperative ct scanner; leksell localizer box; movement disorders.

Herein an HTM (EDOT-Amide-TPA) is reported in which a functional amide-based backbone is introduced, which allows this material to be synthesized in a simple condensation reaction with an estimated cost of <$5 g(-1). When employed in perovskite solar cells, EDOT-Amide-TPA demonstrates stabilized power conversion efficiencies up to 20.0% and reproducibly outperforms Spiro-OMeTAD in direct comparisons. Time resolved microwave conductivity measurements indicate that the observed improvement originates from a faster hole injection rate from the perovskite to EDOT-Amide-TPA. Additionally, the devices exhibit an improved lifetime, which is assigned to the coordination of the amide bond to the Li-additive, offering a novel strategy to hamper the migration of additives. It is shown that, despite the lack of a conjugated backbone, the amide-based HTM can outperform state-of-the-art HTMs at a fraction of the cost, thereby providing a novel set of design strategies to develop new, low-cost HTMs.",amides; hole transporting materials; low-cost; perovskites; solar cells
2140,Spectral Magnitude Minimum Mean-Square Error Estimation Using Binary and Continuous Gain Functions,"Jensen, Jesper; Hendriks, Richard C.","Recently, binary mask techniques have been proposed as a tool for retrieving a target speech signal from a noisy observation. A binary gain function is applied to time-frequency tiles of the noisy observation in order to suppress noise dominated and retain target dominated time-frequency regions. When implemented using discrete Fourier transform (DFT) techniques, the binary mask techniques can be seen as a special case of the broader class of DFT-based speech enhancement algorithms, for which the applied gain function is not constrained to be binary. In this context, we develop and compare binary mask techniques to state-of-the-art continuous gain techniques. We derive spectral magnitude minimum mean-square error binary gain estimators; the binary gain estimators turn out to be simple functions of the continuous gain estimators. We show that the optimal binary estimators are closely related to a range of existing, heuristically developed, binary gain estimators. The derived binary gain estimators perform better than existing binary gain estimators in simulation experiments with speech signals contaminated by several different noise sources as measured by speech quality and intelligibility measures. However, even the best binary mask method is significantly outperformed by state-of-the-art continuous gain estimators.

The specific challenges in developing detect defectors involve the vagueness and tiny size of defects. To solve these problems, we propose incorporating super-resolution technique, sequential feature pyramid network, and boundary localization. Initially, the ensemble of enhanced super-resolution generative adversarial networks (ESRGAN) was proposed for the preprocessing stage to generate a more detailed contour of the original steel image. Next, in the detector section, the latest state-of-the-art feature pyramid network, known as De-tectoRS, utilized the recursive feature pyramid network technique to extract deeper multi-scale steel features by learning the feedback from the sequential feature pyramid network. Finally, Side-Aware Boundary Localization was used to precisely generate the output prediction of the defect detectors. We named our approach EnsGAN-SDD. Extensive experimental studies showed that the proposed methods improved the defect detector's performance, which also surpassed the accuracy of state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, the proposed EnsGAN achieved better performance and effectiveness in processing time compared with the original ESRGAN.

Here, a novel fluorescence biosensor based on double-stranded DNA branch migration-induced hybridization chain reaction (HCR) and DNAzyme feedback circuit was constructed for sensitive detection of P. aeruginosa. The binding of P. aeruginosa with its aptamer on a DNA three-way junction structure initiated the double-stranded DNA branch migration to form two DNA ""Y"" junction structures. One DNA ""Y"" junction structure opened the fluorescence-labelled DNA hairpins and triggered the HCR. The other DNA ""Y"" junction structure formed a double-stranded DNAzyme and cleaved the specific ribonucleotide site, producing new triggering probes to start the next cycle of the double-stranded DNA branch migration. Ultimately, a large number of DNA ""Y"" junction structures were produced, which greatly promoted signal amplification. Under optimized conditions, the proposed biosensor detected a wide linearity range of 102-107 CFU mL-1, and the limit of detection was 37 CFU mL-1 (S/N = 3). The recovery test results indicated that the biosensor has promising clinical application potential. Because of the simultaneous initiation of the HCR and the DNAzyme feedback circuit through the double-stranded DNA branch migration, the constructed biosensor provided an ideal platform for pathogenic bacteria detection without protein enzymes and complex signal amplification procedures.",DNA branch migration; DNAzyme; Fluorescence biosensor; Hybridization chain reaction; Pseudomonas aeruginosa.

AFSense-ECG demonstrates F1-measure of 86.13%, where the current state-of-the-art methods report F1-measures of 83.70%, 83.10%, 82.90%, 82.60%, 82.50%, 81.00% over publicly available single lead ECG datasets of Physionet 2017 Challenge. Further, the proposed learning model for the inferential sensing is lean (approximately 25 times simpler in terms of total number of trainable parameters with reduced model size than relevant state-of-the-art model, where the state-of-the-art method with 83.70% F1-measure consists of 10474607 trainable parameters, and our proposed model consists of 433675 trainable parameters) and more effective (better F1-measure than the state-of-the-art methods), which enables us to construct affordable intelligent sensing system.",Electrocardiography; Intelligent sensors; Convolutional neural networks; Lead; Medical services; Training; Heart; Electrocardiogram; atrial fibrillation; deep neural networks; intelligent sensors; remote monitoring; smart healthcare

Herein, a catalyst design concept of incorporating late transition metal into early transition metal carbide is proposed for regulating the metal-H bonding strength and largely enhancing the HER performance, which is employed to synthesize CoW bi-metallic carbide Co6 W6 C by a ""disassembly-assembly"" approach in a confined environment. Such synthesized Co6 W6 C nanocatalyst features the optimal Gibbs free energy of *H intermediate and dissociation barrier energy of H2 O molecules as well by taking advantage of the electron complementary effect between Co and W species, which endows the electrocatalyst with excellent HER performance in both alkaline and seawater/alkaline electrolytes featuring especially low overpotentials, elevated current densities, and much-enhanced operation durability in comparison to commercial Pt/C catalyst. Moreover, a proof-of-concept Mg/seawater battery equipped with Co6 W6 C-2-600 as cathode offers a peak power density of 9.1 mW cm-2 and an open-circuit voltage of ≈1.71 V, concurrently realizing hydrogen production and electricity output.",cage confinement; electronic modulation; hydrogen evolution reaction; tungsten-based bimetallic carbide.

In this study, a total of 331 CHB patients from three cohorts who underwent liver biopsy were enrolled, and the Scheuer system was used for liver fibrosis classification. The combined score was derived by principal component analysis of key differentially expressed genes. For significant liver fibrosis (≥S2), the areas under the receiver operating characteristics curves (AUROCs) of the combined score were 0.838, 0.842, and 0.881 in the three cohorts, respectively. And for advanced liver fibrosis (≥S3), the AUROCs were 0.794, 0.801, and 0.901, respectively. Compared with the results of AUROCs for aspartate aminotransferase≥to≥platelet ratio (APRI) and fibrosis index based on four factors (FIB-4) in the validation cohorts, better clinical diagnostic value for assessing the progression of liver fibrosis was found in the combined score. Additionally, univariate ordered logistic regression analysis indicated that the combined score could serve as a more superior and stable risk factor than APRI and FIB-4 in the assessment of liver fibrosis. For CHB patients with normal alanine aminotransferase (ALT), our results further emphasized the diagnostic value of the combined score for significant fibrosis (≥S2) and advanced fibrosis (≥S3). Moreover, it was found that patients with the high combined score, who were associated with the advanced fibrosis stage, had higher levels of drug sensitivity and immune checkpoint expression. In conclusion, the novel combined score could serve as a potential biomarker and contribute to improving the assessment of fibrosis stage in CHB patients.",bioinformatics; chronic hepatitis B; clinical diagnostic value; combined score; immune checkpoint; liver fibrosis.

Chrysodeixis includens (Walker) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) is one of the main polyphagous pests of soybean in Brazil that can benefit from weeds' presence during season and off-season. Despite its pest status, little is known about C. includens survival and development on alternative hosts, including those resistant to glyphosate. Therefore, we assessed the biology, reproduction, preference, and survival at different feeding periods of C. includens on seven glyphosate-resistant weeds (Sumatran fleabane, Italian ryegrass, sourgrass, goosegrass, smooth pigweed, wild poinsettia, hairy beggarticks) commonly found in Brazilian agroecosystems, under laboratory conditions. Our results showed that C. includens survival and reproduction were similar on soybean and wild poinsettia. Survival and reproduction were lower on smooth pigweed and hairy beggarticks. Also, these plants prolonged the larval stage. Larvae did not pupate when fed on sourgrass, goosegrass, Italian ryegrass, and Sumatran fleabane. However, on Sumatran fleabane their biomass was higher. The mean generation time was lower on wild poinsettia. This weed was preferred to soybean. An antifeeding factor was observed on Sumatran fleabane. Larvae fed for 11 days on soybean, wild poinsettia and smooth pigweed developed into pupae. In agricultural systems, farmers must pay attention to the management of these weeds, especially wild poinsettia, smooth pigweed, and hairy beggarticks, to interrupt the cycle of this pest, since these plants can serve as main sources of infestation for the soybean crop.",Biology; IPM; green bridge; no-tillage; soybean looper.

In this paper, a new method is proposed for sign identification and number comparison based on an optimized version of the mixed radix conversion for the augmented 3-moduli sets . Notably, most of the computations are directly performed on the moduli channels, thus allowing to easily adapt this new method to any RNS processor. Accordingly, this paper proposes an efficient unified very large scale integration architecture based on the presented methodology, which can be used not only to design application specific integrated circuits (ASICs) but also to configure field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs). The implementation results that were obtained using CMOS technologies show that the proposed architecture provided comparators that are more efficient than the related state of the art, by considering as a figure of merit the area time product. More specifically, the considered ASIC and FPGA implementations provide relative improvements in the efficiency of up to 57 and , respectively. The experimental assessment also shows that the power consumption of the proposed circuits is significantly lower than the related state of the art, with relative reductions of up to .",Residue number systems; Mixed radix conversion; Sign detection; Number comparison
2150,Elemental profile of native lichens displaying the impact by agricultural and artificial land uses in the Atlantic island of Sao Miguel (Azores),"Bernardo, Filipe; Rodrigues, Armindo; Branquinho, Cristina; Garcia, Patricia","Smaller oceanic islands, often hosting endangered native habitats, are particularly vulnerable to the impact of human activities. Using lichens as bioindicators, this study aimed to test if agricultural (AGR) and artificial (ART) land uses are noticeably more impacted than forest (FOR) land use on an oceanic island (Sao Miguel, Azores). Livestock and farming practices in AGR areas involve the intensive application of synthetical agrochemicals as well as organic fertilizers and manure. ART areas accommodate vehicular traffic besides industries dedicated to waste management, energy production or exploration and transformation of raw materials. Naturally occurring Parmotrema lichens were collected in 28 sampling sites distributed between each land use. The concentrations of 58 elements as well as the percentage (%N) and the isotopic composition of nitrogen (delta N-15) were determined on lichen samples. An overall pattern of significant elemental enrichment was observed in lichens from AGR and ART sites compared with FOR lichens, including several rare-earth elements. FOR lichens were noticeably cleaner, thus providing background concentrations for the calculation of bioaccumulation ratios. Bioaccumulation levels were generally low to moderate in AGR lichens and moderate to high in ART lichens, including toxic heavy metals. %N was highest in AGR lichens and its isotopic signature was distinguishable from ART lichens by significantly lower delta N-15 values. This study provides a comprehensive baseline of bioaccumulation data across major land uses for comparison with other insular regions, highlighting the greater vulnerability of island ecosystems to anthropogenic impacts even if by relatively small-scale human activities.

NEF is a framework that is capable of synthesising large-scale cognitive systems from subnetworks and we have previously presented an FPGA implementation of the NEF that successfully performs non linear mathematical computations. That work was developed based on a compact digital neural core, which consists of 64 neurons that are instantiated by a single physical neuron using a time multiplexing approach. We have now scaled this approach up to build a pattern recognition system by combining identical neural cores together. As a proof of concept, we have developed a handwritten digit recognition system using the MNIST database and achieved a recognition rate of 96.55%. The system is implemented on a state-of-the-art FPGA and can process 5.12 million digits per second.

It demonstrated significant advantages in accuracy and speed factors than other approaches with its deeper convolutional network structure, more accurate image reconstruction and real-time model execution. The proposed approach categorizes layers in branches and increases the number of layers to 35 with parallel local residual learning. Also, it adapts the Adam optimizer which can make the proposed system to achieve faster training speed and better image quality. Our experiments have been conducted using standard benchmark datasets such as Set5, Set14, BSDS100 and Urban100 and compared with current state-of-the-art approaches.

2154,A branch and bound irredundant graph algorithm for large-scale MLCS problems,"Wang, Chunyang; Wang, Yuping; Cheung, Yiuming","Finding the multiple longest common subsequences (MLCS) among many long sequences (i.e., the large scale MLCS problem) has many important applications, such as gene alignment, disease diagnosis, and documents similarity check, etc. It is an NP-hard problem (Maier et al., 1978). The key bottle neck of this problem is that the existing state-of-the-art algorithms must construct a huge graph (called direct acyclic graph, briefly DAG), and the computer usually has no enough space to store and handle this graph. Thus the existing algorithms cannot solve the large scale MLCS problem. In order to quickly solve the large-scale MLCS problem within limited computer resources, this paper therefore proposes a branch and bound irredundant graph algorithm called Big-MLCS, which constructs a much smaller DAG (called SmallDAG) than the existing algorithms do by a branch and bound method, and designs a new data structure to efficiently store and handle Small-DAG. By these schemes, Big-MLCS is more efficient than the existing algorithms. Also, we compare the proposed algorithm with two state-of-the-art algorithms through the experiments, and the results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms the compared algorithms and is more suitable to large-scale MLCS problems.

Hereby, a facile low-temperature reduction protocol was adopted for synthesizing CoN4-supported Co2N metal clusters on graphitic carbon nitride, which show the remarkably superior chemiluminescent (CL) catalytic capacity than some reported pure single-atom site catalysts. Nitrogen-encapsulated Co2N clusters coupled with isolated Co-N4 moieties (Co2N@Co-N4) endowed the synergetic catalysts with high Co content of 53.2 wt%. Through X-ray absorption spectroscopy, the synergetic active sites (Co2N@Co-N4) afforded the CoN4-supported Co2N clusters with the remarkable catalytic activity for accelerating the decomposition of H2O2 to produce extensive superoxide radical anion rather than singlet oxygen or hydroxyl radical. Therefore, the CoN4-supported Co2N clusters possessed the superb enhancement effect on luminol-H2O2 CL reaction by ∼22829 times. The CoN4-supported Co2N clusters were utilized as signal probes to establish a CL immunochromatographic assay (ICA) platform for quantitating mycotoxins. Herein, aflatoxin B1 was employed as a mode analyte and the limit of detection was as low as 0.33 pg mL-1 (3σ). As a proof-of-principle work, the developed ICA protocol was successfully employed on the detection of aflatoxin B1 spiked in Angelica dahurica and Ganoderma lucidum with acceptable recoveries of 84.0-107.0%.

2156,A fuzzy rule based multimodal framework for face sketch-to-photo retrieval,"Khan, Mohd Aamir; Jalal, Anand Singh","Facial sketches are widely used by law enforcement agencies to assist in the identification and apprehension of suspects involved in criminal activities. Sketches used in forensic investigations are drawn by forensic artists following the verbal description provided by an eyewitness or the victim. In a forensic sketch, the facial description depends on the memory of the eyewitness, therefore, there is uncertainty in facial attributes. Most of the existing sketch-photo retrieval methods have ignored the uncertainty of facial attributes. In this paper, we have proposed a novel multimodal framework for sketch-photo retrieval. We have fused the facial attributes and the semantic color information using a fuzzy rule based layered classifier. We have also performed a survey to rank the importance of different facial attributes in the identification of a person. We have performed experiments using viewed, semi-forensic and forensic sketches dataset and results are compared with state-of-the-art methods. Experimental results show that the proposed fuzzy rule based method achieves promising performance as compared to state-of-art methods specifically in case of forensic sketches.

We conducted semi-structured telephone interviews (n = 22) with providers in high/low performing and/or resourced communities across the U.S. in May and June 2021 and analysed transcripts using template analysis. Themes described by providers highlight how infrastructure limitations in rural areas can exacerbate health disparities for Veterans experiencing housing instability, the impact of COVID-19 on service access, and recommendations to enhance service delivery. Providers suggested that VHA reconfigure where and how staff work, identify additional resources for transportation and/or alternative transportation models, and increase Veterans' access to technology and broadband Internet. Federal infrastructure investments should address challenges faced by Veterans experiencing housing instability in rural areas and the concerns of providers connecting them with care.",healthcare; homeless; housing instability; infrastructure; rural; veteran.

Recent advancements of the Internet of Things (IoT) have bolstered automated EAR through various wearable edge devices. State-of-the-art work uses some offline trained classifiers at the fog device to recognize eating activities. However, the eating habits of a person change quite frequently and vary from person to person. Therefore, the classifiers should be updated continuously with new data to adapt to these changes and be personalized over time through online learning. To the best of our knowledge, no state-of-the-art work has addressed this issue so far. In this article, we propose an online learning methodology called human eating activity recognition (HEAR) by introducing an online update phase. We also design an algorithm to be used in the online update phase that provides approximate true labels for the new data. Moreover, we also design a wearable neckband as the edge device to capture eating activity data (<italic>Chewing, Swallowing, Talking, and Idle</italic>) in a lab environment. Through a detailed experimental evaluation on 12 users, we show that an online learned neural network (OLNN) classifier using our HEAR methodology performs better than any state-of-the-art offline trained classifier.

2159,Fast-Growing Saccharomyces cerevisiae Cells with a Constitutive Unfolded Protein Response and Their Potential for Lipidic Molecule Production,"Phuong Thi Mai Nguyen,Yuki Ishiwata-Kimata,Yukio Kimata,Phuong Thi Mai Nguyen,Yuki Ishiwata-Kimata,Yukio Kimata","In Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells, dysfunction of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), so-called ER stress, leads to conversion of HAC1 mRNA to the spliced form (HAC1i), which is translated into a transcription factor that drastically changes the gene expression profile. This cellular response ultimately enhances ER functions and is named the unfolded protein response (UPR). Artificial evocation of the UPR is therefore anticipated to increase productivity of beneficial materials on and in the ER. However, as demonstrated here, cells constitutively expressing HAC1i mRNA (HAC1i cells), which exhibited a strong UPR even under nonstress conditions, grew considerably slowly and frequently yielded fast-growing and low-UPR progeny. Intriguingly, growth of HAC1i cells was faster in the presence of weak ER stress that was induced by low concentrations of the ER stressor tunicamycin or by cellular expression of the ER-located version of green fluorescent protein (GFP). HAC1i cells producing ER-localized GFP stably exhibited a strong UPR activity, carried a highly expanded ER, and abundantly produced triglycerides and heterogenous carotenoids. We therefore propose that our findings provide a basis for metabolic engineering to generate cells producing valuable lipidic molecules. IMPORTANCE The UPR is thought to be a cellular response to cope with the accumulation of unfolded proteins in the ER. In S. cerevisiae cells, the UPR is severely repressed under nonstress conditions. The findings of this study shed light on the physiological significance of the tight regulation of the UPR. Constitutive UPR induction caused considerable growth retardation, which was partly rescued by the induction of weak ER stress. Therefore, we speculate that when the UPR is inappropriately induced in unstressed cells lacking aberrant ER client proteins, the UPR improperly impairs normal cellular functions. Another important point of this study was the generation of S. cerevisiae strains stably exhibiting a strong UPR activity and abundantly producing triglycerides and heterogenous carotenoids. We anticipate that our findings may be applied to produce valuable lipidic molecules using yeast cells as a potential next-generation technique.",Saccharomyces cerevisiae; endoplasmic reticulum; endoplasmic reticulum stress; lipid synthesis; stress response; unfolded protein response.
2160,Scale Sequence Joint Deep Learning (SS-JDL) for land use and land cover classification,"Zhang, Ce; Harrison, Paula A.; Pan, Xin; Li, Huapeng; Sargent, Isabel; Atkinson, Peter M.","Choosing appropriate scales for remotely sensed image classification is extremely important yet still an open question in relation to deep convolutional neural networks (CNN), due to the impact of spatial scale (i.e., input patch size) on the recognition of ground objects. Currently, the optimal scale selection processes are extremely cumbersome and time-consuming requiring repetitive experiments involving trial-and-error procedures, which significantly reduce the practical utility of the corresponding classification methods. This issue is crucial when trying to classify large-scale land use (LU) and land cover (LC) jointly (Zhang et al., 2019). In this paper, a simple and parsimonious Scale Sequence Joint Deep Learning (SS-JDL) method is proposed for joint LU and LC classification, in which a sequence of scales is embedded in the iterative process of fitting the joint distribution implicit in the joint deep learning (JDL) method, thus, replacing the previous paradigm of scale selection. The sequence of scales, derived autonomously and used to define the CNN input patch sizes, provides consecutive information transmission from small-scale features to large-scale representations, and from simple LC states to complex LU characterisations. The effectiveness of the novel SS-JDL method was tested on aerial digital photography of three complex and heterogeneous landscapes, two in Southern England (Bournemouth and Southampton) and one in North West England (Manchester). Benchmark comparisons were provided in the form of a range of LU and LC methods, including the state-of-the-art joint deep learning (JDL) method. The experimental results demonstrated that the SS-JDL consistently outperformed all of the state-of-the-art baselines in terms of both LU and LC classification accuracies, as well as computational efficiency. The proposed SS-JDL method, therefore, represents a fast and effective implementation of the state-of-the-art JDL method. By creating a single, unifying joint distribution framework for classifying higher order feature representations, including LU, the SS-JDL method has the potential to transform the classification paradigm in remote sensing, and in machine learning more generally.",Multi-scale deep learning; Optimal scale selection; Convolutional neural network; Joint classification; Hierarchical representations

Along with its mosquito vector, the Alphavirus chikungunya virus (CHIKV) has spread explosively in the last 20 years, and there is no approved treatment for chikungunya fever. On the plasma membrane of the infected cell, CHIKV generates dedicated organelles for viral RNA replication, so-called spherules. Whereas structures exist for several viral proteins that make up the spherule, the architecture of the full organelle is unknown. Here, we use cryo-electron tomography to image CHIKV spherules in their cellular context. This reveals that the viral protein nsP1 serves as a base for the assembly of a larger protein complex at the neck of the membrane bud. Biochemical assays show that the viral helicase-protease nsP2, while having no membrane affinity on its own, is recruited to membranes by nsP1. The tomograms further reveal that full-sized spherules contain a single copy of the viral genome in double-stranded form. Finally, we present a mathematical model that explains the membrane remodeling of the spherule in terms of the pressure exerted on the membrane by the polymerizing RNA, which provides a good agreement with the experimental data. The energy released by RNA polymerization is found to be sufficient to remodel the membrane to the characteristic spherule shape.",Alphavirus; cryo-electron tomography; membrane dynamics; molecular biophysics; physics of living systems; simulations; structural biology; virus replication; viruses.

Androgen deprivation therapy is initially effective in most instances of AR-positive advanced or metastatic PCa. However, patients inevitably develop lethal castration-resistant PCa (CRPC), which is also resistant to the next-generation AR signaling inhibitors. Most CRPCs maintain AR expression, and blocking AR signaling remains a main therapeutic approach. GATA2 is a pioneer transcription factor emerging as a key therapeutic target for PCa because it promotes AR expression and activation. While directly inhibiting GATA2 transcriptional activity remains challenging, enhancing GATA2 degradation is a plausible therapeutic strategy. How GATA2 protein stability is regulated in PCa remains unknown. Here, we show that constitutive photomorphogenesis protein 1 (COP1), an E3 ubiquitin ligase, drives GATA2 ubiquitination at K419/K424 for degradation. GATA2 lacks a conserved [D/E](x)xxVP[D/E] degron but uses alternate BR1/BR2 motifs to bind COP1. By promoting GATA2 degradation, COP1 inhibits AR expression and activation and represses PCa cell and xenograft growth and castration resistance. Accordingly, GATA2 overexpression or COP1 mutations that disrupt COP1-GATA2 binding block COP1 tumor-suppressing activities. We conclude that GATA2 is a major COP1 substrate in PCa and that COP1 promotion of GATA2 degradation is a direct mechanism for regulating AR expression and activation, PCa growth, and castration resistance.",AR; COP1; GATA2; prostate cancer; ubiquitination.

Though these techniques are prone to have variability, they can be robust tools for quantifying DNA damage when planned and executed carefully. Here, we present both assays and highlight each technique's advantages and challenges in measuring DNA damage in cells with limiting cell number, such as hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). The Comet assay is highly sensitive at the cost of increased variability. The Halo assay attenuates some of the effects of variability present in the Comet assay but does not eliminate them entirely and is less sensitive. Overall, the Comet and Halo assays are powerful means of directly measuring DNA damage. We recommend the below methods for detecting damage in hematopoietic stem cells, but the methods can easily be adjusted for measuring damage in any type of single cells in suspension.",Comet assay; DNA damage; Electrophoresis; Fast Halo Assay; Hematopoietic stem cell.

This is a descriptive and cross-sectional study. The study included total of 144 patients who had burn injuries, received treatment in a research and training hospital and were scheduled to be discharged. The data were collected prospectively by the researchers, using descriptive methods, Kruskal Wallis test, paired samples t test, and Pearson's correlation analysis. Of the patients, 59% were between the ages of 18 and 35 years, 68.1% were male, 65.3% had second-degree burns, 77.1% had burn surfaces ranging between 10% and 20% of their body, and 54.9% had autograft surgery. The burn patients aged 51 years and over had higher perceived stress than younger patients, and the difference between them was statistically significant (P < 0.05). As the percentage of burn surface increased, the perceived stress increased, and the perceived body image weakened (P < 0.05). The burn patients with autograft surgery had lower perceived stress and higher perceived body image than those without autograft surgery, and the difference between them was statistically significant (P < 0.01). This study found an inverse relationship between perceived stress and body image in burn patients, which was affected by the percentage of burn surface and autograft surgery. Relevant interventions are suggested to increase perceived body image in burn patients and reduce their perceived stress.",body image; burn; burn injury; perceived stress.

A cocktail of cytokines was used to differentiate KG1 to dendritic like cells (termed dKG1) and the effects of nine chemicals (respiratory and contact sensitisers) and an irritant control on surface marker expression, 'antigen presenting' function and cytokine expression investigated. The stability of these chemicals when dissolved was characterised using MALDI ToF MS. A Hill plot model was used with the cellular viability data to quantify the lethal dose 50% (LD50) and a maximum sub toxic concentration of each chemical defined. Cytokine expression by the treated dKG1 was quantified using multiplex immunobead analysis. Whilst dKG1 cells were morphologically similar to DCs, expression of specific surface markers was not typical for DCs derived from healthy precursor cells. When the chemicals were applied at defined sub toxic doses no effects on dKG1 phenotype, function, or cytokine expression, attributable to the sensitisation properties were discriminated. However, dKG1 cells were much more sensitive to the toxic effects of these chemicals compared to the parent KG1 cells. Only 4 of the 9 chemicals tested were stable when dissolved indicating that the effect of sensitising chemicals on antigen presenting cells may be related to species other than the parent compound.",Chemicals; Dendritic cells; Hill model; KG1; Sensitisation.

Cephalosporins are a successful group of antibiotics to combat pathogenic microorganisms, including drug-resistant strains. In this study, we investigated the effect of newly synthesized cephalosporin derivatives with cyclic disulfide modifications against several Gram-positive and Gram-negative strains as well as against biofilm formation. The incorporation of asparagusic acid was found to be effective in improving the activity of the drug against Gram-negative strains compared to the all carbon-control compounds. Furthermore, we could demonstrate the successful reduction of biofilm formation for Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa at similar concentrations as obtained against planktonic cells. We propose that the incorporation of cyclic disulfides is one additional strategy to improve antibiotic activity and to combat bacterial infections.",antimicrobials; bacteria; biofilm; cephalosporin; disulfides.

This paper proposes a no-reference video quality assessment model based on visual memory understanding. Inspired by the findings of neuroscience researchers, who argue there is a large overlap between the active human brain area when performing video quality assessment and saliency detection tasks, saliency maps are employed here to assist the quality assessment. To this end, we first generate the saliency maps using CLBP (Complete Local Binary Patterns) features of the residual frames. Then, a model of visual memory is created from the statistics of saliency maps. This is followed by learning the video quality from the visual memory, saliency, and frame features through a support vector regression pipeline. The experimental results on the state-of-the-art LIVE and SJTU video datasets indicate that the proposed no-reference video quality assessment algorithm is effective and performs statistically better than several other state-of-the-art approaches.",Visualization; Quality assessment; Video recording; Streaming media; Feature extraction; Observers; Saliency detection; No-reference video quality; visual memory; saliency detection; short-term memory; long-term memory

We present the results of our analysis of the indoor thermal conditions during the period from January 2011 to December 2016. Real data were collected from strategically located probes inside the cathedral and from an outside weather station. The results were compared with an EnergyPlus computer model to verify the calculations and improve decision making. The model considers the envelope's thermal inertia, the characteristics of the enclosure, and the passive systems for performing thermal analysis. The cathedral's indoor environment is very stable. Because of a high capability of thermal-energy accumulation, a one-month thermal lag between indoor and outdoor temperatures exists. Furthermore, the maximum and minimum temperatures are dampened, with a two-degree variation above or below the outdoor average, depending on the season. The outdoor humidity can vary from 40% to 100% daily, whereas the indoor humidity variation is around 5%. This indoor stable condition protects the artistic objects in the building. This six-year monitoring and analysis allows for the determination that high-inertia buildings are suitable for displaying and preserving pieces of art and antique furniture, protecting them from deterioration.",thermal inertia; temperature; simulation; cathedral; indoor conditions; EnergyPlus model; monitoring; thermal behavior
2173,Applying a Foucauldian lens to the Canadian code of ethics for registered nurses as a discursive mechanism for nurses professional identity,"Janet K Purvis,Janet K Purvis","This study examines the Canadian Code of Ethics for Registered Nurses as a discursive mechanism for shaping nurses' professional identity using a Foucauldian lens. Nurses are considered essential in healthcare, yet the nursing profession has struggled to be recognized for its discipline-specific knowledge and expertise and, as such, has remained the subject of and subject to the dominant discourses within healthcare and society generally. Developing a professional identity in nursing begins after the necessary education and training are achieved and embodies the profession's history, values, code of ethics, and expectations of the profession that distinguish it from other professions. Since nurses' professional identity is shaped through discourse, it raises the question of whether there are spaces to reconceptualize nurses' subject position within health care. Since professional identity is considered the embodiment of knowledge and practice, the code of ethics bears examination both for its effect on nurses' professional identity and as a potential site from which to challenge hegemonic assumptions. This article discusses the concept of professional identity in nursing and its development through the discursive formations in the code of ethics. The sources of power/knowledge are examined as both mechanisms of control and as spaces for change.",Foucault; code of ethics; discursive mechanism; nursing; professional identity.

Its exact recipe has been preserved untouched and in deep secret for more than six centuries yet, and has been passed down from generation to generation. Six patients were included in this case series one patient with malignant melanoma of the skin after re-excision with subsequent non-free skin surgical plastic, two patients with III degree skin burning and three patients with infected wound successfully treated with Theresienöl. All of them - before the application of Theresienöl - were treated with different operative methods. The treatment of scars from operative interventions with Theresienöl is very effective. That is why it must start directly after the operative intervention. The therapeutic effect of Theresienöl for postoperative scars is commensurable with and even better than the one of all applied until now local medicines, which makes it an agent of choice in those cases. Theresienöl represents a good alternative to the free skin surgical plastic for small burns of III degree. The local treatment of infected wounds with Theresienoil is more effective and economically sound than the treatment with all the rest types of dressings. The effects from the treatment of different surgical diseases with Theresienöl occur very rapidly, while there is a very good response to local hematomas, pain, and itchiness by the medicine, and there are no side effects from its administration.",III degree skin burning; Infected wounds; Scars; Theresienöl.
2175,Toward better boundary preserved supervoxel segmentation for 3D point clouds,"Lin, Yangbin; Wang, Cheng; Zhai, Dawei; Li, Wei; Li, Jonathan","Supervoxels provide a more natural and compact representation of three dimensional point clouds, and enable the operations to be performed on regions rather than on the scattered points. Many state-of-the-art supervoxel segmentation methods adopt fixed resolution for each supervoxel, and rely on the initialization of seed points. As a result, they may not preserve well the boundaries of the point cloud with a non-uniform density. In this paper, we present a simple but effective supervoxel segmentation method for point clouds, which formalizes supervoxel segmentation as a subset selection problem. We develop an heuristic algorithm that utilizes local information to efficiently solve the subset selection problem. The proposed method can produce supervoxels with adaptive resolutions, and dose not rely the selection of seed points. The method is fully tested on three publicly available point cloud segmentation benchmarks, which cover the major point cloud types. The experimental results show that compared with the state-of-the-art supervoxel segmentation methods, the supervoxels extracted using our method preserve the object boundaries and small structures more effectively, which is reflected in a higher boundary recall and lower under-segmentation error.",Supervoxel segmentation; Point clouds; Subset selection; Over-segmentation
2176,Mediastinal Lymph Node Detection and Segmentation Using Deep Learning,"Nayan, Al-Akhir; Kijsirikul, Boonserm; Iwahori, Yuji","Automatic lymph node (LN) segmentation and detection for cancer staging are critical. In clinical practice, computed tomography (CT) and positron emission tomography (PET) imaging detect abnormal LNs. Despite its low contrast and variety in nodal size and form, LN segmentation remains a challenging task. Deep convolutional neural networks frequently segment items in medical photographs. Most state-of-the-art techniques destroy image's resolution through pooling and convolution. As a result, the models provide unsatisfactory results. Keeping the issues in mind, a well-established deep learning technique UNet++ was modified using bilinear interpolation and total generalized variation (TGV) based upsampling strategy to segment and detect mediastinal lymph nodes. The modified UNet++ maintains texture discontinuities, selects noisy areas, searches appropriate balance points through backpropagation, and recreates image resolution. Collecting CT image data from TCIA, 5-patients, and ELCAP public dataset, a dataset was prepared with the help of experienced medical experts. The UNet++ was trained using those datasets, and three different data combinations were utilized for testing. Utilizing the proposed approach, the model achieved 94.8% accuracy, 91.9% Jaccard, 94.1% recall, and 93.1% precision on COMBO_3.

Whilst a lot of research has been done to unravel variability of PSII fluorescence in response to biotic and abiotic factors, the contribution of PSI to in vivo fluorescence measurements has often been neglected or considered to be constant. Furthermore, little is known about how the absorption and emission properties of PSI from different plant species differ. In this study, we have isolated PSI from five plant species and compared their characteristics using a combination of optical and biochemical techniques. Differences have been identified in the fluorescence emission spectra and at the protein level, whereas the absorption spectra were virtually the same in all cases. In addition, the emission spectrum of PSI depends on temperature over a physiologically relevant range from 280 to 298 K.

2178,Face recognition using color local binary pattern from mutually independent color channels,"Anbarjafari, Gholamreza","In this article, a high performance face recognition system based on local binary pattern (LBP) using the probability distribution functions (PDFs) of pixels in different mutually independent color channels which are robust to frontal homogenous illumination and planer rotation is proposed. The illumination of faces is enhanced by using the state-of-the-art technique which is using discrete wavelet transform and singular value decomposition. After equalization, face images are segmented by using local successive mean quantization transform followed by skin color-based face detection system. Kullback-Leibler distance between the concatenated PDFs of a given face obtained by LBP and the concatenated PDFs of each face in the database is used as a metric in the recognition process. Various decision fusion techniques have been used in order to improve the recognition rate. The proposed system has been tested on the FERET, HP, and Bosphorus face databases. The proposed system is compared with conventional and the state-of-the-art techniques. The recognition rates obtained using FVF approach for FERET database is 99.78% compared with 79.60 and 68.80% for conventional gray-scale LBP and principle component analysis-based face recognition techniques, respectively.",Illumination robust; Local binary pattern; Face recognition; Probability distribution function; Discrete wavelet transform; Kullback-Leibler distance
2179,MRI Upsampling Using Feature-Based Nonlocal Means Approach,"Jafari-Khouzani, Kourosh","In magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), spatial resolution is limited by several factors such as acquisition time, short physiological phenomena, and organ motion. The acquired image usually has higher resolution in two dimensions (the acquisition plane) in comparison with the third dimension, resulting in highly anisotropic voxel size. Interpolation of these low resolution (LR) images using standard techniques, such as linear or spline interpolation, results in distorted edges in the planes perpendicular to the acquisition plane. This poses limitation on conducting quantitative analyses of LR images, particularly on their voxel-wise analysis and registration. We have proposed a new non-local means feature- based technique that uses structural information of a high resolution (HR) image with a different contrast and interpolates the LR image. In this approach, the similarity between voxels is estimated using a feature vector that characterizes the laminar pattern of the brain structures, resulting in a more accurate similarity measure in comparison with conventional patch-based approach. This technique can be applied to LR images with both anisotropic and isotropic voxel sizes. Experimental results conducted on brain MRI scans of patients with brain tumors, multiple sclerosis, epilepsy, as well as schizophrenic patients and normal controls show that the proposed method is more accurate, requires fewer computations, and thus is significantly faster than a previous state-of-the-art patch-based technique. We also show how the proposed method may be used to upsample regions of interest drawn on LR images.",Interpolation; magnetic resonance imaging (MRI); nonlocal means; super-resolution; upsampling

The Algebraic Reconstruction Technique (ART) is applied to optical depth maps from sky images to reconstruct 3-D cloud extinction coefficients without considering multiple scattering effects. Reconstruction accuracy is explored for different products, including surface irradiance and extinction coefficients, and as a function of the number of available sky imagers and setup distance. Increasing the number of imagers improves the accuracy of the 3-D reconstruction: for surface irradiance, the error decreases significantly up to four imagers at which point the improvements become marginal. But using nine imagers gives more robust results in practical situations in which the circumsolar region of images has to be excluded due to poor cloud detection. The ideal distance between imagers was also explored: for a cloud height of 1 km, increasing distance up to 3 km (the domain length) improved the 3-D reconstruction. An iterative reconstruction technique that iteratively updated the source function improved the results of the ART by minimizing the error between input red radiance images and reconstructed red radiance simulations. For the best case of a nine-imager deployment, the ART and iterative method resulted in 53.4% and 33.6% relative mean absolute error for the extinction coefficients, respectively.",3D cloud reconstruction; Tomography; Cloud optical depth; Sky imager; Solar forecasting
2181,Automatic quality inspection in additive manufacturing using semi-supervised deep learning,"Manivannan, Siyamalan","Ensuring quality production is essential in additive manufacturing processes such as selective laser sintering (SLS). Deep learning based automated systems may provide a better way for real time monitoring to ensure quality production. These systems are usually trained in a fully supervised manner which require large amount of labeled data. Obtaining labeled training data in large quantities is a tedious and time consuming process. To overcome this, a novel semi-supervised deep learning approach is proposed in this work, which can be trained using both labeled and unlabeled data, and hence, reducing the manual labeling efforts needed to train the system. Experimental results on a SLS powder bed defect detection dataset show that the proposed approach is the new state-of-the-art, and shows its potential as a standalone real time monitoring system for SLS. In this dataset the proposed approach beats the state-of-the-art accuracy of 98% with only 25% of the labeled training data compared to other approaches. In addition, an extensive set of experiments were conducted on three additional public defect inspection datasets (NEU steel surface defects, KolektorSDD surface images of plastic electronics commutators, and surface textures) to show the applicability of the proposed approach on other computer integrated manufacturing environments for quality inspection. In all of these datasets the proposed approach beats the state-of-the-art results with relatively small amounts of training data compared to other approaches, which shows the effectiveness of the proposed approach for real time, automated, and accurate quality inspection.",Additive manufacturing; Computer-integrated manufacturing; Semi-supervised learning; Surface defect recognition

Focusing on surrogate-assisted microwave filter designs, this article first analyzes the characteristic of filter design based on different design objective functions. Then, the state-of-the-art filter design methodologies are reviewed, including surrogate modeling (machine learning) methods and advanced optimization algorithms. Three essential techniques in filter designs are included: 1) smart data sampling techniques; 2) advanced surrogate modeling techniques; and 3) advanced optimization methods and frameworks. To achieve success and stability, they have to be tailored or combined together to achieve the specific characteristics of the microwave filters.

A detailed understanding of the impacts for informal workers, the public policy approaches that could most effectively respond to their needs, and the barriers to such policy, is urgently needed. This paper discusses the results of a 2021 street vendor survey in Cali, Colombia, focusing on (1) vendors' socioeconomic circumstances and (2) their political engagement and attitudes on key policy and governance issues. It argues that while the pandemic and the government responses to it negatively impacted street vendors, there are steps that government could have taken, and can still take, to address vendors' needs and priorities. To ensure a just, equitable, sustainable recovery, and to protect economically marginalized groups from future crises, informal workers must be more meaningfully included in decision-making processes.",COVID-19; Colombia; global South; informal economy; street vendors.

P.; Veljkovic, Milan; Berto, Filippo","Wind, as a sustainable and affordable energy source, represents a strong alternative to traditional energy sources. However, wind power is only one of the options, together with other renewable energy sources. Consequently, the core concerns for wind turbine manufacturers and operators are to increase its reliability and decrease costs, therefore enhancing commercial competitiveness. Among typical failure modes of wind turbines, fatigue is a common and critical source. Given the significance of fatigue reliability in wind turbine structural integrity, reliable probabilistic fatigue theories are necessary for design scheme optimization. By reducing the expenses on manufacturing, operation, and maintenance in reliability-and cost-optimal ways, the cost of energy can be significantly reduced. This study systematically reviews the state-of-the-art technology for fatigue reliability of wind turbines, and elaborates on the evolution of methodology in wind load uncertainty modelling. In addition, fatigue reliability assessment techniques on four typical components are summarized.

The online social space is appropriate for cultural products to be viral, since users of SNS mainly share personal interest and spread hedonic consumption with close friends and acquaintances. If viral content drives strong emotions such as joy, arousal, pleasure, sorrow, or horror, it will be transmitted to more people, and rapidly. This study investigates how a certain type of motivation for using a social network service such as Facebook influences trust in art and culture exhibition information providers and the content of the information itself. Results show that people who have an informational motivation for using social media expressed a higher degree of trust in exhibition information provided by institutions such as museums. On the contrary, those who have relational motivation for using social media credited acquaintances such as friends, families, and colleagues more. Trust in the information provider resulted in trust in the content itself, and hence, increased the possibility of word-of-mouth for the corresponding information. An empirical survey was implemented, using followers of the Facebook page of a national museum and users who clicked ""Like"" on postings of exhibitions. Finally, the potential applications of the result for promotion and marketing of exhibitions of art and culture for public will be discussed.",SNS; informational; relational; motivation; Facebook; art; culture; museum; trust; word-of-mouth

Deep hashing methods have achieved great success on single-label retrieval. However, the multi-level similarities between samples in multi-label scenarios have not been fully explored. In this letter, based on the in-depth analysis of the complex semantic similarities of multi-label images, the Multi-Central Ranking Loss (MCR Loss) for deep hashing is proposed to construct a powerful metric space that not only preserves the fine-grained similarities of multi-label images but also has low quantization error. The proposed MCR Loss utilizes learnable hash centers and similarities of data-to-data pairs to optimize the metric space, which greatly alleviates the embedding conflict caused by proxy-based supervision, and reduces the quantization error. The proposed method is compared with several existing state-of-the-art hashing methods on two public multi-label benchmarks.

In an augmented reality (AR)-based surgery navigation system, the highlight may also lead to the failure of feature extraction or registration. In this paper, we propose an adaptive robust principal component analysis (Adaptive-RPCA) method to remove the specular reflections in endoscopic image sequences. It can iteratively optimize the sparse part parameter during RPCA decomposition. In this new approach, we first adaptively detect the highlight image based on pixels. With the proposed distance metric algorithm, it then automatically measures the similarity distance between the sparse result image and the detected highlight image. Finally, the low-rank and sparse results are obtained by enforcing the similarity distance between the two types of images to fall within a certain range. Our method has been verified by multiple different types of endoscopic image sequences in minimally invasive surgery (MIS). The experiments and clinical blind tests demonstrate that the new Adaptive-RPCA method can obtain the optimal sparse decomposition parameters directly and can generate robust highlight removal results. Compared with the state-of-the-art approaches, the proposed method not only achieves the better highlight removal results but also can adaptively process image sequences.",Specular reflections; detection; highlight removal; robust principal component analysis

2191,Food security for survivors of intimate partner violence: Understanding the role of food in survivor well-being,"Sidney Brandhorst,Dessie Lee Clark,Sidney Brandhorst,Dessie Lee Clark","Intimate partner violence (IPV) and food security are two leading public health issues that disproportionately impact women in the United States. Despite this connection, the relationship between IPV and food security has been relatively unexplored. While food security is a known factor in increased well-being, it is not often explicitly included in care for survivors. As part of a larger study on survivors of domestic violence who are receiving services from a domestic violence and sexual assault agency in the Southern United States, we analysed participant responses (n = 26) to various scales (i.e. depression, anxiety, PTSD, disability, well-being, hope, food security) to determine the relationships between mental health and food-related variables. Importantly, findings from our study show that survivors experience low food security at higher rates (53.8%) than the U.S. national average (11.5%). Additionally, the proportion of survivors in our sample who are receiving some form of food aid and remain food insecure is high (26.9%), leading to questions about the adequacy of food aid. Finally, our results underpin the relationship between food security and mental health for survivors, as low food security is positively correlated with depression, PTSD, disability, trouble concentrating, lack of hope and decreased well-being. These findings have implications for how we evaluate food security and the role it plays in well-being for survivors.",domestic violence; hunger; mental health; nutrition; women.
2192,Genetic structure and relationships of 16 Asian and European cattle populations using DigiTag2 assay,"Riku Yonesaka,Shinji Sasazaki,Hiroshi Yasue,Satoru Niwata,Yousuke Inayoshi,Fumio Mukai,Hideyuki Mannen,Riku Yonesaka,Shinji Sasazaki,Hiroshi Yasue,Satoru Niwata,Yousuke Inayoshi,Fumio Mukai,Hideyuki Mannen","In this study, we genotyped 117 autosomal single nucleotide polymorphisms using a DigiTag2 assay to assess the genetic diversity, structure and relationships of 16 Eurasian cattle populations, including nine cattle breeds and seven native cattle. Phylogenetic and principal component analyses showed that Bos taurus and Bos indicus populations were clearly distinguished, whereas Japanese Shorthorn and Japanese Polled clustered with European populations. Furthermore, STRUCTURE analysis demonstrated the distinct separation between Bos taurus and Bos indicus (K=2), and between European and Asian populations (K=3). In addition, Japanese Holstein exhibited an admixture pattern with Asian and European cattle (K=3-5). Mongolian (K=13-16) and Japanese Black (K=14-16) populations exhibited admixture patterns with different ancestries. Bos indicus populations exhibited a uniform genetic structure at K=2-11, thereby suggesting that there are close genetic relationships among Bos indicus populations. However, the Bhutan and Bangladesh populations formed a cluster distinct from the other Bos indicus populations at K=12-16. In conclusion, our study could sufficiently explain the genetic construction of Asian cattle populations, including: (i) the close genetic relationships among Bos indicus populations; (ii) the genetic influences of European breeds on Japanese breeds; (iii) the genetic admixture in Japanese Holstein, Mongolian and Japanese Black cattle; and (iv) the genetic subpopulations in Southeast Asia.",Asia; DigiTag2 assay; SNP; cattle; genetic structure.
2193,Multimedia data mining: state of the art and challenges,"Bhatt, Chidansh Amitkumar; Kankanhalli, Mohan S.","Advances in multimedia data acquisition and storage technology have led to the growth of very large multimedia databases. Analyzing this huge amount of multimedia data to discover useful knowledge is a challenging problem. This challenge has opened the opportunity for research in Multimedia Data Mining (MDM). Multimedia data mining can be defined as the process of finding interesting patterns from media data such as audio, video, image and text that are not ordinarily accessible by basic queries and associated results. The motivation for doing MDM is to use the discovered patterns to improve decision making. MDM has therefore attracted significant research efforts in developing methods and tools to organize, manage, search and perform domain specific tasks for data from domains such as surveillance, meetings, broadcast news, sports, archives, movies, medical data, as well as personal and online media collections. This paper presents a survey on the problems and solutions in Multimedia Data Mining, approached from the following angles: feature extraction, transformation and representation techniques, data mining techniques, and current multimedia data mining systems in various application domains. We discuss main aspects of feature extraction, transformation and representation techniques. These aspects are: level of feature extraction, feature fusion, features synchronization, feature correlation discovery and accurate representation of multimedia data. Comparison of MDM techniques with state of the art video processing, audio processing and image processing techniques is also provided. Similarly, we compare MDM techniques with the state of the art data mining techniques involving clustering, classification, sequence pattern mining, association rule mining and visualization. We review current multimedia data mining systems in detail, grouping them according to problem formulations and approaches. The review includes supervised and unsupervised discovery of events and actions from one or more continuous sequences. We also do a detailed analysis to understand what has been achieved and what are the remaining gaps where future research efforts could be focussed. We then conclude this survey with a look at open research directions.",Survey; Multimodal data mining; Probabilistic temporal multimedia data mining; Video mining; Audio mining; Image mining; Text mining
2194,An Effective Semantic Code Clone Detection Framework Using Pairwise Feature Fusion,"Sheneamer, Abdullah; Roy, Swarup; Kalita, Jugal","Code clones. In this work, we propose a novel detection framework using machine learning for automated detection of all four type of clones. The features extracted from a pair of code blocks are combined for possible detection of a clone with respect to a reference block. We use AST and PDG features of both code blocks to prepare labelled training samples after fusing the two feature vectors using three different alternatives. We use six state-of-the-art classification models including Deep Convolutional Neural Network to assess the prediction performance of our scheme. To access the effectiveness of our framework we use seven datasets and compare its performance with five state-of-the-art clone detectors. We also compare a large number of algorithms for code clone detection. Comparing the performance of a large number of machine learning techniques, ANN and non-ANN, using such features, and establishing that fusing of AST and PDG features gives competitive results using deep learning as well as boosted tree algorithms, we find that boosted tree algorithms like XGBoost are quite competitive in clone detection. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing clone detection methods in terms of prediction accuracy.",Cloning; Semantics; Feature extraction; Task analysis; Syntactics; Machine learning algorithms; Prediction algorithms; Machine learning; code clones; semantic clones; AST; PDG; features; deep learning; classification

This paper proposes sequential Bayesian methods for simultaneous detection, threshold-free delineation, and waveform estimation of P and T waves on a beat-to-beat basis. By contrast to state-of-the-art methods that process multiple-beat signal blocks, the proposed Bayesian methods account for beat-to-beat waveform variations by sequentially estimating the waveforms for each beat. Our methods are based on Bayesian signal models that take into account previous beats as prior information. To estimate the unknown parameters of these Bayesian models, we first propose a block Gibbs sampler that exhibits fast convergence in spite of the strong local dependencies in the ECG signal. Then, in order to take into account all the information contained in the past rather than considering only one previous beat, a sequential Monte Carlo method is presented, with a marginalized particle filter that efficiently estimates the unknown parameters of the dynamic model. Both methods are evaluated on the annotated QT database and observed to achieve significant improvements in detection rate and delineation accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods, thus providing promising approaches for sequential P and T wave analysis.

2197,Spectral brain signatures of aesthetic natural perception in the α and β frequency bands,"Daniel Kaiser,Daniel Kaiser","During our everyday lives, visual beauty is often conveyed by sustained and dynamic visual stimulation, such as when we walk through an enchanting forest or watch our pets playing. Here, I devised an MEG experiment that mimics such situations: participants viewed 8 s videos of everyday situations and rated their beauty. Using multivariate analysis, I linked aesthetic ratings to 1) sustained MEG broadband responses and 2) spectral MEG responses in the α and β frequency bands. These effects were not accounted for by a set of high- and low-level visual descriptors of the videos, suggesting that they are genuinely related to aesthetic perception. My findings provide the first characterization of spectral brain signatures linked to aesthetic experiences in the real world.NEW & NOTEWORTHY In the real world, aesthetic experiences arise from complex and dynamic inputs. This study shows that such aesthetic experiences are represented in a spectral neural code: cortical α and β activity track our judgments of the aesthetic appearance of natural videos, providing a new starting point for studying the neural correlates of beauty through rhythmic brain activity.",MEG; alpha/beta activity; brain rhythms; natural vision; neuroaesthetics.

It can turn the negative impacts of demolition, including diverting valuable resources from the congested landfill into beneficial use through reuse and recycling. However, the feasibility of deconstruction has placed a massive limitation on the implementation of deconstruction. This research carried out a systematic literature review of 35 academic and 3 non-academic pieces of literature to develop a construct-based deconstructability framework. This framework - built around technical, economic, legal, operational, schedule and social construct - describes the condition under which deconstruction is likely to work and drivers influencing deconstructability. A total of 44 drivers influencing deconstructability were established and ranked from which design and building technology, cost including expense and revenues from the resale, supply and demand of the recovered component and material, the schedule for the deconstruction were identified as most influential. However, every identified driver should be considered during the deconstructability assessment of a building.",Building deconstruction; circular economy; conceptual framework; deconstructability; sustainable end-of-life.

In our study, we planned to investigate the relationship between carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT), OP, and bone turnover parameters in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM2) of both sexes. Materials and Methods: A total of 69 patients and 40 healthy volunteers with chronic diseases such as DM2, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and OP. Group 1 had 27 patients with DM2 and OP, group 2 had 42 patients with DM2 and no OP, and group 3 had 40 healthy volunteers without DM2 and OP. Results: In the control group, CIMT was measured lower than the patients with DM2 (0.8 + 0.1 and 1.1 + 0.3, P < 0.001, respectively). Femur T score and lumbar T score values of patients with DM2 were lower than the control group (-0.48 + 1.1 and 0.7 + 0.6, P < 0.001, and -1.3 + 1.5 and 0.6 + 0.5, P < 0.001, respectively). Bone turnover markers in DM2 compared to the control group (C-terminal telopeptide of type 1 collagen: 240.9 ± 211.1 and 606.5 ± 200.8, P < 0.001; bone-specific alkaline phosphatase: 47.9 ± 15.5 and 431.5 ± 140, P < 0.001; and osteocalcin: 13.2 ± 5.0 and 19.7 ± 9.2, P < 0.001, respectively) were lower. Patients with femoral region (TSF) T score and lumbar region (TSL) T score below -2.5 were found to have higher CIMT values than those without (1.2 ± 0.23 mm and 0.9 ± 0.23 mm, P = 0.006, and 1.1 ± 0.28 mm and 0.95 ± 0.21 mm, P = 0.003, respectively). In linear regression analysis, age (β = 0.01, P < 0.001), OP (β = 0.166, P = 0.001), and DDM2 (β = 0.222, P = 0.04) were found to be effective on CIMT, while DM2 (β) = -0.754, P < 0.001), CIMT (β = -0.258, P = 0.021), body mass index (β = 0.355, P = 0.028), and age (β = -0.229, P = 0.029) were found to be independent factors on TSF. Conclusion: Bone turnover and bone mineral density are decreased in DM2 patients. In addition, subclinical atherosclerosis is more common in DM2 patients. Findings suggest that there is a relationship between subclinical atherosclerosis and OP due to metabolic factors other than age.",bone turnover; osteoporosis; subclinical atherosclerosis.
2201,Ranavirus infection-induced avoidance behaviour in wood frog juveniles: do amphibians socially distance?,"E H Le Sage,M Diamond,E J Crespi,E H Le Sage,M Diamond,E J Crespi","Hosts may limit exposure to pathogens through changes in behaviour, such as avoiding infected individuals or contaminated areas. Here, we tested for a behavioural response to ranavirus infection in juvenile wood frogs (Rana sylvatica) because the majority of dispersal between populations occurs during this life stage. We hypothesized that if infections are transmissible and detectable at this life stage, then susceptibles would display avoidance behaviours when introduced to an infected conspecific. Despite no apparent signs of infection, we observed a greater distance between susceptible-infected pairs, compared to pairs of either two infected or two susceptible animals. Further, distances between susceptible-infected pairs were positively related to the infection intensity of the focal exposed frog, suggesting the cue to avoid infected conspecifics may become more detectable with more intense infections. Although we did not quantify whether the transmission was affected by their distancing, our findings suggest that juvenile frogs have the potential to reduce terrestrial transmission of ranaviruses through avoidance behaviours.",behavioural immunity; behavioural resistance; host–pathogen interaction; pathogen avoidance; social distancing; transmission.

But the efficiency of EDC signal amplification is not enough high because only one single strand can be produced in each cycle of the typical EDC system. In this work, we proposed one strategy to improve the amplification efficiency of EDC-based biosensing. In this strategy, two signal strands were produced in one cycle. The G-triplex (G3)-forming sequence was used as signal strand, and the G3/thioflavin T (G3/ThT) was used as label-free fluorescence reporter in this EDC-based biosensing. The detection limit of this method was estimated to be 3.4 pM for target DNA, which was about 10 times lower than that of the conventional EDC method. Furthermore, the response time was shortened from more than 1 h-0.5 h. In a word, one enzyme-free and label-free EDC strategy was proposed to construct an efficient nucleic acid biosensing platform.",Entropy-driven circuits; Fluorescence; G-triplex/ThT; Label-free.

2205,TRACE: A Topological Graph Representation for Automatic Sulcal Curve Extraction,"Lyu, Ilwoo; Kim, Sun Hyung; Woodward, Neil D.; Styner, Martin A.; Landman, Bennett A.","A proper geometric representation of the cortical regions is a fundamental task for cortical shape analysis and landmark extraction. However, a significant challenge has arisen due to the highly variable, convoluted cortical folding patterns. In this paper, we propose a novel topological graph representation for automatic sulcal curve extraction (TRACE). In practice, the reconstructed surface suffers from noise influences introduced during image acquisition/surface reconstruction. In the presence of noise on the surface, TRACE determines stable sulcal fundic regions by employing the line simplification method that prevents the sulcal folding pattern from being significantly smoothed out. The sulcal curves are then traced over the connected graph in the determined regions by the Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm. For validation, we used the state-of-the-art surface reconstruction pipelines on a reproducibility data set. The experimental results showed higher reproducibility and robustness to noise in TRACE than the existing method (Li et al. 2010) with over 20% relative improvement in error for both surface reconstruction pipelines. In addition, the extracted sulcal curves by TRACE were well-aligned with manually delineated primary sulcal curves. We also provided a choice of parameters to control quality of the extracted sulcal curves and showed the influences of the parameter selection on the resulting curves.",Cortical surface; line simplification; shortest path; sulcal curve; topological graph; valley detection

Contemporary antifungal therapies rely heavily on three classes of antifungal drugs, and to date, no fungal vaccine is in clinical use for invasive mycosis. A major gap in knowledge related to fungal vaccine development is identifying lasting mechanisms of protective immunity in immunocompromised individuals. Recent studies in Cryptococcus neoformans and now Aspergillus fumigatus have identified a fungal sterylglucosidase essential for pathogenesis and virulence in murine models of mycoses. Fungal strains deficient in this sterylglucosidase can surprisingly also induce substantial immune-mediated protection against subsequent challenge with wild-type strains in multiple immunocompromised murine models of mycoses.

2208,Algorithm and VLSI Architecture Design of Low-Power SPIHT Decoder for mHealth Applications,"Hsieh, Jui-Hung; Shih, Meng-Ju; Huang, Xin-Hao","A real-time cost and power-efficient (CPE) set partitioning in hierarchical trees (SPIHT) decoder design with low hardware complexity and low-power dissipation is introduced in one-dimension (1-D) wavelet-based quality-assured electrocardiograph (ECG) compression systems for mobile health (mHealth) applications. However, current SPIHT coding architectures are designed for image/video processing. These architectures require a large amount of memory as well as complicated sorting algorithms, which both require time-consuming tasks and are unsuitable for mobile ECG applications. Based on our previously modified SPIHT coding work, which used flags and check bits to reduce memory requirements and coding complexity by merging three search processes into one step. Therefore, to achieve the real-time design goal for mobile ECG applications, in this paper, we first introduce a hardware-oriented SPIHT decoding algorithm that is suitable for decoding the previously presented SPIHT codingwork. Accordingly, an appropriate low-power hardware architecture is developed to implement a real-time high-performance and low-cost SPIHT VLSI design for our proposed decoder algorithm, which is appropriate for mobile ECG applications. Using the distinct ECG signals in the MIT-BIH arrhythmia database (sampling rate of 360 Hz), the final simulation and VLSI implementation results reveal that the proposed CPE SPIHT decoder design outperforms the state-of-the-art designs in terms of the average decoding time, the decoding quality, the VLSI speed, and the power consumption.

In this paper, we take a graph signal processing perspective and model multi-site photovoltaic (PV) production time series as signals on a graph to capture their spatio-temporal dependencies and achieve higher spatial and temporal resolution forecasts. We present two novel graph neural network models for deterministic multi-site PV forecasting dubbed the graph-convolutional long short term memory (GCLSTM) and the graph-convolutional transformer (GCTrafo) models. These methods rely solely on production data and exploit the intuition that PV systems provide a dense network of virtual weather stations. The proposed methods were evaluated in two data sets for an entire year: 1) production data from 304 real PV systems, and 2) simulated production of 1000 PV systems, both distributed over Switzerland. The proposed models outperform state-of-the-art multi-site forecasting methods for prediction horizons of six hours ahead. Furthermore, the proposed models outperform state-of-the-art single-site methods with NWP as inputs on horizons up to four hours ahead.",Forecasting; Convolution; Predictive models; Production; Weather forecasting; Correlation; Data models; Photovoltaic systems; forecasting; machine learning; graph signal processing; graph neural networks

Traditionally, the lack of a visible arc has been the defining quality of good commutation; hence, the term ""black."" The knowledge gap and relatively high-level physical science involved with commutation have led to an art known as ""black magic"" for achieving the invisible-arc condition [5], [6].

Aiming to progress beyond the state-of-the-art zero-shot event detection, we propose a new zero-shot event detection approach, which exploits the semantic correlation between an event and concepts. Based on the concept detectors pre-trained from external sources, our method learns the semantic correlation from the concept vocabulary and emphasizes on the most related concepts for the zero-shot event detection. Particularly, a novel Event-Adaptive Concept Integration algorithm is introduced to estimate the effectiveness of semantically related concepts by assigning different weights to them. As opposed to assigning weights by an invariable strategy, we compute the weights of concepts using the area under score curve. The assigned weights are incorporated into the confidence score vector statistically to better characterize the event-concept correlation. Our algorithm is proved to be able to harness the related concepts discriminatively tailored for a target event. Extensive experiments are conducted on the challenging TRECVID event video datasets, which demonstrate the advantage of our approach over the state-of-the-art methods. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

TADs insulate gene promoters from enhancers that occupy neighboring TADs. Chromosomal rearrangements that disrupt TAD structure can generate new regulatory interactions between enhancers and promoters that were once separated into different TADs, which might lead to new gene expression patterns. On the one hand, TAD rearrangements are known to cause deleterious phenotypes, but, on the other hand, rearrangements can also create novel expression patterns that may be selected during evolution because they generate advantageous phenotypes. Here, we review recent studies that explore the effects of chromosomal rearrangements and genetic perturbations on TAD structure and gene regulation in the context of development and evolution. We discuss the possible contribution of evolutionary breakpoints (EBRs) that affect TAD structure to the evolution of gene regulation and the phenotype.",3D genome architecture; TAD; chromosomal rearrangement; enhancer; gene expression; phenotypic evolution.
2214,Line Detection as an Inverse Problem: Application to Lung Ultrasound Imaging,"Anantrasirichai, Nantheera; Hayes, Wesley; Allinovi, Marco; Bull, David; Achim, Alin","This paper presents a novel method for line restoration in speckle images. We address this as a sparse estimation problem using both convex and non-convex optimization techniques based on the Radon transform and sparsity regularization. This breaks into subproblems, which are solved using the alternating direction method of multipliers, thereby achieving line detection and deconvolution simultaneously. We include an additional deblurring step in the Radon domain via a total variation blind deconvolution to enhance line visualization and to improve line recognition. We evaluate our approach on a real clinical application: the identification of B-lines in lung ultrasound images. Thus, an automatic B-line identification method is proposed, using a simple local maxima technique in the Radon transform domain, associated with known clinical definitions of line artefacts. Using all initially detected lines as a starting point, our approach then differentiates between B-lines and other lines of no clinical significance, including Z-lines and A-lines. We evaluated our techniques using as ground truth lines identified visually by clinical experts. The proposed approach achieves the best B-line detection performance as measured by the F score when a non-convex l(p) regularization is employed for both line detection and deconvolution. The F scores as well as the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves show that the proposed approach outperforms the state-of-the-art methods with improvements in B-line detection performance of 54%, 40%, and 33% for F-0.5, F-1, and F-2, respectively, and of 24% based on ROC curve evaluations.",Line detection; deconvolution; image restoration; ultrasound; inverse problem; ADMM; sparsity regularisation
2215,Time and Memory Efficient Online Piecewise Linear Approximation of Sensor Signals,"Gruetzmacher, Florian; Beichler, Benjamin; Hein, Albert; Kirste, Thomas; Haubelt, Christian","Piecewise linear approximation of sensor signals is a well-known technique in the fields of Data Mining and Activity Recognition. In this context, several algorithms have been developed, some of them with the purpose to be performed on resource constrained microcontroller architectures of wireless sensor nodes. While microcontrollers are usually constrained in computational power and memory resources, all state-of-the-art piecewise linear approximation techniques either need to buffer sensor data or have an execution time depending on the segment's length. In the paper at hand, we propose a novel piecewise linear approximation algorithm, with a constant computational complexity as well as a constant memory complexity. Our proposed algorithm's worst-case execution time is one to three orders of magnitude smaller and its average execution time is three to seventy times smaller compared to the state-of-the-art Piecewise Linear Approximation (PLA) algorithms in our experiments. In our evaluations, we show that our algorithm is time and memory efficient without sacrificing the approximation quality compared to other state-of-the-art piecewise linear approximation techniques, while providing a maximum error guarantee per segment, a small parameter space of only one parameter, and a maximum latency of one sample period plus its worst-case execution time.",piecewise linear approximation; segmentation; sensor data abstraction; sensor signal compression; CPLR; wireless sensor networks; embedded sensor processing
2216,The complete mitochondrial genome of Chinese land snail Aegista aubryana (Gastropoda: Pulmonata: Bradybaenidae),"Xue Yang,Guang-Long Xie,Xiao-Ping Wu,Shan Ouyang,Xue Yang,Guang-Long Xie,Xiao-Ping Wu,Shan Ouyang","Aegista aubryana is an endemic land snail in China. The complete mitochondrial genome of A. aubryana was first determined using long PCR reactions and primer walking method (accession number KT192071). The genome has a length of 14 238 bp, containing 37 typical mitochondrial genes (13 protein-coding genes, 22 tRNA genes and 2 rRNA genes). The base composition of the whole heavy strand is A 31.32%, T 37.86%, C 14.46% and G 16.36%. The results of phylogenetic analyses showed that the A. aubryana is most closely related to Mastigeulota kiangsinensis.

2217,Load-Oriented Order Release (LOOR) revisited: bringing it back to the state of the art,"Yan, Haoyun; Stevenson, Mark; Hendry, Linda C.; Land, Martin J.","In the workload control literature, the Load-Oriented Order Release (LOOR) approach has been neglected since its robustness was questioned at the end of the 1990s. This paper revisits LOOR and evaluates whether its performance can be improved in two ways. First, an intermediate pull release mechanism is added to avoid starvation between periodic release events. This mechanism was recently shown to be effective at improving the performance of a state-of-the-art release method known as LUMS COR. Second, an integer linear programming model is used to manage the trade-off between the timing and load balancing functions of order release. The two refinements are assessed using simulations of different shop configurations, which allow us to evaluate robustness. Results demonstrate that the refinements contribute to improving the performance of LOOR such that it can even outperform LUMS COR. Perhaps counter-intuitively, putting more emphasis on load balancing than on the urgency of individual orders is shown to lead to a lower percentage of tardy orders. Overall, the improvements mean that concerns about LOOR's robustness are no longer valid - it now appears suitable for a wide range of shops found in practice.",Workload control (WLC); intermediate pull release; load balancing; job shop; simulation
2218,Video Extrapolation Method Based on Time-Varying Energy Optimization and CIP,"Sakaino, Hidetomo","Video extrapolation/prediction methods are often used to synthesize new videos from images. For fluid-like images and dynamic textures as well as moving rigid objects, most state-of-the-art video extrapolation methods use non-physics-based models that learn orthogonal bases from a number of images but at high computation cost. Unfortunately, data truncation can cause image degradation, i.e., blur, artifact, and insufficient motion changes. To extrapolate videos that more strictly follow physical rules, this paper proposes a physics-based method that needs only a few images and is truncation-free. We utilize physics-based equations with image intensity and velocity: optical flow, Navier-Stokes, continuity, and advection equations. These allow us to use partial difference equations to deal with the local image feature changes. Image degradation during extrapolation is minimized by updating model parameters, where a novel time-varying energy balancer model that uses energy based image features, i.e., texture, velocity, and edge. Moreover, the advection equation is discretized by high-order constrained interpolation profile for lower quantization error than can be achieved by the previous finite difference method in long-term videos. Experiments show that the proposed energy based video extrapolation method outperforms the state-of-the-art video extrapolation methods in terms of image quality and computation cost.",Video; image features; optical flow; physics; energy; time-varying; optimization; CIP; image quality
2219,Perspectives of Hybrid Performing Arts Education in the Post-Pandemic Era: An Empirical Study in Hong Kong,"Li, Zihao (Michael); Li, Qingyun; Han, Jie; Zhang, Zhongyang","While the COVID-19 pandemic has been raging across the continents, performing arts educators have unlearned and adjusted their pedagogies in course delivery to surmount the challenges caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Subject to the COVID-19 pandemic situation easing in Hong Kong and around the world, the whole education sector seems to be bouncing back to normal gradually. Meanwhile, there are effective lessons and insights to be learned from the hybrid pedagogy during the pandemic, which could further benefit the new normal period (post-pandemic) of performing arts education. To examine the current practice of digital learning among students and faculty (attitudes towards hybrid, online, and face-to-face learning and preferences about learning mode for professional development/training workshops), this empirical study looks at 408 students and 17 faculty members at a leading performing arts institute in Hong Kong. This study locates the key issues for performing arts educators regarding online/hybrid teaching and learning. It presents lessons and insights for quality insurance and improvement. Findings can inform the future development of digital teaching and learning for the performing arts as well as for other practice-based subjects.",performing arts education; online learning; hybrid learning; future learning; digital teaching

In this paper, we explore DNNs to push the limit for branch prediction. We treat branch prediction as a classification problem and employ both deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs), ranging from LeNet to ResNet-50, and deep belief network (DBN) for branch prediction. We compare the effectiveness of DNNs with the state-of-the-art branch predictors, including the perceptron, our prior work, Multi-poTAGE+SC, and MTAGE+SC branch predictors. The last two are the most recent winners of championship branch prediction (CBP) contests. Several interesting observations emerged from our study. First, for branch prediction, the DNNs outperform the perceptron model as high as 60-80%. Second, we analyze the impact of the depth of CNNs (i.e., number of convolutional layers and pooling layers) on the misprediction rates. The results confirm that deeper CNN structures can lead to lower misprediction rates. Third, the DBN could outperform our prior work, but not outperform the state-of-the-art TAGE-like branch predictor; the ResNet-50 could not only outperform our prior work, but also the Multi-poTAGE+SC and MTAGE+SC.",History; Neural networks; Machine learning; Convolution; Predictive models; Prediction algorithms; Correlation; Branch prediction; CNN; deep learning; VGG; ResNet

2223,Informativity renders a referent more accessible: Evidence from eyetracking,"Hossein Karimi,Fernanda Ferreira,Hossein Karimi,Fernanda Ferreira","The amount of information attached to a noun phrase (henceforth, NP) has been shown to enhance accessibility and increase pronominal reference in language production. However, both the effect of information quantity on the comprehension of ambiguous pronouns and the time course of any informativity effect have been left unexplored. In two eyetracking experiments, we investigated how additional information on the part of NP referents influenced the resolution of following ambiguous pronouns. The results of the first experiment revealed an informativity effect, with more looks to the informationally richer referent than to the competitor. However, the effect of additional information emerged late in time when the referent was the object of the verb. The second experiment replicated the results of the first and also showed that, consistent with the online results, an ambiguous pronoun is interpreted as referring to the informationally richer NP in an offline, explicit pronoun resolution task. The results lend support to theories of language processing that assume that explicit information increases the accessibility of the associated concept, in contrast to approaches that assume that accessibility is associated with givenness.",Informativity; NP length; NP position; Pronoun resolution; Time course.

Here, we report a significant application of this library for discovering essential genes for heart rhythm disorders such as sick sinus syndrome (SSS). SSS is a group of heart rhythm disorders caused by malfunction of the sinus node, the heart's primary pacemaker. Partially owing to its aging-associated phenotypic manifestation and low expressivity, molecular mechanisms of SSS remain difficult to decipher. From 609 GBT lines screened, we generated a collection of 35 zebrafish insertional cardiac (ZIC) mutants in which each mutant traps a gene with cardiac expression. We further employed electrocardiographic measurements to screen these 35 ZIC lines and identified three GBT mutants with SSS-like phenotypes. More detailed functional studies on one of the arrhythmogenic mutants, GBT411, in both zebrafish and mouse models unveiled Dnajb6 as a novel SSS causative gene with a unique expression pattern within the subpopulation of sinus node pacemaker cells that partially overlaps with the expression of hyperpolarization activated cyclic nucleotide gated channel 4 (HCN4), supporting heterogeneity of the cardiac pacemaker cells.",Dnajb6; electrocardiogram; genetic diseases; genetics; genomics; sick sinus syndrome; sinus arrest; zebrafish.
2227,Semi-Supervised Nonlinear Distance Metric Learning via Forests of Max-Margin Cluster Hierarchies,"Johnson, David M.; Xiong, Caiming; Corso, Jason J.","Metric learning is a key problem for many data mining and machine learning applications, and has long been dominated by Mahalanobis methods. Recent advances in nonlinear metric learning have demonstrated the potential power of non-Mahalanobis distance functions, particularly tree-based functions. We propose a novel nonlinear metric learning method that uses an iterative, hierarchical variant of semi-supervised max-margin clustering to construct a forest of cluster hierarchies, where each individual hierarchy can be interpreted as a weak metric over the data. By introducing randomness during hierarchy training and combining the output of many of the resulting semi-random weak hierarchy metrics, we can obtain a powerful and robust nonlinear metric model. This method has two primary contributions: first, it is semi-supervised, incorporating information from both constrained and unconstrained points. Second, we take a relaxed approach to constraint satisfaction, allowing the method to satisfy different subsets of the constraints at different levels of the hierarchy rather than attempting to simultaneously satisfy all of them. This leads to a more robust learning algorithm. We compare our method to a number of state-of-the-art benchmarks on k-nearest neighbor classification, large-scale image retrieval and semi-supervised clustering problems, and find that our algorithm yields results comparable or superior to the state-of-the-art.",Clustering; classification; and association rules; data mining; image/video retrieval; machine learning; similarity measures

Fever creates an adverse environment for many bacteria, leading to reduced bacterial proliferation; however, most pathogenic bacteria can tolerate higher temperatures. CpxAR is a two-component regulation system, ubiquitous among Gram-negative bacteria, which senses and responds to envelope alterations that are mostly associated with protein misfolding in the periplasm. Our previous study showed that CpxAR is necessary for the optimal growth of Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae under heat stress. Here, we showed that mutation of the type IV pilin gene apfA rescued the growth defect of the cpxAR deletion strain under heat stress. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analyses revealed that 265 genes were differentially expressed in the ΔcpxAR strains grown at 42°C, including genes involved in type IV pilus biosynthesis. We also demonstrated direct binding of the CpxR protein to the promoter of the apf operon by an electrophoretic mobility shift assay and identified the binding site by a DNase I footprinting assay. In conclusion, our results revealed the important role of CpxAR in A. pleuropneumoniae resistance to heat stress by directly suppressing the expression of ApfA. IMPORTANCE Heat acts as a danger signal for pathogens, especially those infecting mammalian hosts in whom fever indicates infection. However, some bacteria have evolved exquisite mechanisms to survive under heat stress. Studying the mechanism of resistance to heat stress is crucial to understanding the pathogenesis of A. pleuropneumoniae during the acute stage of infection. Our study revealed that CpxAR plays an important role in A. pleuropneumoniae resistance to heat stress by directly suppressing expression of the type IV pilin protein ApfA.",Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae; CpxAR; TCS; heat stress; type IV pilus.
2230,A Hybrid Deep Model for Recognizing Arabic Handwritten Characters,"Alrobah, Naseem; Albahli, Saleh","Handwriting recognition for computer systems has been in research for a long time, with different researchers having an extensive variety of methods at their disposal. The problem is that most of these experiments are done in English, as it is the most spoken language in the world. But other languages such as Arabic, Mandarin, Spanish, French, and Russian also need research done on them since there are millions of people who speak them. In this work, recognizing and developing Arabic handwritten characters is proposed by cleaning the state-of-the-art Arabic dataset called Hijaa, developing Conventional Neural Network (CNN) with a hybrid model using Support Vector Machine (SVM) and eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) classifiers. The CNN is used for feature extraction of the Arabic character images, which are then passed on to the Machine Learning classifiers. A recognition rate of up to 96.3% for 29classes is achieved, far surpassing the already state-of-the-art results of the Hijaa dataset.",Character recognition; Support vector machines; Handwriting recognition; Training; Feature extraction; Task analysis; Testing; Convolutional neural network; machine learning; backpropagation; Arabic character recognition; Hijja dataset; optimizers

Results: Following on better microbiological, quality controls of dialysis water and improvement of procedures and equipment, a drastic improvement of microbiological water quality was observed in a total of 945 samples. The main aim was to introduce the use of microbiological culture methods as recommended by the most important guidelines. The microbiological results obtained have led to a progressive refining of controls and introduction of new materials and equipment, including two-stage osmosis and piping distribution rings featuring a greater capacity to prevent biofilm adhesion. The actions undertaken have resulted in unexpected quality improvements.

More importantly, the peptide Tat-CX3CL1 (comprising amino acids 357-395 of CX3CL1) disrupts the interaction between postsynaptic density-93 and CX3CL1, reducing neurological impairment and exerting a protective effect in the context of acute ischemic stroke. However, the mechanism underlying these effects remains unclear. In the current study, we found that the pro-inflammatory M1 phenotype increased and the anti-inflammatory M2 phenotype decreased at different time points. The M1 phenotype increased at 6 hours after stroke and peaked at 24 hours after perfusion, whereas the M2 phenotype decreased at 6 and 24 hours following reperfusion. We found that the peptide Tat-CX3CL1 (357-395aa) facilitates microglial polarization from M1 to M2 by reducing the production of soluble CX3CL1. Furthermore, the a disintegrin and metalloprotease domain 17 (ADAM17) inhibitor GW280264x, which inhibits metalloprotease activity and prevents CX3CL1 from being sheared into its soluble form, facilitated microglial polarization from M1 to M2 by inhibiting soluble CX3CL1 formation. Additionally, Tat-CX3CL1 (357-395aa) attenuated long-term cognitive deficits and improved white matter integrity as determined by the Morris water maze test at 31-34 days following surgery and immunofluorescence staining at 35 days after stroke, respectively. In conclusion, Tat-CX3CL1 (357-395aa) facilitates functional recovery after ischemic stroke by promoting microglial polarization from M1 to M2. Therefore, the Tat-CX3CL1 (357-395aa) is a potential therapeutic agent for ischemic stroke.",C X3 C motif chemokine ligand 1; GW280264x; Tat-CX3CL1 (357– 395aa); a disintegrin and metalloprotease domain 17; cerebral ischemia/reperfusion; microglia; neuroinflammation; postsynaptic density-93.

The transfer learning technique based on pre-trained networks, which is widely used in deep learning for image classification, is not directly applicable to point clouds, because pre-trained networks trained by a large number of samples from multiple sources are not available. To solve this problem, we design a framework incorporating a state-of-the-art deep learning network, i.e. VoxNet, and propose an extended Multiclass TrAdaBoost algorithm, which can be trained with complementary training samples from other source datasets to improve the classification accuracy in the target domain. In this framework, we first train the VoxNet model with the combined dataset and extract the feature vectors from the fully connected layer, and then use these to train the Multiclass TrAdaBoost.

A distinctive feature of cortico-cerebellar loops that has been demonstrated in the animal work is a topographic organization that is preserved across its corticopontine, pontocerebellar, and cerebello-thalmo-cortical segments. Here we used tractography derived from diffusion imaging data to characterize the connections between the pons and the individual lobules of the cerebellum and generate a parcellation of the pons and middle cerebellar peduncle based on the pattern of connectivity. We identified a rostral to caudal gradient in the pons, similar to that observed in the animal work, such that rostral regions were preferentially connected to cerebellar lobules involved in non-motor, and caudal regions with motor regions. These findings advance our fundamental understanding of the cerebellum, and the parcellations we generated provide context for future research into the pontocerebellar tract's involvement in health and disease.",Cerebellum; Connectivity; Diffusion MRI; Pons; Pontocerebellar.

Their propagation success is however hindered by a combination of mechanisms such as mutations, selection, and their epigenetic silencing by the host genome. As a result, most copies of TEs in a given genome are dead relics: their sequence is too degenerated to allow any transposition. Nevertheless, these TE relics often, but not always, remain epigenetically silenced, and if not to prevent transposition anymore, one can wonder the reason for this phenomenon. The mere self-perpetuating loop inherent to epigenetic silencing could alone explain that even when inactive, TE copies remain silenced. Beyond this process, nevertheless, antagonistic selective forces are likely to act on TE relic silencing. Especially, without the benefit of preventing transposition, TE relic silencing may prove deleterious to the host fitness, suggesting that the maintenance of TE relic silencing is the result of a fine, and perhaps case-by-case, evolutionary trade-off between beneficial and deleterious effects. Ultimately, the release of TE relics silencing may provide a 'safe' ground for adaptive epimutations to arise. In this review, we provide an overview of these questions in both plants and animals.",Transposable elements; adaptive epimutations; epigenetic silencing; gene regulation; host genome defence; recombination; transposable elements relics.

To date, the HSI datasets available for image classification are relatively small to train deep learning methods. This study proposes a deep 3D/2D genome graph-based network (abbreviated as HybridGBN-SR) that is computationally efficient and not prone to overfitting even with extremely few training sample data. At the feature extraction level, the HybridGBN-SR utilizes the three-dimensional (3D) and two-dimensional (2D) Genoblocks trained using very few samples while improving HSI classification accuracy. The design of a Genoblock is based on a biological genome graph. From the experimental results, the study shows that our model achieves better classification accuracy than the compared state-of-the-art methods over the three publicly available HSI benchmarking datasets such as the Indian Pines (IP), the University of Pavia (UP), and the Salinas Scene (SA). For instance, using only 5% labeled data for training in IP, and 1% in UP and SA, the overall classification accuracy of the proposed HybridGBN-SR is 97.42%, 97.85%, and 99.34%, respectively, which is better than the compared state-of-the-art methods.",convolutional neural networks; genome graph; hyperspectral image classification; remote sensing; remote sensing image classification; residual learning; spectral-spatial features

The test results show that the failure mode and CERR of the bonded structure are closely related to the bonding materials, and three failure modes, i.e., the cohesive failure, the interface failure and the mixed-mode failure are identified on the bonding surface. The finite element method is used to simulate the interface debonding behavior of the DCB test specimens, and the influence of material randomness on the interface failure is introduced. A XFEM/CZM coupled approach is proposed to model the crack migration phenomena. The predicted results have a good agreement with the experimental results.",Bonded structure; Finite element method; Interface failure mode; Material randomness.
2245,Utilization of crude paper industry effluent for Polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) production,"Tyagi, Priyam; Sharma, Aarti","Paper industry generates a large amount of effluent which contains unused organic carbon from the raw materials used. Utilization of the unused carbon may lead to remediation of the effluent by lowering the BOD. Polyhydroxyalkanoates are microbial polymers which accumulate in various bacteria in carbon rich conditions. The present study is focused on the utilization of untreated crude paper industry effluent (PIE) as a substrate for Polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA) production to utilize the unused carbon and develop a feasible production process. To achieve this, indigenous PHA-producing bacterial strains were screened for their ability to utilize different concentrations of PIE as a substrate. One of the isolates, ART_41, was able to utilize different concentrations of PIE for growth. ART_41 was characterized as a Gram-negative strain belonging to Ancylobacter sp. by 16s rRNA sequencing. Maximum PHA production (41.7%) was achieved when using 30% PIE. FTIR and DSC-TGA analysis validated the extracted polymer as Poly-3-hydroxybutyrate (PHB). Thus, this study concludes that crude paper industry effluent could be utilized as a substrate when the correct bacterial strain is employed; allowing sustainable PHA production.

Precise head motion registration is crucial for accurate motion correction (MC) in PET imaging. State-of-the-art tracking systems applied with PET brain imaging rely on markers attached to the patient's head. The marker attachment is the main weakness of these systems. A healthy volunteer participating in a cigarette smoking study to image dopamine release was scanned twice for 2 h with C-11-racolopride on the high resolution research tomograph (HRRT) PET scanner. Head motion was independently measured, with a commercial marker-based device and the proposed vision-based system. A list-mode event-by-event reconstruction algorithm using the detected motion was applied. A phantom study with hand-controlled continuous random motion was obtained. Motion was time-varying with long drift motions of up to 18 mm and regular step-wise motion of 1-6 mm. The evaluated measures were significantly better for motion-corrected images compared to no MC. The demonstrated system agreed with a commercial integrated system.

In order to explore the applicability of deep learning techniques in understanding art images beyond object recognition and classification, we employ convolutional neural networks (CNN) to predict scores related to three subjective aspects of human perception: aesthetic evaluation of the image, sentiment evoked by the image, and memorability of the image. For each concept, we evaluate several different CNN models trained on various natural image datasets and select the best performing model based on the qualitative results and the comparison with existing subjective ratings of artworks. Furthermore, we employ different decision tree-based machine learning models to analyze the relative importance of various image features related to the content, composition, and color in determining image aesthetics, visual sentiment, and memorability scores. Our findings suggest that content and image lighting have significant influence on aesthetics, in which color vividness and harmony strongly influence sentiment prediction, while object emphasis has a high impact on memorability. In addition, we explore the predicted aesthetic, sentiment, and memorability scores in the context of art history by analyzing their distribution in regard to different artistic styles, genres, artists, and centuries. The presented approach enables new ways of exploring fine art collections based on highly subjective aspects of art, as well as represents one step forward toward bridging the gap between traditional formal analysis and the computational analysis of fine art.",Convolutional neural networks; image aesthetics; image memorability; fine art; visual sentiment
2250,The Use of Online CB-ART Interventions in the Context of COVID-19: Enhancing Salutogenic Coping,"Segal-Engelchin, Dorit; Huss, Ephrat; Sarid, Orly","Community crises require the provision of short-term reflective intervention methods to help service users identify stressors, and access and intensify their adaptive coping. Here, we demonstrate the use of a single-session online cognitive behavioral- and art-based (CB-ART) intervention within the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. In this method, the individual draws three images: his/her COVID-19-related stress, his/her perceived resources, and an integration of stress and resources. This method provided a reflective space in which individuals could identify their experienced stressors, acknowledge their coping resources, and integrate these two elements within the context of the current pandemic. In this article, we use illustrative examples from a study implemented during the first national lockdown in Israel and present a tool that can be easily implemented by mental-health professionals in ongoing community crises. The aims of this intervention were to co-create knowledge with service users, access their self-defined needs and strengths, and enhance their coping by enabling them to view stress and coping as part of the salutogenic continuum.",online CB-ART intervention; COVID-19-related stress; coping resources; salutogenic continuum; mental health professionals
2251,The application of clustering analysis for the critical areas on TFT-LCD panel,"Hsieh, Kun-Lin","For thin film transistor-liquid crystal displays (TFT-LCD) factories in Taiwan, yield performance had become as an important competitiveness determinant during the competitive environment. As we known, the market for LCDs has grown at over 20% on average per annum and the downward pricing trend had also promoted LCD applications. However, only few studies were proposed to address the related issues for process analysis in TFT-LCD industry from the viewpoint of systems. Particularly, the defect status (i.e. abnormal position) on TFT-LCD panel may represent the clustering effect when there are many defect counts on it. Hence, performing the clustering analysis for those abnormal positions will be an important issue to be addressed in TFT-LCD process. In this study, we will propose an approach incorporating fuzzy adaptive resonance theory (Fuzzy ART) and stepwise regression techniques to achieve such process analysis. Besides, an illustrative case owing to TFT-LCD manufacturer at Tainan Science Park in Taiwan will be applied to verifying the rationality and feasibility of our proposed procedure.

2252,Application of preconditioned alternating direction method of multipliers in depth from focal stack,"Javidnia, Hossein; Corcoran, Peter","Postcapture refocusing effect in smartphone cameras is achievable using focal stacks. However, the accuracy of this effect is totally dependent on the combination of the depth layers in the stack. The accuracy of the extended depth of field effect in this application can be improved significantly by computing an accurate depth map, which has been an open issue for decades. To tackle this issue, a framework is proposed based on a preconditioned alternating direction method of multipliers for depth from the focal stack and synthetic defocus application. In addition to its ability to provide high structural accuracy, the optimization function of the proposed framework can, in fact, converge faster and better than state-of-the-art methods. The qualitative evaluation has been done on 21 sets of focal stacks and the optimization function has been compared against five other methods. Later, 10 light field image sets have been transformed into focal stacks for quantitative evaluation purposes. Preliminary results indicate that the proposed framework has a better performance in terms of structural accuracy and optimization in comparison to the current state-of-the-art methods.

2253,Plant-associate interactions and diversification across trophic levels,"Jeremy B Yoder,Albert Dang,Caitlin MacGregor,Mikhail Plaza,Jeremy B Yoder,Albert Dang,Caitlin MacGregor,Mikhail Plaza","Interactions between species are widely understood to have promoted the diversification of life on Earth, but how interactions spur the formation of new species remains unclear. Interacting species often become locally adapted to each other, but they may also be subject to shared dispersal limitations and environmental conditions. Moreover, theory predicts that different kinds of interactions have different effects on diversification. To better understand how species interactions promote diversification, we compiled population genetic studies of host plants and intimately associated herbivores, parasites, and mutualists. We used Bayesian multiple regressions and the BEDASSLE modeling framework to test whether host and associate population structures were correlated over and above the potentially confounding effects of geography and shared environmental variation. We found that associates' population structure often paralleled their hosts' population structure, and that this effect is robust to accounting for geographic distance and climate. Associate genetic structure was significantly explained by plant genetic structure somewhat more often in antagonistic interactions than in mutualistic ones. This aligns with a key prediction of coevolutionary theory that antagonistic interactions promote diversity through local adaptation of antagonists to hosts, while mutualistic interactions more often promote diversity via the effect of hosts' geographic distribution on mutualists' dispersal.",Herbivory; local adaptation; mutualism; parasitism; population structure.

Due to improper diagnosis, required medical treatment may be skipped. Proper diagnosis is needed as suspected lesions could be missed by the physician's eye. Hence, this problem can be settled up by better means with the investigation of similar case studies present in the healthcare database. In this context, this paper substantiates an assistive system that would help dermatologists for accurate identification of 23 different kinds of melanoma. For this, 2300 dermoscopic images were used to train the skin-melanoma similar image search system. The proposed system uses feature extraction by assigning dynamic weights to the low-level features based on the individual characteristics of the searched images. Optimal weights are obtained by the newly proposed optimized pair-wise comparison (OPWC) approach. The uniqueness of the proposed approach is that it provides the dynamic weights to the features of the searched image instead of applying static weights. The proposed approach is supported by analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and meta-heuristic optimization algorithms such as particle swarm optimization (PSO), JAYA, genetic algorithm (GA), and gray wolf optimization (GWO). The proposed approach has been tested with images of 23 classes of melanoma and achieved significant precision and recall. Thus, this approach of skin melanoma image search can be used as an expert assistive system to help dermatologists/physicians for accurate identification of different types of melanomas.",Analytic hierarchy process (AHP); Content-based medical image retrieval system (CBMIR); Jaya algorithm; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Skin melanoma.
2255,Early author profiling on Twitter using profile features with multi-resolution,"Pastor Lopez-Monroy, A.; Gonzalez, Fabio A.; Solorio, Thamar","The Author Profiling (AP) task aims to predict demographic characteristics about the authors from documents (e.g., age, gender, native language). The research so far has focused only on forensic scenarios by performing post-analysis using all the available text evidence. This paper introduces the task of Early Author Profiling (EAP) in Twitter. The goal is to effectively recognize profiles using as few tweets as possible from the user history. The task is highly relevant to support social media analysis and different problems related to security and marketing, where prevention and anticipation is crucial. This work proposes a novel strategy that combines a state of the art representation for early text classification and specialized word-vectors for author profiling tasks. In this strategy we build prototypical features called Profile based Meta-Words, which allow us to model AP information at different levels of granularity. Our evaluation shows that the proposed methodology is well suited for profiling little text evidence (e.g., a handful of tweets) in early stages, but as more tweets become available other granularities better encode larger amounts of text in late stages. We evaluated the proposed ideas on gender and language variety identification for English and Spanish, and showed that the proposal outperforms state of the art methodologies. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

The growth of the FSS raises sustainability concerns about different activities across the life cycle of food systems. Analysing energy and material flows in the food systems enables decision-makers to prioritise procurement, kitchen management, and menu design. This study adopted Food waste-Energy-Water-Emissions (FEWE) nexus framework based on the life cycle assessment (LCA) methodology to evaluate the environmental impacts of two different systems of FSS. The effects of pasta cooked at Landmark Mandarin Oriental Hotel (LMO) in Hong Kong using imported ingredients were determined. Then the impacts of the pasta cooked at Artisan Food Company (ART) in Australia and shipped to Hong Kong as a ready-to-eat meal were found. Lastly, we discussed the FEWE nexus trade-offs among the impact results. The ART meal's indirect global warming potential (GWP) causes higher carbon emissions than the LMO meal. Also, the indirect cumulative energy demand (CED) of the ART and LMO meals showed no energy footprint difference. Similarly, indirect water consumption (WC) of the ART and LMO meals do not differ. The direct CED of the ART meal is higher than that of the LMO meal. While the ART meal has higher direct GWP than the LMO, the direct WC of the ART and LMO meals do not differ. Moreover, the indirect ART food waste (FW) is less than the LMO one, while direct FW for both ART and LMO meals is negligible. Conclusively, the localisation of meal preparation in Hong Kong results in better environmental performance than importing ready-to-eat meal.",Food service sector; Carbon emissions; Nexus; Life cycle assessment; Ingredients; Environmental impacts
2257,Graph-Based Surgical Instrument Adaptive Segmentation via Domain-Common Knowledge,"Liu, Jie; Guo, Xiaoqing; Yuan, Yixuan","Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA), aiming to adapt the model to an unseen domain without annotations, has drawn sustained attention in surgical instrument segmentation. Existing UDA methods neglect the domain-common knowledge of two datasets, thus failing to grasp the inter-category relationship in the target domain and leading to poor performance. To address these issues, we propose a graph-based unsupervised domain adaptation framework, named Interactive Graph Network (IGNet), to effectively adapt a model to an unlabeled new domain in surgical instrument segmentation tasks. In detail, the Domain-common Prototype Constructor (DPC) is first advanced to adaptively aggregate the feature map into domain-common prototypes using the probability mixture model, and construct a prototypical graph to interact the information among prototypes from the global perspective. In this way, DPC can grasp the co-occurrent and long-range relationship for both domains. To further narrow down the domain gap, we design a Domain-common Knowledge Incorporator (DKI) to guide the evolution of feature maps towards domain-common direction via a common-knowledge guidance graph and category-attentive graph reasoning. At last, the Cross-category Mismatch Estimator (CME) is developed to evaluate the category-level alignment from a graph perspective and assign each pixel with different adversarial weights, so as to refine the feature distribution alignment. The extensive experiments on three types of tasks demonstrate the feasibility and superiority of IGNet compared with other state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, ablation studies verify the effectiveness of each component of IGNet.

Low performance diagnostics, limited therapeutics and poor societal awareness of invasive fungal infections are some of the perennial challenges which have contributed to the unacceptably high death rates from these serious infections. However, recent advances have been recorded in fungal diagnostics and therapeutics development. Research into the development of vaccines to prevent fungal disease is beginning to yield promising results.

Atlas selection has been proposed as a way to improve the accuracy and execution time of segmentation, assuming that, the more similar the atlas is to the patient, the better the results will be. This paper presents an analysis of atlas selection methods in the context of radiotherapy treatment planning. For a range of commonly contoured OARs, a thorough comparison of a large class of typical atlas selection methods has been performed. For this evaluation, clinically contoured CT images of the head and neck ( ${N}={316}$ ) and thorax ( ${N}={280}$ ) were used. The state-of-the-art intensity and deformation similarity-based atlas selection methods were found to compare poorly to perfect atlas selection. Counter-intuitively, atlas selection methods based on a fixed set of representative atlases outperformed atlas selection methods based on the patient image. This study suggests that atlas-based segmentation with currently available selection methods compares poorly to the potential best performance, hampering the clinical utility of atlas-based segmentation.

2260,Gait representation and recognition from temporal co-occurrence of flow fields,"Rashwan, Hatem A.; Angel Garcia, Miguel; Chambon, Sylvie; Puig, Domenec","This paper proposes a new gait representation that encodes the dynamics of a gait period through a 2D array of 17-bin histograms. Every histogram models the co-occurrence of optical flow states at every pixel of the normalized template that bounds the silhouette of a target subject. Five flow states (up, down, left, right, null) are considered. The first histogram bin counts the number of frames over the gait period in which the optical flow for the corresponding pixel is null. In turn, each of the remaining 16 bins represents a pair of flow states and counts the number of frames in which the optical flow vector has changed from one state to the other during the gait period. Experimental results show that this representation is significantly more discriminant than previous proposals that only consider the magnitude and instantaneous direction of optical flow, especially as the walking direction gets closer to the viewing direction, which is where state-of-the-art gait recognition methods yield the lowest performance. The dimensionality of that gait representation is reduced through principal component analysis. Finally, gait recognition is performed through supervised classification by means of support vector machines. Experimental results using the public CMU MoBo and AVAMVG datasets show that the proposed approach is advantageous over state-of-the-art gait representation methods.",Gait recognition; Action recognition; Temporal co-occurrence; Optical flow; PCA; Support vector machine

Twenty-four OSA children (6.5 ± 2.8 years, 15 males) and 26 healthy controls (8.0 ± 2.9 years, 11 males) underwent resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI), based on which brain functional networks were constructed. We compared the global and regional topological properties of the network between OSA children and healthy controls. Partial correlation analysis was performed between topological properties and cognitive scores across OSA children. When comparing the OSA children with the healthy controls, lower full-scale intelligent quotient (FIQ) and verbal intelligent quotient (VIQ) were observed. Additionally, nodal degree centrality decreased in the bilateral anterior cingulate and paracingulate gyrus, but increased in the right middle frontal gyrus, the left fusiform gyrus, and the left supramarginal gyrus. Nodal efficiency decreased in the right precentral gyrus, and the bilateral anterior cingulate and paracingulate gyrus, but increased in the left fusiform gyrus. Nodal betweenness centrality increased in the dorsolateral part of the right superior frontal gyrus, the left fusiform gyrus, and the left supramarginal gyrus. Further, the nodal degree centrality in the left supramarginal gyrus was positively correlated with FIQ. In contrast, none of global topological properties showed difference between those two groups. The outcomes of OSA may impaired the regional topological properties of the brain functional network of OSA children, which may be potential neural mechanism underlying the cognitive declines of these patients.",Children; Obstructive sleep apnea; Rs-fMRI; Topological properties.

In this study we describe long-term outcomes of patients who underwent robot-assisted laparoscopic pyeloplasty for the correction of symptomatic UPJ obstruction with discordant preoperative Tc-99m MAG-3 renal scintigraphy. Methods: Patients undergoing robot-assisted laparoscopic pyeloplasty for symptomatic UPJ obstruction at a single academic center from 2009 to 2021 were retrospectively reviewed. Patients were categorized into three groups with varying degrees of obstruction based on preoperative MAG-3 imaging: Group 1: no obstruction (Lasix T1/2 clearance <10 minutes), Group 2: equivocal obstruction (Lasix T1/2 clearance 10-20 minutes), and Group 3: obstruction (Lasix T1/2 clearance >20 minutes. Pyeloplasty success was defined as resolution of symptoms and improvement/stable computed tomography (CT) imaging or MAG-3 scintigraphy. Failure was defined as persistence of symptoms with either obstruction on functional imaging, worsening hydronephrosis, or subsequent intervention. Results: A total of 125 cases were identified, with a median patient age of 35 years. Dismembered pyeloplasty technique was performed in 98.4% of cases. Median preoperative split renal function on MAG-3 scintigraphy was the only statistically significant (p = 0.003) difference in preoperative characteristics between the three groups. There were 15 postoperative complications, with a rate of Clavien-Dindo grade 3 or higher complications of 4.8%. Overall pyeloplasty success was 92.8%, with success rates of 100% (15/15) and 97% (32/33) in the no obstruction and equivocal obstruction groups, respectively. Median time to pyeloplasty failure was 20.4 months. Conclusion: Robot-assisted laparoscopic pyeloplasty is a safe and effective surgical intervention for correcting UPJ obstruction. Patients with symptoms of UPJ obstruction and discordant functional imaging studies demonstrate similar or improved success rates after pyeloplasty compared with patients with documented high-grade obstruction. Based on these findings preoperative renal scan may not be reliable in appropriate selection of candidacy for pyeloplasty.",MAG-3 renal imaging; pyeloplasty; robotic procedure; ureteropelvic junction obstruction.
2263,Style-based exploration of illustration datasets,"Garces, Elena; Agarwala, Aseem; Hertzmann, Aaron; Gutierrez, Diego","Searching by style in illustration data sets is a particular problem in Information Retrieval which has received little attention so far. One of its main problems is that the perception of style is highly subjective, which makes labeling styles a very difficult task. Despite being difficult to predict computationally, certain properties such as colorfulness, line style or shading can be successfully captured by existing style metrics. However, there is little knowledge about how we distinguish between different styles and how these metrics can be used to guide users in style-based interactions. In this paper, we propose several contributions towards a better comprehension of illustration style and its usefulness for data exploration and retrieval. First, we provide new insights about how we perceive style in illustration. Second, we evaluate a handmade style clustering of clip art pieces with an existing style metric to analyze how this metric aligns with expert knowledge. Finally, we propose a method for efficient navigation and exploration of large clip art data sets which takes into account both semantic labeling of the data and its style. Our approach combines hierarchical clustering with dimensionality reduction techniques, and strategic sampling to obtain intuitive visualizations and useful visualizations.",Illustration; Style; Exploration; Visualization

Estimating an accurate threshold value for a complex and coarse image is computationally expensive and lacks accuracy and stability. This study is aimed at developing a general histogram-entropy-based thresholding method, referred as our HEBT method, for fast and efficient automatic threshold value evaluation. In the proposed method, the probability density function and Shannon entropy derived from 1D bimodal histogram have been used to find the optimal threshold values automatically. The proposed method implemented with a three-frame differencing segmentation technique has been tested on real-time datasets - change detection 2012, change detection 2014, and Wallflower - to identify pedestrians and vehicles. The performance of our HEBT method has been compared with six state-of-the-art automatic thresholding methods. The experimental segmented image results confirmed that our HEBT method is more adaptable and better suited for real-time systems with severe challenging conditions of great variations. Further, the new HEBT method achieved the best segmentation results with highest values of several performance parameters, i.e. recall, precision, similarity, and f-measure.

In this paper, we propose a predictive set point modulation charging method, which can reduce the system's overshoot and increase the reliability of the system. First, the state-space averaging method is used to establish the electronic physical model of the multicharger system. Secondly, a predictive set point modulation charging control method is designed, and the closed-loop model of the proposed charging system is developed using the buck diagram. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified through extensive simulation and experiments. The experimental results show that compared with the classical design method, the proposed method can effectively suppress the current overshoot.",ART; supercapacitor; multiple chargers; overshoot; set point modulation
2266,Tracking of targets of interest using labeled multi-Bernoulli filter with multi-sensor control,"Panicker, Sabita; Gostar, Amirali Khodadadian; Bab-Hadiashar, Alireza; Hoseinnezhad, Reza","This paper proposes a novel multi-sensor control scheme for tracking of targets of interest in the presence of clutter and detection uncertainty, using labeled multi-Bernoulli filters. The focus is on multi-target tracking applications where multiple centrally connected and controllable sensors are used for tracking of particular targets of interest. We derive an efficient analytical approximation for a task-driven objective function for multi-sensor selective control, that can be computed immediately after the prediction step. Compared to the state-of-the-art, drastic reduction in computation is achieved. Numerical experiments, involving challenging multi-sensor control scenarios, demonstrate how the proposed method can lead to significant improvements in the tracking accuracy of the targets of interest, in comparison to the generic non-selective sensor control methods. It is also shown that while our proposed method has comparable performance to the state-of-art selective sensor control method (selective-PEECS) in terms of the meansquare-error (MSE) of tracking for targets of interest, it runs significantly faster than the state-of-art (both selective and non-selective) multi-sensor control algorithms. Indeed, the resulting reduction in computation time is shown to be in the order of tens to hundreds time, depending on the number of sensors to be controlled. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

2267,A 400 mV 160 nW/Ch Compact Energy Efficient Delta Sigma Modulator for Multichannel Biopotential Signal Acquisition System,"Somappa, Laxmeesha; Baghini, Maryam Shojaei","Analog to digital converter circuit design for biomedical systems with multiple recording channels presents challenges in high density and very low power consumption. Passive integrator and loop-filter based delta-sigma modulators (DSMs) have been recently reported for ultra-low-power and highly energy-efficient data converters for multi-channel biopotential acquisition. However, these modulators rely on a very high oversampling ratio (OSR) to achieve the target resolution. Higher OSR leads to higher power consumption in the modulator and the digital low-pass and decimation filter succeeding the DSM. We present a low OSR passive integrator-based DSM in this work by relying on a duty-cycled resistor (DCR). DCR enables the realization of large time constants in the already passive loop-filter, with minimal area and overhead power consumption. This leads to design ofDSMsthat are highly area, power and energy-efficient, suitable for multi-channel biopotential recording systems. We demonstrate a second order, duty-cycled passive integrator based CTDSM in a 65 nm CMOS technology for a 10 kHz biopotential bandwidth. Measurement results show that the fabricated design achieves an SNDR/DR of 56.36/63.1 dB while consuming only 160 nW power with an OSR of 32 and occupies an area of 0.035 mm(2) with a state-of-the-art energy efficiency of 14.9 fJ/conv.

2268,Exosomes derived from bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells inhibit human aortic vascular smooth muscle cells calcification via the miR-15a/15b/16/NFATc3/OCN axis,"Fengwei Luo,Weikang Guo,Wenhu Liu,Fengwei Luo,Weikang Guo,Wenhu Liu","Cardiovascular events among patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) are associated with vascular calcification (VC). Nevertheless, the process of vascular calcification is complicated. A mechanism of VC is cellular osteogenic transdifferentiation. The mechanism through which bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell-derived exosomes (BMSC-Exo) relieve VC is unknown. For the purpose of this study, we used human aortic vascular smooth muscle cells (HA-VSMCs) stimulated by high phosphate to investigate how BMSC-Exo works. Cell calcification was detected by Alizarin red S staining, AKP activity analysis, and the Ca2+ concentration test. The dual-luciferase reporter gene assays were utilized to confirm the targeting link between miR-15a-5p, miR-15b-5p, and miR-16-5p (miR-15a/15b/16) and nuclear factors of activated T cells 3 (NFATc3). The expression of osteogenic transdifferentiation biomarkers was detected using Western blot and RT-qPCR. Based on our findings, miR-15a/15b/16 plays a crucial role in BMSC-Exo's inhibitory effects on calcification and osteogenic transdifferentiation. We then confirmed that miR-15a/15b/16 specifically target the 3'UTR of NFATc3 mRNA and that three miRNAs are more effective than one miRNA. Moreover, we found that down-regulation of NFATc3 could inhibit osteocalcin (OCN) expression, thereby inhibiting the osteogenic transdifferentiation and calcification of HA-VSMCs. This study found that BMSC-Exo plays a role in calcification inhibition by transferring miR-15a/15b/16 and inhibiting their common target gene NFATc3, which down-regulates OCN expression and thus inhibits HA-VSMC osteogenic transdifferentiation. This study identifies a novel target for therapeutic therapy of CKD-VC.",Chronic kidney disease; Exosomes; Osteogenic transdifferentiation; Vascular calcification; microRNA.

This technology allows users to embody someone else through virtual experiences, taking another's perspective and perceive their avatar's actions as their own. Thus, Perspective-Taking with Virtual Reality (PTVR) looks promising as an entry portal to promote or develop empathic responses. This article presents a state-of-the-art from the academic and scientific literature published between 2015 and 2020 on the use of VR to promote empathic capacity development, with attention to implementations in educational contexts (although not exclusively). Findings include trends about the use of VR to promote empathic responses and how previous studies have carried out experimentations.

Cellular chickpea powders ('CCPs') are a new alternative to pulse flours. Here we investigated the in vitro bioaccessibility of essential amino acids ('EAAs') from CCP-enriched bread products and determined the effect of their consumption on serum amino acid responses in healthy humans (n = 20, randomised cross-over design). Breads were prepared with 0, 30 and 60 % of the wheat flour replaced by CCP (intact cells containing encapsulated protein). We found that significant proportion of EAAs from encapsulated protein became bioaccessible during in vitro duodenal digestion, and that in vivo serum EAA responses from healthy human participants were significantly higher following consumption of CCP-enriched breads. Furthermore, the EAA profile of in vitro digestion products were well-correlated with in vivo peak serum EAAs responses. We conclude that CCP-enrichment of wheat bread improved the amount and diversity of bioavailable EAAs.",Amino acids; Bioaccessibility; Bioavailability; INFOGEST in vitro digestion; Legume plant cells; Protein; Randomised controlled trial.

However, heterozygous variants in FAR1 have been recently linked to a rare genetic disorder called cataracts, spastic paraparesis, and speech delay (CSPSD). Here, we present the first Middle Eastern patient with a de novo pathogenic heterozygous variant in FAR1 identified by exome sequencing (ES) analysis and a detailed overview of the reported clinical phenotypes and genotypes. Our patient represents the milder end of the clinical spectrum, with medication-free seizures by the first year of life, proper speech and fine motor development, as well as an absence of other previously reported features such as learning difficulties, axial hypotonia, and joint contracture. In addition, she had developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH) that failed medical management, as well as faltering growth.

For fundamental molecular insights and rational guidance of experimental developments, efficient and sufficiently accurate molecular simulations are thus in urgent need. Here, we construct a molecular dynamics (MD) computer simulation model of representative state-of-the art electrolyte-solvent systems for Li/S batteries constituted by lithium-bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonimide (LiTFSI) and LiNO3 electrolytes in mixtures of the organic solvents 1,2-dimethoxyethane (DME) and 1,3-dioxolane (DOL). We benchmark and verify our simulations by comparing structural and dynamic features with various available experimental reference systems and demonstrate their applicability for a wide range of electrolyte-solvent compositions. For the state-of-the-art battery solvent, we finally calculate and discuss the detailed composition of the first lithium solvation shell, the temperature dependence of lithium diffusion, as well as the electrolyte conductivities and lithium transference numbers. Our model will serve as a basis for efficient future predictions of electrolyte structure and transport in complex electrode confinements for the optimization of modern Li/S batteries (and related devices).",Battery; Electrolyte; Molecular dynamics; Conductivity; Solvation; Ion pairing

Depletion of nutrients, decreased infiltration, availability of water in the subsoil, silting, and eutrophication of surface water resources are directly associated with soil degradation. Water erosion is one of the primary causes of erosion. The principal objective of this study was to understand how climate change and land use have affected susceptibility to erosion in the central-eastern region of the state of São Paulo, Brazil, over the past few decades. Using the technique of multicriteria decision analysis and comparison of thematic layers in pairs, different factors that contribute to soil erosion were integrated in a GIS environment to map erosion hotspots. The results indicated increasing very high, high, and medium erosion susceptibility class percentage. Slope and soil types were the most sensitive factors; however, changes in land use, in particular, increased land cultivation and expanded areas highly susceptible to erosion in late 2019. The results of this study will assist in implementing soil conservation practices in such areas, reducing soil degradation, and increasing productivity.",Erosion susceptibility; Multi-criteria analysis; Runoff; Water erosion.

2276,Complete and Interpretable Conformance Checking of Business Processes,"Garcia-Banuelos, Luciano; van Beest, Nick R. T. P.; Dumas, Marlon; La Rosa, Marcello; Mertens, Willem","This article presents a method for checking the conformance between an event log capturing the actual execution of a business process, and a model capturing its expected or normative execution. Given a process model and an event log, the method returns a set of statements in natural language describing the behavior allowed by the model but not observed in the log and vice versa. The method relies on a unified representation of process models and event logs based on a well-known model of concurrency, namely event structures. Specifically, the problem of conformance checking is approached by converting the event log into an event structure, converting the process model into another event structure, and aligning the two event structures via an error-correcting synchronized product. Each difference detected in the synchronized product is then verbalized as a natural language statement. An empirical evaluation shows that the proposed method can handle real datasets and produces more concise and higher-level difference descriptions than state-of-the-art conformance checking methods. In a survey designed according to the technology acceptance model, practitioners showed a preference towards the proposed method with respect to a state-of-the-art baseline.",Process mining; conformance checking; process model; event log; event structure

Type 1 Tfh (Tfh1) cells were recently identified and associated with disease severity in infection and autoimmune diseases. The cellular and molecular requirements to induce human Tfh1 differentiation are not known. Here, using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) and protein validation, we report that human blood CD1c+ dendritic cells (DCs) activated by GM-CSF (also known as CSF2) drive the differentiation of naive CD4+ T cells into Tfh1 cells. These Tfh1 cells displayed typical Tfh molecular features, including high levels of PD-1 (encoded by PDCD1), CXCR5 and ICOS. They co-expressed BCL6 and TBET (encoded by TBX21), and secreted large amounts of IL-21 and IFN-γ (encoded by IFNG). Mechanistically, GM-CSF triggered the emergence of two DC sub-populations defined by their expression of CD40 and ICOS ligand (ICOS-L), presenting distinct phenotypes, morphologies, transcriptomic signatures and functions. CD40High ICOS-LLow DCs efficiently induced Tfh1 differentiation in a CD40-dependent manner. In patients with mild COVID-19 or latent Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection, Tfh1 cells were positively correlated with a CD40High ICOS-LLow DC signature in scRNAseq of peripheral blood mononuclear cells or blood transcriptomics, respectively.

We investigated 53 patients who experienced >50% blood loss during open elective abdominal aortic aneurysm surgery to assess allogeneic blood component usage and coagulopathy. Specialist patient blood management practitioners used a tailored cell salvage technique including swab wash to maximise blood return. We assessed the proportion of patients who did not require allogeneic blood components and develop evidence of coagulopathy by thromboelastography (TEG) parameters. Blood loss was 50%-174% (mean [SD] 68% [27%]) of blood volume. The mean (SD) intraoperative decrease in haemoglobin concentration, assessed by arterial blood gas analysis, was 5 (13) g/l. No patient received allogeneic red cells intraoperatively. Four of the 53 (8%) patients received blood components in the first 24 h postoperatively at the anaesthetists' discretion. No patient had intraoperative TEG changes indicative of fibrinolysis or coagulopathy. The 30-day mortality was 2% (one of 53). Reduction of allogeneic transfusion is one aim of patient blood management techniques. We have demonstrated virtual avoidance of allogeneic blood product transfusion despite massive blood loss.

Various studies have been conducted to solve the OOD problem. The current state-of-the-art approach uses a confidence score based on the Mahalanobis distance in a feature space. Although it outperformed the previous approaches, the results were sensitive to the quality of the trained model and the dataset complexity. Herein, we propose a novel OOD detection method that can train more efficient feature space for OOD detection. The proposed method uses an ensemble of the features trained using the softmax-based classifier and the network based on distance metric learning (DML). Through the complementary interaction of these two networks, the trained feature space has a more clumped distribution and can fit well on the Gaussian distribution by class. Therefore, OOD data can be efficiently detected by setting a threshold in the trained feature space. To evaluate the proposed method, we applied our method to various combinations of image datasets. The results show that the overall performance of the proposed approach is superior to those of other methods, including the state-of-the-art approach, on any combination of datasets.",out-of-distribution detection; confidence score; distance metric learning; Siamese network; triplet network; ensemble method; deep learning
2280,Genetic resistance to infections in sheep,"S C Bishop,S C Bishop","This paper considers genetic resistance to infectious disease in sheep, with appropriate comparison with goats, and explores how such variation may be used to assist in disease control. Many studies have attempted to quantify the extent to which host animals differ genetically in their resistance to infection or in the disease side-effects of infection, using either recorded animal pedigrees or information from genetic markers to quantify the genetic variation. Across all livestock species, whenever studies are sufficiently well powered, then genetic variation in disease resistance is usually seen and such evidence is presented here for three infections or diseases of importance to sheep, namely mastitis, foot rot and scrapie. A further class of diseases of importance in most small ruminant production systems, gastrointestinal nematode infections, is outside the scope of this review. Existence of genetic variation implies the opportunity, at least in principle, to select animals for increased resistance, with such selection ideally used as part of an integrated control strategy. For each of the diseases under consideration, evidence for genetic variation is presented, the role of selection as an aid to disease control is outlined and possible side effects of selection in terms of effects in performance, effects on resistance to other diseases and potential parasite/pathogen coevolution risks are considered. In all cases, the conclusion is drawn that selection should work and it should be beneficial, with the main challenge being to define cost effective selection protocols that are attractive to sheep farmers.",Foot rot; Mastitis; Quantitative genetics; Scrapie.

Special care has been taken to the measurement setup, particularly with the generation and verification of the test signals. The verification of the test signals requires either a more performant ADC or alternative measurement methods such as a spectrum analyzer. By means of real measurement examples, it is shown that most existing techniques used for analog measurements can be reused after an adaptation to the new proposed measurement setup.

Whereas exposure to Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) has been associated with the development or exacerbation of psychosis, treatment with cannabidiol (CBD) has been associated with amelioration of psychosis. In this study, we demonstrate a complex effect of CBD in mouse models of psychosis, based on factors, including dose, strain, and genotype. Methods: Adult GluN1 knockdown (GluN1KD) and dopamine transporter knockout (DATKO) mice (almost equally balanced for male/female) were acutely treated with vehicle, THC (4 mg/kg), CBD (60, 120 mg/kg), or THC:CBD (1:15, 4:60 mg/kg) and tested in behavioral assays. Results: GluN1KD and DATKO mice displayed hyperactivity, impaired habituation, and sensorimotor gating, along with increased stereotypy and vertical activity. THC, alone and in combination with CBD, produced a robust ""dampening"" effect on the exploratory behavior regardless of strain or genotype. CBD exhibited a more complex profile. At 60 mg/kg, CBD had minimal effects on horizontal activity, but the effects varied in terms of directionality (increase vs. decrease) in other parameters; effects on stereotypic behaviors differ by genotype, while effects on vertical exploration differ by strain×genotype. CBD at 120 mg/kg had a ""dampening"" effect on exploration overall, except in GluN1KD mice, where no effect was observed. In terms of sensorimotor gating, both THC and CBD had minimal effects, except for 120 mg/kg CBD, which exacerbated the acoustic startle response. Conclusions: Here, we present a study that highlights the complex mechanism of phytocannabinoids, particularly CBD, in models of psychosis-like behavior. These data require careful interpretation, as agonism of the cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1) resulting in a decrease in locomotion can be misinterpreted as ""antipsychotic-like"" activity in murine behavioral outputs of psychosis. Importantly, the THC-mediated decrease in hyperexploratory behavior observed in our models (alone or in combination) was not specific to the genetic mutants, but rather was observed regardless of strain or genotype. Furthermore, CBD treatment, when comparing mutants with their wild-type littermate controls, showed little to no ""antipsychotic-like"" activity in our models. Therefore, it is not only important to consider dose when designing/interpreting therapeutically driven phytocannabinoid studies, but also effects of strain or genetic vulnerability respective to the general population.",cannabidiol; cannabis; psychosis; Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol.

The disease can show X-linked recessive, autosomal dominant or autosomal recessive inheritance trait. Of these, the autosomal forms are caused by mutations in either EDAR or EDARADD. To date, the underlying pathomechanisms or genotype-phenotype correlations for autosomal forms have not completely been disclosed. In this study, we performed a series of in vitro studies for four missense mutations in the death domain of EDAR protein: p.R358Q, p.G382S, p.I388T, and p.T403M. The results revealed that p.R358Q- and p.T403M-mutant EDAR showed different expression patterns from wild-type EDAR in both western blots and immunostainings. NF-κB reporter assays demonstrated that all the mutant EDAR showed reduced activation of NF-κB, but the reduction by p.G382S- and p.I388T-mutant EDAR was moderate. Co-immunoprecipitation assays showed that p.R358Q- and p.T403M-mutant EDAR did not bind with EDARADD at all, whereas p.G382S- and p.I388T-mutant EDAR maintained the affinity to some extent. Furthermore, we demonstrated that all the mutant EDAR proteins analyzed aberrantly bound with TRAF6. Sum of the data suggest that the degree of loss-of-function is different among the mutant EDAR proteins, which may be associated with the severity of the disease.",EDAR; EDARADD; TRAF6; death domain; hypohidrotic ectodermal dysplasia.

2287,Uncovering the impact of income inequality and population aging on carbon emission efficiency: An empirical analysis of 139 countries,"Qiang Wang,Lejia Li,Rongrong Li,Qiang Wang,Lejia Li,Rongrong Li","Income inequality and carbon emission efficiency are the primary issues that need to be addressed to achieve UN sustainable development goals. However, research on the relationship between income inequality and carbon emission efficiency has not received enough attention. To more comprehensively understand how income inequality affects carbon emission efficiency, and how aging and economic growth affect the relationship between income inequality and carbon emissions efficiency, fixed effect regression estimation and threshold effect regression estimation approaches are developed based on panel data of 139 countries from 1998 to 2018. The results show that: (i) there is an inhibitory effect of income inequality on the improvement of carbon emission efficiency; (ii) under the influence of aging, there is a U-shaped relationship between income inequality and carbon emission efficiency, that is, income inequality has an inhibitory effect on the improvement of carbon emission efficiency before promoting it; (iii) along with the rapid economic growth, the inhibitory effect of income inequality on carbon emission efficiency increases, that is, there is an inverted U-shaped relationship between income inequality and carbon emission efficiency. Finally, we combine the changes in spatial and temporal distributions to propose corresponding policy recommendations.",Carbon emission efficiency; Economic growth; Income inequality; Population aging.

In this work, we use asymptotic approximations and curve-fitting techniques to derive accurate closed-form expressions for the error control of MLFMA that can be implemented in common fixed-precision computers. Moreover, using the proposed closed-form expressions in conjunction with the state-of-the-art scheme, we report novel design curves for MLFMA that can be used to determine achievable error limits, as well as the minimum box sizes that can be solved with a given desired error threshold for a wide range of machine precision levels.",Error correction; Closed-form solutions; Antennas; Frequency control; Green's function methods; Finite wordlength effects; Complexity theory; Error analysis; low-frequency breakdown; multilevel fast multipole algorithm (MLFMA); multiple-precision arithmetic

A temptation in transdisciplinary work is to focus on improving scientific practices rather than engage research partners in spaces that mutually respect how we learn from each other and set the stage for change. We used the concept of Nicolescu's Hidden Third to identify and operationalize this transformative space, because it focused on bridging objective and subjective worldviews through art. Between 2014 and 2017, we explored the engagement of indigenous peoples from three inland delta regions in Canada and asa team of interdisciplinary scholars and students who worked together to better understand long-term social-ecological change in those regions. In working together, we identified five characteristics associated with respectful, transformative transdisciplinary space. These included (1) establishing an unfiltered safe place where (2) subjective and objective experiences and (3) different world views could come together through (4) interactive and (5) multiple sensory experiences. On the whole, we were more effective in achieving characteristics 2-5bringing together the subjective and objective experiences, where different worldviews could come togetherthan in achieving characteristic 1creating a truly unfiltered and safe space for expression.

2290,The Fast Heuristic Algorithms and Post-Processing Techniques to Design Large and Low-Cost Communication Networks,"Sun, Yahui; Brazil, Marcus; Thomas, Doreen; Halgamuge, Saman","It is challenging to design large and low-cost communication networks. In this paper, we formulate this challenge as the prize-collecting Steiner Tree Problem (PCSTP). The objective is to minimize the costs of transmission routes and the disconnected monetary or informational profits. Initially, we note that the PCSTP is MAX SNP-hard. Then, we propose some post-processing techniques to improve suboptimal solutions to PCSTP. Based on these techniques, we propose two fast heuristic algorithms: the first one is a quasilinear time heuristic algorithm that is faster and consumes less memory than other algorithms; and the second one is an improvement of a state-of-the-art polynomial time heuristic algorithm that can find high-quality solutions at a speed that is only inferior to the first one. We demonstrate the competitiveness of our heuristic algorithms by comparing them with the state-of-the-art ones on the largest existing benchmark instances (169 800 vertices and 338 551 edges). Moreover, we generate new instances that are even larger (1 000 000 vertices and 10 000 000 edges) to further demonstrate their advantages in large networks. The state-of-the-art algorithms are too slow to find high-quality solutions for instances of this size, whereas our new heuristic algorithms can do this in around 6 to 45s on a personal computer. Ultimately, we apply our post-processing techniques to update the best-known solution for a notoriously difficult benchmark instance to show that they can improve near-optimal solutions to PCSTP. In conclusion, we demonstrate the usefulness of our heuristic algorithms and post-processing techniques for designing large and low-cost communication networks.",Network optimization; communication network topology; prize-collecting Steiner tree

Herein, we used coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10), which has both immune activation and avoids adverse reactions, as a model drug and developed four CoQ10 submicron emulsions modified with sialic acid (SA) and/or monosialotetrahexosyl ganglioside (GM1). On the one hand, SA interacts with L-selectins on the surface of T cells after entering the circulatory system, leading to activation of T cells and enhancement of antitumor immune responses. On the other hand, owing to its immune camouflage, GM1 can prolong the circulation time of the preparation in the body, thereby increasing the accumulation of the drug at the tumor site. In vitro and in vivo experiments showed that SA-modified preparations exhibited stronger immune activation and inhibition of tumor proliferation. Pharmacokinetic experiments showed that GM1-modified preparations have longer circulation times in vivo. However, SA and GM1 co-modification did not produce a synergistic effect on the preparation. In conclusion, the SA-modified CoQ10 submicron emulsion (Q10-SE) showed optimal antitumor efficacy when administered at a medium dose (6 mg CoQ10 kg-1). In this study, the submicron emulsion model was used as a carrier, and the tumor-bearing mice were used as animal models. In addition, CoQ10 submicron emulsion was modified with SA-CH with active targeting function and/or GM1 with long-circulation function to explore the antitumor effects of different doses of CoQ10 submicron emulsion, and to screen the best tumor immunotherapy formulations of CoQ10.",coenzyme Q10; immunotherapy; monosialotetrahexosyl ganglioside; sialic acid; submicron emulsion.

We prove that the sample weight tuning method used in KFHE is a version of adaptive boosting, and the weight distribution does not change anymore and leads to redundant classifiers when the algorithm iterates enough times. This motivates us to select a sub-ensemble to alleviate the redundancy and improve the performance of the ensemble. An Ordering-based Kalman Filter Selective Ensemble (OKFSE) is proposed in this paper to select a sub-ensemble using the margin distance minimization approach. We demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of OKFSE through extensive experiments on 20 real-world UCI datasets, and the statistical test shows that OKFSE significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art KFHE and clustering-based pruning methods on these datasets with 5% and 10% class label noise.",Machine learning; classification; selective ensemble; ordering-based pruning; Kalman filter
2294,Do soil Fe transformation and secretion of low-molecular-weight organic acids affect the availability of Cd to rice?,"Xue Chen,Yazhou Yang,Danqing Liu,Chunhua Zhang,Ying Ge,Xue Chen,Yazhou Yang,Danqing Liu,Chunhua Zhang,Ying Ge","The bioavailability of cadmium (Cd) to rice may be complicated by chemical and biological factors in the rhizosphere. The aim of this work is to investigate how soil iron (Fe) redox transformations and low-molecular-weight organic acid (LMWOA) exudation from root affect Cd accumulation in rice. Two soils (a paddy soil and a saline soil) with different physicochemical properties were used in this study. Soil redox conditions were changed by flooding and addition of organic matter (OM). Two days after the soil treatments, rice seedlings were transplanted in a vermiculite-soil system and grown for 10 days. We measured pH and Eh, LMWOA, Fe and Cd contents in rice, and their fractions in the soils and vermiculite. Cadmium accumulation in rice declined in both soils upon the flooding and OM treatment. Iron dissolution in the paddy soil and its deposition in the rhizosphere significantly increased upon the OM addition, but the concentration of Fe plaque on the rice root significantly declined. Conversely, although Fe transformed into less active fractions in the saline soil, Fe accumulation on the surface and in the tissue of root was considerably enhanced. The secretion of LMWOA was remarkably induced when the OM was amended in the saline soil, but the same effect was not observed in the paddy soil. Reduction of Cd uptake by rice could be attributed to different factors in the two soils. For the paddy soil, the lowered Cd bioavailability was likely due to the competition of Fe and Cd for the binding sites on the vermiculite surface. For the saline soil, however, rice responded to the low Fe mobility through more LMWOA exudation and Fe plaque formation, and their increases could explain the decrease of rice Cd.",Bioavailability; Cadmium; Iron; Organic acids; Rice; Soils.
2295,Local performing arts and recovery from the Great East Japan earthquake and tsunami: A descriptive qualitative study,"Iizuka, Akiko","The purpose of this study is to understand the role of local performing arts in disaster recovery after the 2011 Great East Japan earthquake and tsunami. A qualitative descriptive methodology was used to obtain insights into local people's experiences and perspectives. Three main methods were used to collect data: semi-structured group interviews with five traditional preservation societies including 13 participants, as well as interviews with two key informants, a questionnaire survey with 53 respondents, and field observation and visual data. The study setting was an area called Karakuwa, which is located in Miyagi Prefecture. Four themes with 11 associated sub-themes were generated: 1. Locality, 2. Connections with other areas, 3. Connections within the community, and 4. Psychosocial support. Findings indicated that local performing arts are embedded in people's lives and are based on knowledge and experiences that have been transmitted through generations. Although the people experienced the tsunami, they gradually began to perform again within the community as a means of regaining their identity and encouraging themselves and others. In addition, they began to perform to non-locals to show their appreciation for the assistance they had received and in attempts to increase the number of people involved in the activities. A key implication for policy is that, in disaster-recovery efforts, it is necessary to invest in local performing arts in order to help people restore their ways of life and promote ties among locals and connections with non-locals.",Great East Japan earthquake and tsunami; Japan; Local performing arts; Recovery; Qualitative
2296,A low latency implementation of a non-uniform partitioned convolution algorithm for room acoustic simulation,"Primavera, Andrea; Cecchi, Stefania; Romoli, Laura; Peretti, Paolo; Piazza, Francesco","Finite impulse response convolution is one of the most widely used operations in digital signal processing field for filtering operations. Low computationally demanding techniques are essential for calculating convolutions with low input/output latency in real scenarios, considering that the real-time requirements are strictly related to the impulse response length. In this context, a complete overview of the state of the art relative to the algorithms for fast computation of convolution is described here. Then, a novel perceptual approach employed to reduce the computational cost of fast convolution algorithms is here presented. It is based on the pre-processing of a selected impulse response and it allows to further reduce the number of complex multiplications considering the energy decay relief and the absolute threshold of hearing, as psychoacoustic constraints. Several results are reported in terms of computational cost and perceived audio quality in order to prove the effectiveness of the proposed approach also introducing comparisons with the existing techniques of the state of the art.",Absolute threshold of hearing; Energy decay relief; Fast convolution; Non-uniform partitioning; Room acoustic

The agro-technological revolution with metal oxide engineered nanoparticles (MeOx ENPs) has the potential to reform the resilient agricultural system while maintaining the security of food. When utilized extensively, MeOx ENPs may have unintended toxicological effects on both target and non-targeted species. Since limited information about nanopesticides' pernicious effects is available, in silico modeling can be done to explore these issues. Hence, in the present work, we have applied computational modeling to explore the influence of metal oxide nanoparticles on the toxicity of bronchial epithelial (BEAS-2B) and murine myeloid (RAW 264.7) cells to bridge the data gap relating to the toxicity of MeOx NPs. Initially, partial least squares (PLS) regression models were developed applying the Small Dataset Modeler software (http://teqip.jdvu.ac.in/QSAR_Tools/DTCLab/) using four datasets having effective concentration (EC50%) as the endpoints and employing only periodic table descriptors. To further explore the predictions, we applied a read-across approach using the descriptors selected in the QSAR models. Also, the inter-endpoint cytotoxicity relationship modeling (quantitative toxicity-toxicity relationship or QTTR) was conducted. It was found that the result obtained by nano-read-across provided a similar level of accuracy as provided by QSAR. The information derived from the PLS models of both the cell lines suggested that metal cation formation, and bond-forming capacity influence the toxicity whereas the presence of metal has an influential impact on the ecotoxicological effects. Thus, it is feasible to design safe nanopesticides that could be more effective than conventional analogs.",Nanopesticides; QSTR; interspecies; read-across; small dataset modeler.

The properties are usually discussed in the framework of 2D materials, where strong excitonic effects dominate the optical properties near the band edge. At the same time, NPLs have finite lateral dimensions such that NPLs are not true extended 2D structures. Here we study the photophysics and gain properties of CdSe/CdS/ZnS core-shell-shell NPLs upon electrochemical n doping and optical excitation. Steady-state absorption and PL spectroscopy show that excitonic effects are weaker in core-shell-shell nanoplatelets due to the decreased exciton binding energy. Transient absorption studies reveal a gain threshold of only one excitation per nanoplatelet. Using electrochemical n doping, we observe the complete bleaching of the band edge exciton transitions. Combining electrochemical doping with transient absorption spectroscopy, we demonstrate that the gain threshold is fully removed over a broad spectral range and gain coefficients of several thousand cm-1 are obtained. These doped NPLs are the best performing colloidal nanomaterial gain medium reported to date, with the lowest gain threshold and broadest gain spectrum and gain coefficients that are 4 times higher than in n-doped colloidal quantum dots. The low exciton binding energy due to the CdS and ZnS shells, in combination with the relatively small lateral size of the NPLs, results in excited states that are effectively delocalized over the entire platelet. Core-shell NPLs are thus on the border between strong confinement in QDs and dominant Coulombic effects in 2D materials. We demonstrate that this limit is in effect ideal for optical gain and that it results in an optimal lateral size of the platelets where the gain threshold per nm2 is minimal.",doping; electrochemistry; femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy; nanoplatelets; optical gain.

Although SARS-CoV-2 vaccines and therapeutics are currently available, there is still a need for development of safe and effective drugs against SARS-CoV-2 and also for preparedness for the next pandemic. Here, we discover that astersaponin I (AI), a triterpenoid saponin in Aster koraiensis inhibits SARS-CoV-2 entry pathways at the plasma membrane and within the endosomal compartments mainly by increasing cholesterol content in the plasma membrane and interfering with the fusion of SARS-CoV-2 envelope with the host cell membrane. Moreover, we find that this functional property of AI as a fusion blocker enables it to inhibit the infection with SARS-CoV-2 variants including the Alpha, Beta, Delta, and Omicron with a similar efficacy, and the formation of syncytium, a multinucleated cells driven by SARS-CoV-2 spike protein-mediated cell-to-cell fusion. Finally, we claim that the triterpene backbone as well as the attached hydrophilic sugar moieties of AI are structurally important for its inhibitory activity against the membrane fusion event. Overall, this study demonstrates that AI is a natural viral fusion inhibitor and proposes that it can be a broad-spectrum antiviral agent against current COVID-19 pandemic and future outbreaks of novel viral pathogens.",Aster koraiensis; Astersaponin I; COVID-19; Membrane fusion; SARS-CoV-2 variants; Syncytium.

In this paper, we propose a two-level Bregman Method with dictionary updating for highly undersampled magnetic resonance (MR) image reconstruction. The outer-level Bregman iterative procedure enforces the sampled k-space data constraints, while the inner-level Bregman method devotes to updating dictionary and sparse representation of small overlapping image patches, emphasizing local structure adaptively. Modified sparse coding stage and simple dictionary updating stage applied in the inner minimization make the whole algorithm converge in a relatively small number of iterations, and enable accurate MR image reconstruction from highly undersampled k-space data. Experimental results on both simulated MR images and real MR data consistently demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can efficiently reconstruct MR images and present advantages over the current state-of-the-art reconstruction approach.",Augmented Lagrangian; Bregman iterative method; dictionary updating; image reconstruction; magnetic resonance imaging (MRI); sparse representation

State-of-the-art visual grouping algorithms, however, seem to give comparatively little attention to neural synchronization analogies. Based on the framework of concurrent synchronization of dynamical systems, simple networks of neural oscillators coupled with diffusive connections are proposed to solve visual grouping problems. The key idea is to embed the desired grouping properties in the choice of the diffusive couplings, so that synchronization of oscillators within each group indicates perceptual grouping of the underlying stimulative atoms, while desynchronization between groups corresponds to group segregation. Compared with state-of-the-art approaches, the same algorithm is shown to achieve promising results on several classical visual grouping problems, including point clustering, contour integration, and image segmentation.",Grouping; image segmentation; neural oscillator; synchronization; vision

When confronted with a new host, a virus may even infect it and transmit sustainably in this new host, a process called 'viral spillover'. However, the risk of such events is difficult to quantify. As climate change is rapidly transforming environments, it is becoming critical to quantify the potential for spillovers. To address this issue, we resorted to a metagenomics approach and focused on two environments, soil and lake sediments from Lake Hazen, the largest High Arctic freshwater lake in the world. We used DNA and RNA sequencing to reconstruct the lake's virosphere in both its sediments and soils, as well as its range of eukaryotic hosts. We then estimated the spillover risk by measuring the congruence between the viral and the eukaryotic host phylogenetic trees, and show that spillover risk increases with runoff from glacier melt, a proxy for climate change. Should climate change also shift species range of potential viral vectors and reservoirs northwards, the High Arctic could become fertile ground for emerging pandemics.",High Arctic; cophylogeny; host restrictions; spillovers; viral metagenomics.

Compound separation due to 2 D selectivity was observed. Phytotoxic effects of Schinus essential oils were assessed on germination and initial growth of Arabidopsis thaliana. All essential oils in all tested quantities (5 μL, 10 μL, 15 μL, 20 μL, and 25 μL) affected germination rate, speed of accumulated germination, and root and shoot length of A. thaliana. Considering the mode of action of the essential oils, no differences were observed on expression of the genes ANP1 and CDK B1;1 in A. thaliana, which was analyzed by RT-qPCR.

The rats were divided into five groups with eight animals in each group; Control, DMSO (150 µL for per rats), CURC, 30 mg/kg/day), ABE (26 mg/kg/day), and ABE + CURC (26 mg/kg/day ABE, 30 mg/kg/day) groups. Injections were administered daily for 28 days. The levels of AST, LDH, HDL, LDL, triglyceride, and total cholesterol in serum, and hepatic tissue fibrosis, caspase-3, Bax, and TNF-α expression were higher in the ABE group compared to the control group (p < 0.05). Also, these parameters in the ABEM + CURC group were lower than in the ABE group (p < 0.05). The results showed that ABE administration could cause liver damage and increase fibrosis in the liver. In addition, it was shown that co-administration of CURC with ABE could suppress the levels of AST, LDH, HDL, LDL, triglyceride, and total cholesterol in serum, and fibrosis, caspase-3, Bax, and TNF-α expressions in the liver.

This due to the lower ultrasound wave attenuation, the reduced health risks, and the reduced external interference. Current state-of-the-art ultrasound designs, however, are limited in their practical in-body deployment and reliability. This stems from their use of bulky, focused transducers, the use of simple modulation schemes or the absence of a realistic test environment and corresponding realistic channel models. Therefore, this paper proposes a new, ultrasound, static emulation test bed consisting of small, omnidirectional transducers, and custom gelatin phantoms with additional scattering materials. Using this test bed, we investigate different in-body communication scenarios. Multiple communication channels were extracted and mapped onto finite impulse response (FIR) channel models, which are verified and open sourced for future research. Furthermore, a basic quadrature-amplitude modulation (QAM) modem was built to assess the communication performance under various modulation schemes. A link was established using 4-QAM and 200 kbit/s resulting in a BER <1e-4 at received Eb/No of 13dB. Identical results were obtained by computer simulations on the FIR channels, which makes the extracted FIR channels suitable for the design of future ultrasound in-body communication schemes.",Channel estimation; gelatin phantoms; intra-body communications; QAM modulation; ultrasonic; ultrasound impulse response; wireless communication

Forty-five different noodle formulations were produced. Cooking loss values of the noodles raised with increasing ratios of germinated wheat flours. Heat-moisture treatment partially decreased the cooking loss of noodle prepared with germinated wheat flour. The ash, protein, phytic acid, total yellow pigment, total phenolic content, minerals (except K) and antioxidant activity values of the noodle increased with the inclusion of ancient wheat compared to modern wheat.

2312,Region-Enhancing Network for Semantic Segmentation of Remote-Sensing Imagery,"Zhong, Bo; Du, Jiang; Liu, Minghao; Yang, Aixia; Wu, Junjun","Semantic segmentation for high-resolution remote-sensing imagery (HRRSI) has become increasingly popular in machine vision in recent years. Most of the state-of-the-art methods for semantic segmentation of HRRSI usually emphasize the strong learning ability of deep convolutional neural network to model the contextual relationship in the image, which takes too much consideration on every pixel in images and subsequently causes the problem of overlearning. Annotation errors and easily confused features can also lead to the confusion problem while using the pixel-based methods. Therefore, we propose a new semantic segmentation network-the region-enhancing network (RE-Net)-to emphasize the regional information instead of pixels to solve the above problems. RE-Net introduces the regional information into the base network, to enhance the regional integrity of images and thus reduce misclassification. Specifically, the regional context learning procedure (RCLP) can learn the context relationship from the perspective of regions. The region correcting procedure (RCP) uses the pixel aggregation feature to recalibrate the pixel features in each region. In addition, another simple intra-network multi-scale attention module is introduced to select features at different scales by the size of the region. A large number of comparative experiments on four different public datasets demonstrate that the proposed RE-Net performs better than most of the state-of-the-art ones.",semantic segmentation; remote sensing imagery (HRRSI); deep convolutional neural network; regional integrity of images

Herein, we provide the proof of concept of the use of a novel material obtained by combining the grafting of caffeic acid or resveratrol on a poly(lactide-co-glycolide) backbone (g-CA-PLGA or g-RV-PLGA) and the pleiotropic effects of fluvastatin chosen because of its low lipophilic profile which is challenging for the encapsulation in NPs and delivery to the artery wall cells. NPs made of such materials are biocompatible with macrophages, human smooth muscle cells (SMCs), and endothelial cells (ECs). Their cellular uptake is demonstrated and quantified by confocal microscopy using fluorescent NPs, while their distribution in the cytoplasm is verified by TEM images using NPs stained with an Ag-PVP probe appositely synthetized. g-CA-PLGA assures the best control of the FLV release from NP sizing around 180 nm and the faster SMC uptake, as demonstrated by confocal analyses. Interestingly and surprisingly, g-CA-PLGA improves the FLV efficacy to inhibit the SMC migration, without altering its effects on EC proliferation and migration. The improved trophism of NPs toward SMCs, combined with the excellent biocompatibility and low modification of the microenvironment pH upon polymer degradation, makes g-CA-PLGA a suitable material for the design of drug-eluting balloons.",DIL; confocal microscopy; fluvastatin; prolonged release; resveratrol; silver nanoparticle.

The present study investigated the concentration of lead (Pb) and nickel (Ni) in soils and vegetables grown along the roadside of District Swat, Pakistan, and the health risks associated with the consumption of the tested vegetables. In results, Pb concentration was higher in plants located at the distance between 0-10 m away from the roadside than the WHO permissible limit. In such plants, Pb concentration was higher than Ni. Rumex dentatus contained the highest concentration of Pb (75.63 mg kg-1 DW) among the tested vegetables while Ni concentration (27.57 mg kg-1 DW) was highest in Trachyspermum ammi as compared to other plants. Concentration and accumulation of both the metals decreased in soil and plants with increasing distance from the road. Similarly, target hazard quotient values noted for Pb (up to 3.37) were greater than unity, which shows that there is a potential risk associated with the consumption of tested vegetables near the road. Moreover, the values of target cancer risk (up to 0.8413) were greater than 0.0001, which shows that there is a risk of cancer with the consumption of tested vegetables. In conclusion, the consumption of tested vegetables was very dangerous as it may lead to higher risks of cancer. Strict regulatory control is recommended on the cultivation of these vegetables along the roadside to avoid any contamination due to roadside exhaust.",Cancer risk assessment; Health risk assessment; Heavy metals; Plants; Roadside soils; Vegetables.

Instead of using a whole color checker as a training sample set, in this paper, we introduce a novel framework named the Patch Adaptive Selection with K-Means (P-ASK) to extract a subset of dominant colors from a digital image and automatically identify their corresponding chips in the color chart used as characterizing colorimetric reference. We tested the methodology on a set of rock art painting images captured with a number of digital cameras. The characterization approach based on the P-ASK framework allows the reduction of the training sample size and a better color adjustment to the chromatic range of the input scene. In addition, the computing time required for model training is less than in the regular approach with all color chips, and obtained average color differences Delta E-ab(*) lower than two CIELAB units. Furthermore, the graphic and numeric results obtained for the characterized images are encouraging and confirms that the P-ASK framework based on the K-means algorithm is suitable for automatic patch selection for camera characterization purposes.",archaeology; clustering; colorimetry; data mining; machine learning; rock art documentation

2318,Deep Neural Networks With Region-Based Pooling Structures for Mammographic Image Classification,"Shu, Xin; Zhang, Lei; Wang, Zizhou; Lv, Qing; Yi, Zhang","Breast cancer is one of the most frequently diagnosed solid cancers. Mammography is the most commonly used screening technology for detecting breast cancer. Traditional machine learning methods of mammographic image classification or segmentation using manual features require a great quantity of manual segmentation annotation data to train the model and test the results. But manual labeling is expensive, time-consuming, and laborious, and greatly increases the cost of system construction. To reduce this cost and the workload of radiologists, an end-to-end full-image mammogram classification method based on deep neural networks was proposed for classifier building, which can be constructed without bounding boxes or mask ground truth label of training data. The only label required in this method is the classification of mammographic images, which can be relatively easy to collect from diagnostic reports. Because breast lesions usually take up a fraction of the total area visualized in the mammographic image, we propose different pooling structures for convolutional neural networks(CNNs) instead of the common pooling methods, which divide the image into regions and select the few with high probability of malignancy as the representation of the whole mammographic image. The proposed pooling structures can be applied on most CNN-based models, which may greatly improve the models' performance on mammographic image data with the same input. Experimental results on the publicly available INbreast dataset and CBIS dataset indicate that the proposed pooling structures perform satisfactorily on mammographic image data compared with previous state-of-the-art mammographic image classifiers and detection algorithm using segmentation annotations.",Mammographic image; breast cancer; deep neural networks

In addition, long-time auscultation is time-consuming and laborious， which may lead to misjudgment caused by subjective error. To solve the problem, firstly, the wavelet transform is used to preprocess the bowel sounds signal for noise reduction and enhancement. Secondly, three typical features of intestinal sound were extracted. According to the combination of these features, a three-stage decision was designed to carry out multi-parameter and multi-feature joint threshold detection. This algorithm realized the detection of bowel sound signal and the location of its start and end points, making it possible that the complete bowel sound signal was extracted effectively. In this study, a large number of clinical data and label of bowel sounds were collected, and a new effective evaluation method was proposed to verify the proposed method. The accuracy rate is 83.51%.

However, the sequence of early pathophysiological events leading to HD still remains elusive. To gain new insights into the early polyQ-induced pathogenic events, we expressed Htt exon1 (Httex1) with a normal (21), or an extended (42 or 63) number of polyQ in tobacco plants. Here, we show that transgenic plants accumulated Httex1 proteins with corresponding polyQ tracts, and mHttex1 induced protein aggregation and affected plant growth, especially root and root hair development, in a polyQ length-dependent manner. Quantitative proteomic analysis of young roots from severely affected Httex1Q63 and unaffected Httex1Q21 plants showed that the most reduced protein by polyQ63 is a GTP cyclohydrolase I (GTPCH) along with many of its related one-carbon (C1) metabolic pathway enzymes. GTPCH is a key enzyme involved in folate biosynthesis in plants and tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) biosynthesis in mammals. Validating studies in 4-week-old R6/2 HD mice expressing a mHttex1 showed reduced levels of GTPCH and dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR, a key folate utilization/alternate BH4 biosynthesis enzyme), and impaired C1 and BH4 metabolism. Our findings from mHttex1 plants and mice reveal impaired expressions of GTPCH and DHFR and may contribute to a better understanding of mHtt-altered C1 and BH4 metabolism, and their roles in the pathogenesis of HD.",Dihydrofolate reductase; GTP cyclohydrolase I; Huntington’s disease; One-carbon metabolism; Protein aggregation; Quantitative proteomic analysis; Tetrahydrobiopterin biosynthesis.

First-line immunotherapies include intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), plasma exchange and corticosteroids. However, nearly 15-30% of patients are either refractory, partially responsive or chronically dependent on these first-line agents. Lack of full response leads to increased disability in addition to adverse financial implications. Consequently, there is an unmet need for more effective treatments to manage this subset of patients. There has been a remarkable increase in the knowledge about immunopathogenesis, antigenic targets, clinical phenotype correlation, and novel therapeutic agents in the last two decades. These novel agents target specific components of the immune system (humoral, cellular immunity, and complement) and have the potential to improve the management of these disorders. Unfortunately, high-quality evidence from large, controlled studies is scarce considering the relative rarity of these refractory cases, heterogeneity of clinical presentations and ethical concerns limiting the use of a placebo arm. An adaptive clinical trial design in a homogenous cohort with standardized outcomes in multiple centers and the use of historical controls will likely provide valuable scientific evidence about the efficacy and safety of these therapies. In this review, we examine the status of the newer immunotherapies in the treatment of autoimmune neuropathies based on existing data.",Autoimmune Nodopathies; Chronic Inflammatory Demyelinating Polyneuropathy (CIDP); Guillain Barre syndrome (GBS); Intravenous Immunoglobulin (IVIG); Multifocal Motor Neuropathy (MMN); Novel therapies; Subcutaneous Immunoglobulin (SCIG).
2323,Discrimination of EMG Signals Using a Neuromorphic Implementation of a Spiking Neural Network,"Donati, Elisa; Payvand, Melika; Risi, Nicoletta; Krause, Renate; Indiveri, Giacomo","An accurate description of muscular activity plays an important role in the clinical diagnosis and rehabilitation research. The electromyography (EMG) is the most used technique to make accurate descriptions of muscular activity. The EMG is associated with the electrical changes generated by the activity of the motor neurons. Typically, to decode the muscular activation during different movements, a large number of individual motor neurons are monitored simultaneously, producing large amounts of data to be transferred and processed by the computing devices. In this paper, we follow an alternative approach that can be deployed locally on the sensor side. We propose a neuromorphic implementation of a spiking neural network (SNN) to extract spatio-temporal information of EMG signals locally and classify hand gestures with very low power consumption. We present experimental results on the input data stream using a mixed-signal analog/digital neuromorphic processor. We performed a thorough investigation on the performance of the SNN implemented on the chip, by: first, calculating PCA on the activity of the silicon neurons at the input and the hidden layers to show how the network helps in separating the samples of different classes; second, performing classification of the data using state-of-the-art SVM and logistic regression methods and a hardware-friendly spike-based read-out. The traditional algorithm achieved a classification rate of $\text{84}\%$ and $\text{81}\%$, respectively, and the spiking learning method achieved $\text{74}\%$. The power consumption of the SNN is $\text{0.05 mW}$, showing the potential of this approach for ultra-low power processing.",EMG signal processing; neuromorphic engineering; spiking neural network; spiking learning
2324,An efficient and light weight polynomial multiplication for ideal lattice-based cryptography,"Yadav, Vijay Kumar; Verma, Shekhar; Venkatesan, S.","Ring-Learning With Errors (Ring-LWE) based cryptographic schemes such as signature, key exchange, and encryption require polynomial multiplication. This multiplication operation is the most time consuming and computationally rigorous process in Ring-LWE. In order to improve the efficiency of the Ring-LWE based schemes, most of the existing schemes use Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) based polynomial multiplication algorithm. It is known that Discrete Sine Transformation (DST) and Discrete Cosine Transformation (DCT) are faster than the FFT. The combination of DCT and DST is Discrete Trigonometric Transform (DTT). When we generalize DTT in terms of FFT form, it becomes Generalized Discrete Fourier Transform (GDFT). In this paper, we propose two new polynomial multiplication techniques using DTT and GDFT. When we applycircular convolutionandskew-circular convolutionon DTT or GDFT for the polynomial multiplication, it gives us wrong results. To overcome this issue, we usesymmetric convolutionoperation on DTT and GDFT. We implemented and compared the proposed polynomial multiplication schemes with the current state-of-the-art schemes in terms of computation and communication costs. The implementation results show that the proposed schemes DTT and GDFT perform more efficiently as compared to current state-of-the-art schemes in terms of computation and communication costs.",Fast fourier transform; Discrete cosine transformation; Number theoretic transform; Lattice-based cryptography; Ring-learning with errors

In recent years, several deep learning-based frameworks have been proposed for object detection. However, these detectors were developed for data sets that considerably differ from aerial images. In this paper, we systematically investigate the potential of fast R-CNN and faster R-CNN for aerial images, which achieve top performing results on common detection benchmark data sets. Therefore, the applicability of eight state-of-the-art object proposal methods used to generate a set of candidate regions and of both detectors is examined. Relevant adaptations to account for the characteristics of the aerial images are provided. To overcome the shortcomings of the original approach in the case of handling small instances, we further propose our own networks that clearly outperform state-of-the-art methods for vehicle detection in aerial images. Furthermore, we analyze the impact of the different adaptations with respect to various ground sampling distances to provide a guideline for detecting small objects in aerial images.

Such studies lead to better assessment of rainfall amounts and spatial variabilities; and have a vital role in impact assessment, mitigation, and prediction of occurrence. Thus, this study has been undertaken in the Subarnarekha River basin using Climate Hazards group Infrared Precipitation with Stations (CHIRPS) dataset. Precipitation datasets helped in deriving hydrometeorological indices such as the Rainfall Anomaly Index (RAI) and Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) for the identification of drought occurrences. The core objective was to infer spatio-temporal drought scenarios and their trend characterization covering four decades over the years 1981 to 2020. Quantitative drought assessment was done using run theory for identifying the Drought Duration (DD), Drought Severity (DS), Drought Intensity (DI), and Drought Frequency (DF). Mann-Kendall (MK) test was performed to understand the precipitation and drought trends at annual and seasonal scales. Eight severe drought events were identified in the Subarnarekha River basin for the past 40 years and the average DI value of 0.8 was recorded. MK test results for the precipitation showed a significant positive trend (95% confidence level) for pre-monsoon periods. However, for SPI, a significant positive trend was observed over the intervals of 3 (SPI3), 6 (SPI6), and 12 (SPI12) months respectively at an annual timescale, suggesting wetter conditions within the study area. Moreover, there had been insignificant negative trends for SPI1 and SPI3 during winter. It indicates that during the short-term SPI scale, i.e., 1 month (SPI1) and 3 months (SPI3), the instances of negative SPI values inferred were high, which point to the increasing incidences of meteorological drought possibly due to deficient soil moisture. Thus, the results indicated that the CHIRPS precipitation product-derived hydrometeorological indices could act as a valuable tool for assessing the past spatio-temporal drought conditions of the Subarnarekha River basin. This may further be helpful in planning for sustainable water resource management of such river basins.",CHIRPS; Mann–Kendall Test; Rainfall Anomaly Index (RAI); Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI); Subarnarekha River basin.
2327,Multiple Beamforming with Perfect Coding,"Li, Boyu; Ayanoglu, Ender","Perfect Space-Time Block Codes (PSTBCs) achieve full diversity, full rate, nonvanishing constant minimum determinant, uniform average transmitted energy per antenna, and good shaping. However, the high decoding complexity is a critical issue for practice. When the Channel State Information (CSI) is available at both the transmitter and the receiver, Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) is commonly applied for a Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) system to enhance the throughput or the performance. In this paper, two novel techniques, Perfect Coded Multiple Beamforming (PCMB) and Bit-Interleaved Coded Multiple Beamforming with Perfect Coding (BICMB-PC), are proposed, employing both PSTBCs and SVD with and without channel coding, respectively. With CSI at the transmitter (CSIT), the decoding complexity of PCMB is substantially reduced compared to a MIMO system employing PSTBC, providing a new prospect of CSIT. Especially, because of the special property of the generation matrices, PCMB provides much lower decoding complexity than the state-of-the-art SVD-based uncoded technique in dimensions 2 and 4. Similarly, the decoding complexity of BICMB-PC is much lower than the state-of-the-art SVD-based coded technique in these two dimensions, and the complexity gain is greater than the uncoded case. Moreover, these aforementioned complexity reductions are achieved with only negligible or modest loss in performance.",MIMO; SVD; perfect space-time block codes; golden code; BICMB; constellation precoding; diversity; decoding complexity

It completes the partial propriocept and percept sequences observed till each sampling instant, and learns where and what to sample by minimizing prediction error, without reinforcement or supervision (class labels). The model is evaluated by exposing it to two kinds of stimuli: images of fully-formed handwritten numerals and alphabets, and videos of gradual formation of numerals. It yields state-of-the-art prediction accuracy upon sampling only 22.6% of the scene on average. The model saccades when exposed to images and tracks when exposed to videos.

""Time is brain"" is a widely accepted concept in acute cerebrovascular disease treatment. Efficient and accurate computational framework for hemodynamic parameters estimation can save critical time for thrombolytic therapy. Meanwhile the high level of accumulated radiation dosage due to continuous image acquisition in CT perfusion (CTP) raised concerns on patient safety and public health. However, low-radiation leads to increased noise and artifacts which require more sophisticated and time-consuming algorithms for robust estimation. In this paper, we focus on developing a robust and efficient framework to accurately estimate the perfusion parameters at low radiation dosage. Specifically, we present a tensor total-variation (TTV) technique which fuses the spatial correlation of the vascular structure and the temporal continuation of the blood signal flow. An efficient algorithm is proposed to find the solution with fast convergence and reduced computational complexity. Extensive evaluations are carried out in terms of sensitivity to noise levels, estimation accuracy, contrast preservation, and performed on digital perfusion phantom estimation, as well as in vivo clinical subjects. Our framework reduces the necessary radiation dose to only 8% of the original level and outperforms the state-of-art algorithms with peak signal-to-noise ratio improved by 32%. It reduces the oscillation in the residue functions, corrects over-estimation of cerebral blood flow (CBF) and under-estimation of mean transit time (MTT), and maintains the distinction between the deficit and normal regions.",Computed tomography perfusion; deconvolution; low-dose; radiation dose safety; regularization; tensor total variation

Methods: Patients who underwent CRC surgery in the department of gastrointestinal surgery of the First Affiliated Hospital from January 2020 to March 2022 were retrospectively enrolled. According to protocol adherence, all patients were divided into the ERAS group and the non-ERAS group. Short-term outcomes were compared between the two groups. Results: A total of 918 patients were enrolled in the study. Based on protocol adherence ≥70%, 265 patients were classified into the ERAS group and the other 653 patients were classified into the non-ERAS group. Patients in the ERAS group had shorter operation time (P < .01), less intraoperative blood loss (P < .01), shorter overall hospital stay (P < .01) and postoperative hospital stay (P < .01), less hospital costs (P < .01), earlier first flatus (P < .01), earlier first stool (P < .01), earlier food tolerance (P < .01), and lower postoperative complications (P < .01). Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis manifested that ERAS and cerebrovascular disease were predictive factors of postoperative overall complications. In univariate analyses, cerebrovascular disease (P = .033, OR = 2.225, 95% CI = 1.066-4.748), time of the surgery (P = .026, OR = 1.417, 95% CI = 1.043-1.925), and ERAS (P < .01, OR = 0.450, 95% CI = 0.307-0.661) were predictive factors. Furthermore, in the multivariate analysis, ERAS (P < .01, OR = 0.440, 95% CI = 0.295-0.656) and cerebrovascular disease (P = .016, OR = 2.575, 95% CI = 1.190-5.575) were independent predictive factors of postoperative overall complications. Conclusion: In summary, under the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, ERAS could still reduce the financial burden of patients and reduce the incidence of short-term postoperative complications. However, whether the effects of ERAS were enhanced after the pandemic and the long-term outcomes of CRC obey ERAS remained to be further explored.",COVID-19; ERAS; colorectal cancer.

When it comes to visual local information extraction, most of the state-of-the-art methods adopt either a strict uniform strategy which can be too rough to catch local details properly, or pre-processing with external cues which may suffer from the deviations of the pre-trained model and the large computation consumption. In this paper, we proposed an Adversarial Self -aligned Part Detecting Network (ASPD-Net) model which extracts and combines multi-granular visual and textual features. A novel Self-aligned Part Mask Module was presented to autonomously learn the information of human body parts, and obtain visual local features in a soft-attention manner by using K Self-aligned Part Mask Detectors. Regarding the main model branches as a generator, a discriminator is employed to determine whether the representation vector comes from the visual modality or the textual modality. With Adversarial Loss training, ASPD-Net can learn more robust representations, as long as it successfully tricks the discriminator. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed ASPD-Net outperforms the previous methods and achieves the state-of-the-art performance on the CUHK-PEDES and RSTPReid datasets.",Part mask detection; Text-based person re-identification; Adversarial learning
2333,Towards Finite File Packetizations in Wireless Device-to-Device Caching Networks,"Woolsey, Nicholas; Chen, Rong-Rong; Ji, Mingyue","We consider wireless device-to-device (D2D) caching networks with single-hop transmissions. Previous work has demonstrated that caching and coded multicasting can significantly increase per user throughput. However, the state-of-the-art coded caching schemes for D2D networks are generally impractical because content files are partitioned into an exponential number of packets with respect to the number of users if both library and memory sizes are fixed. In this paper, we present two combinatorial approaches of D2D coded caching network design with reduced packetizations and desired throughput gain compared to the conventional uncoded unicasting. The first approach uses a ""hypercube"" design, where each user caches a ""hyperplane"" in this hypercube and the intersections of ""hyperplanes"" represent coded multicasting codewords. In addition, we extend the hypercube approach to a decentralized design. The second approach uses the Ruzsa-Szemeredi graph to define the cache placement. Disjoint matchings on this graph represent coded multicasting codewords. Both approaches yield an exponential reduction of packetizations while providing a per-user throughput that is comparable to the state-of-the-art designs in the literature. Furthermore, we apply spatial reuse to the new D2D network designs to further reduce the required packetizations and significantly improve per user throughput for some parameter regimes.",Coded caching; device-to-device communications; packetizations; spatial reuse

An online survey was conducted in which 305 U.S. participants viewed to 20 posts of an SMI and subsequently measured their affective well-being, envy, and inspiration toward the SMI, and self-esteem levels. The results revealed a direct negative relationship between envy and affective well-being, but a positive indirect effect through inspiration. Furthermore, individuals' self-esteem moderates the relationship such that the positive relationship between envy and affective well-being through inspiration is stronger among those with high levels of self-esteem. Moreover, inspiration varies between different influencer categories, that is, participants who viewed fitness influencers reported the greatest amount of inspiration, followed by fashion, beauty, and entertainment influencers.",Instagram; envy; inspiration; self-esteem; social media influencers; well-being.
2335,Generic Proposal Evaluator: A Lazy Learning Strategy Toward Blind Proposal Quality Assessment,"Wu, Qingbo; Li, Hongliang; Meng, Fanman; Ngan, King N.","Existing detection or recognition systems typically select one state-of-the-art proposal algorithm to produce massive object-covered candidate windows, and a quality metric specifically designed for this algorithm is utilized to single out small amounts of proposals. However, in practice, the accuracies of different proposal algorithms significantly change from one image content to another one. To obtain more robust proposal results, a generic proposal evaluator (GPE) is highly desired, which could choose optimal candidate windows across multiple proposal algorithms. In this paper, we propose a lazy learning strategy to train the GPE, which aims to blindly estimate the quality of each proposal without accessing to its manual annotation. Unlike the traditional end-to-end framework that learns a universal model from all training samples, we try to build query-specific training subset for each given proposal, where only its k-nearest-neighborhoods are collected from all labeled candidate windows. Benefits from the capability of updating the regression parameters for different visual contents, the proposed method delivers a higher quality prediction accuracy even with respect to the deep neural network learned by end-to-end method. Experimental results confirm that the proposed algorithm significantly outperforms many state-of-the-art proposal quality metrics.",Object proposal; blind proposal quality assessment; lazy learning

We evaluated the trends of the dietary share of foods categorised according to the NOVA classification in a historical series (2018-2019) among the UK population. Data were acquired from the NDNS, a survey that collects diet information through a 4-d food record. We used adjusted linear regression to estimate the dietary participation of NOVA groups and evaluated the linear trends over the years. From 2008 to 2019, we observed a significant increase in the energy share of culinary ingredients (from 3·7 to 4·9 % of the total energy consumed; P-trend = 0·001), especially for butter and oils; and reduction of processed foods (from 9·6 to 8·6 %; P-trend = 0·002), especially for beer and wine. Unprocessed or minimally processed foods (≅30 %, P-trend = 0·505) and ultra-processed foods (≅56 %, P-trend = 0·580) presented no significant change. However, changes in the consumption of some subgroups are noteworthy, such as the reduction in the energy share of red meat, sausages and other reconstituted meat products as well as the increase of fruits, ready meals, breakfast cereals, cookies, pastries, buns and cakes. Regarding the socio-demographic characteristics, no interaction was observed with the trend of the four NOVA groups. From 2008 to 2019 was observed a significant increase in culinary ingredients and a reduction in processed food. Furthermore, it sheds light on the high share of ultra-processed foods in the contemporary British diet.",Food consumption; Food processing; National diet and nutrition survey; UK.

Our method can generate diverse artworks, including original artworks and imitating artworks, with different artistic styles and high visual complexity. The generation process is fully automated. In order to adapt to the pixel-based method, a von Neumann neighbor topology-modified particle swarm optimization (PSO) is employed to the proposed method. The fitness functions of PSO are well prepared. Firstly, we come up with a set of aesthetic fitness functions. Next, the imitating fitness function is designed. Finally, the aesthetic fitness functions and the imitating fitness function are weighted into one single object function, which is used in the modified PSO. Both the original outputs and imitating outputs are shown.

Safe and effective therapeutics are still lacking. Biodegradable macromolecules (ε-polylysine-g-ferrocene, EPL-g-Fc) were developed to accelerate wound healing by combating bacterial infection and attenuating inflammatory responses. The biodegradable macromolecules were prepared via a Schiff-based reaction between ferrocene carboxaldehyde (Fc) and ε-polylysine (EPL). Through the synergistic combination of positive-charged EPL and π-π stacked Fc, the macromolecules possess excellent antibacterial activities. EPL-g-Fc with catalase-like activity could modulate the oxidative microenvironment in mammalian cells and zebrafish by catalyzing H2O2 into H2O and O2. EPL-g-Fc could alleviate inflammatory response in vitro. Furthermore, the macromolecules could accelerate bacteria-infected wound healing in vivo.

We analyze pros and cons of these approaches and provide a large load forecasting study for Germany that compares the techniques using standard performance and significance measures. Finally, we give general recommendations for the treatment of public holidays in energy forecasting to suggest how the drawbacks particular to most of the state-of-the-art methods can be mitigated. This is especially useful, as the incorporation of holiday effects can improve the forecasting accuracy during public holidays periods by more than 80%, but even for non-holidays periods, the forecasting error can be reduced by approximately 10%.",Public holidays; Bank holidays; Special day effects; Forecasting; Electricity load; Holiday dummy
2342,Cross-Corpus Speech Emotion Recognition Based on Domain-Adaptive Least-Squares Regression,"Zong, Yuan; Zheng, Wenming; Zhang, Tong; Huang, Xiaohua","In this letter, a novel cross-corpus speech emotion recognition (SER) method using domain-adaptive least-squares regression (DaLSR) model is proposed. In this method, an additional unlabeled data set from target speech corpus is used to serve as an auxiliary data set and combined with the labeled training data set from source speech corpus for jointly training the DaLSR model. In contrast to the traditional least-squares regression (LSR) method, the major novelty of DaLSR is that it is able to handle the mismatch problem between source and target speech corpora. Hence, the proposed DaLSR method is very suitable for coping with cross-corpus SER problem. For evaluating the performance of the proposed method in dealing with the cross-corpus SER problem, we conduct extensive experiments on three emotional speech corpora and compare the results with several state-of-the-art transfer learning methods that are widely used for cross-corpus SER problem. The experimental results show that the proposed method achieves better recognition accuracies than the state-of-the-art methods.",Cross-corpus speech emotion recognition (SER); domain adaptation; transfer learning

Auxiliary diagnosis methods of such pediatric malignant cancers are highly needed to provide pathologists assistance and reduce the risk of misdiagnosis before treatments. In this paper, inspired by the particularity of microscopic pathology images, we integrate neural networks with the texture energy measure (TEM) and propose a novel network architecture named DetexNet (deep texture network). This method enforces the low-level representation pattern clearer via embedding the expert knowledge as prior, so that the network can seize the key information of a relatively small pathological dataset more smoothly. By applying and finetuning TEM filters in the bottom layer of a network, we greatly improve the performance of the baseline. We further pre-train the model on unlabeled data with an auto-encoder architecture and implement a color space conversion on input images. Two kinds of experiments under different assumptions in the condition of limited training data are performed, and in both of them, the proposed method achieves the best performance compared with other state-of-the-art models and doctor diagnosis.",Feature extraction; Tumors; Pathology; Cancer; Neural networks; Task analysis; Pediatrics; Assistant pathology diagnosis; deep learning; feature filtering; pediatric cancer

The sketch artist creates sketches based on the witnesses' memories. Sketch artists are few and limited in their availability. It is also evident that as time passes, the eyewitness forgets many of the important details, which can be expensive in time-sensitive investigations. The sketch was used to obtain the suspect's image through the state-of-the-art sketch-photo retrieval model, which missed the relevance of time sensitivity. A linguistic description-based suspect face image retrieval approach is presented in this study. In the proposed approach, the facial attribute-value pair is extracted from eyewitness descriptions. Facial attribute saliency is also studied in this work and validated with the Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (FAHP) model. A weighted score is computed to retrieve the suspect face images.

We aimed to determine the effectiveness of adjunctive interactive virtual classroom training (VCT) in concordance with the self-directed Fundamentals of Robotic Surgery (FRS) curriculum. The virtual classroom is comprised of a studio with multiple audio-visual inputs to which participants can connect remotely via the BARCO weConnect platform. Eleven novice surgical trainees were randomly allocated to two training groups (A and B). In week 1, both groups completed a robotic skills induction. In week 2, Group A received training with the FRS curriculum and adjunctive VCT; Group B only received access to the FRS curriculum. In week 3, the groups received the alternate intervention. The primary outcome was measured using the validated robotic-objective structured assessment of technical skills (R-OSAT) at the end of week 2 (time-point 1) and 3 (time-point 2). All participants completed the training curriculum and were included in the final analyses. At time-point 1, Group A achieved a statistically significant greater mean proficiency score compared to Group B (44.80 vs 35.33 points, p = 0.006). At time-point 2, there was no significant difference in mean proficiency score in Group A from time-point 1. In contrast, Group B, who received further adjunctive VCT showed significant improvement in mean proficiency by 9.67 points from time-point 1 (95% CI 5.18-14.15, p = 0.003).

However, the benefits of antiplatelet therapy always come at a price of increased risk for bleeding, and the clinical values of antiplatelet strategies depend on this characteristic benefit/risk ratio. Platelet function testing aiming at determining an individual's response to the administered agent was hoped to help balance bleeding and thrombosis in order to maximize benefit/risk ratio. However, randomized trials failed to demonstrate an improved clinical outcome of a platelet function-based treatment selection and consequently platelet function testing has not become a routine part of the management of antiplatelet therapies.

2350,Robust Prostate Segmentation Using Intrinsic Properties of TRUS Images,"Wu, Pengfei; Liu, Yiguang; Li, Yongzhong; Liu, Bingbing","Accurate segmentation is usually crucial in transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) image based prostate diagnosis; however, it is always hampered by heavy speckles. Contrary to the traditional view that speckles are adverse to segmentation, we exploit intrinsic properties induced by speckles to facilitate the task, based on the observations that sizes and orientations of speckles provide salient cues to determine the prostate boundary. Since the speckle orientation changes in accordance with a statistical prior rule, rotation-invariant texture feature is extracted along the orientations revealed by the rule. To address the problem of feature changes due to different speckle sizes, TRUS images are split into several arc-like strips. In each strip, every individual feature vector is sparsely represented, and representation residuals are obtained. The residuals, along with the spatial coherence inherited from biological tissues, are combined to segment the prostate preliminarily via graph cuts. After that, the segmentation is fine-tuned by a novel level sets model, which integrates 1) the prostate shape prior, 2) dark-to-light intensity transition near the prostate boundary, and 3) the texture feature just obtained. The proposed method is validated on two 2-D image datasets obtained from two different sonographic imaging systems, with the mean absolute distance on the mid gland images only 1.06 +/- 0.53 mm and 1.25 +/- 0.77 mm, respectively.

However, serious difficulties in attaining pixel-level annotations for sufficiently large volumetric datasets in real-life applications have highlighted the critical need for alternative approaches, such as semi-supervised learning, where model training can leverage small expert-annotated datasets to enable learning from much larger datasets without laborious annotation. Most of the semi-supervised approaches combine expert annotations and machine-generated annotations with equal weights within deep model training, despite the latter annotations being relatively unreliable and likely to affect model optimization negatively. To overcome this, we propose an active learning approach that uses an example re-weighting strategy, where machine-annotated samples are weighted (i) based on the similarity of their gradient directions of descent to those of expert-annotated data, and (ii) based on the gradient magnitude of the last layer of the deep model. Specifically, we present an active learning strategy with a query function that enables the selection of reliable and more informative samples from machine-annotated batch data generated by a noisy teacher.

Ovarian cancer is the leading gynecological cancer with higher mortality rates due to its reoccurrence and late diagnosis. In recent years, the field of medical nanotechnology has witnessed significant progress in addressing existing problems and improving the diagnosis and therapy of various diseases including cancer. Nevertheless, the literature and current reviews on nanotechnology are mainly focused on its applications in other cancers or diseases. In this review, we focused on the nanoscale drug delivery systems for ovarian cancer targeted therapy and diagnosis, and different nanocarriers systems including dendrimers, nanoparticles, liposomes, nanocapsules, and nanomicelles for ovarian cancer have been discussed. In comparison to non-functionalized counterparts of nanoformulations, the therapeutic potential and preferential targeting of ovarian cancer through ligand functionalized nanoformulations' development has been reviewed. Furthermore, numerous biomarkers such as prostatic, mucin 1, CA-125, apoptosis repeat baculoviral inhibitor-5, human epididymis protein-4, and e-cadherin have been identified and elucidated in this review for the assessment of ovarian cancer.

However, in medical image analysis, obtaining high-quality labels for the data is laborious and expensive, as accurately annotating medical images demands expertise knowledge of the clinicians. In this paper, we present a novel relation-driven semi-supervised framework for medical image classification. It is a consistency-based method which exploits the unlabeled data by encouraging the prediction consistency of given input under perturbations, and leverages a self-ensembling model to produce high-quality consistency targets for the unlabeled data. Considering that human diagnosis often refers to previous analogous cases to make reliable decisions, we introduce a novel sample relation consistency (SRC) paradigm to effectively exploit unlabeled data by modeling the relationship information among different samples. Superior to existing consistency-based methods which simply enforce consistency of individual predictions, our framework explicitly enforces the consistency of semantic relation among different samples under perturbations, encouraging the model to explore extra semantic information from unlabeled data. We have conducted extensive experiments to evaluate our method on two public benchmark medical image classification datasets, i.e., skin lesion diagnosis with ISIC 2018 challenge and thorax disease classification with ChestX-ray14.

The usual technique is to learn a dictionary for every device and use the learned dictionaries as basis for blind source separation during disaggregation. Dictionary learning is a synthesis formulation; in this paper, we propose an analysis approach. The advantage of our proposed approach is that, the requirement of training volume drastically reduces compared to state-of-the-art techniques. This means that, we require fewer instrumented homes, or fewer days of instrumentation per home; in either case this drastically reduces the sensing cost.
