0,Tobacco Consumption and High-Sensitivity Cardiac Troponin I in the General Population: The HUNT Study,"Julia Brox Skranes,Magnus Nakrem Lyngbakken,Kristian Hveem,Helge Røsjø,Torbjørn Omland,Julia Brox Skranes,Magnus Nakrem Lyngbakken,Kristian Hveem,Helge Røsjø,Torbjørn Omland","Background Cardiac troponins represent a sensitive index of subclinical myocardial injury and are associated with increased risk of cardiovascular events in the general population. Despite positive associations with cardiovascular risk of both cardiac troponins and cigarette smoking, concentrations of cardiac troponin I measured by high-sensitivity assays (hs-cTnI) are paradoxically lower in current smokers than in never-smokers. The impact of smoking intensity and time from smoking cessation on hs-cTnI remains unknown. Methods and Results hs-cTnI concentrations were measured in 32028 subjects free from cardiovascular disease enrolled in the prospective, population-based HUNT (Trøndelag Health Study). Tobacco habits were self-reported and classified as never (n=14 559), former (n=14 248), and current (n=3221) smokers. Current smokers exhibited significantly lower concentrations of hs-cTnI than never-smokers (P<0.001). In adjusted models, both current smoking (-17.3%; 95% CI, -20.6 to -13.9%) and former smoking (-6.6%; 95% CI, -8.7 to -4.5%) were associated with significantly lower hs-cTnI concentrations. Among former smokers, higher smoking burden (>10 pack-years) were associated with lower concentrations of hs-cTnI. Time since smoking cessation was associated with increasing concentrations of hs-cTnI in a dose-dependent manner (P for trend<0.001), and subjects who quit smoking >30 years ago had concentrations of hs-cTnI comparable with those of never-smokers. Conclusions In the general population, both current and former cigarette smoking is associated with lower concentrations of hs-cTnI. In former smokers, there was a dose-response relationship between pack-years of smoking, and hs-cTnI. Time since smoking cessation was associated with increasing concentrations of hs-cTnI, indicating a continuum of hs-cTnI from current smoker to never-smokers."
1,Approaching towards sustainable supply chain under the spotlight of business intelligence,"Mohammad Reza Seddigh,Sajjad Shokouhyar,Fatemeh Loghmani,Mohammad Reza Seddigh,Sajjad Shokouhyar,Fatemeh Loghmani","These two main objectives of this study are to present a theoretical model to explain how business intelligence capabilities influence the company's supply chain sustainability and to examine the relationships among different BI and CSCS dimensions. This study was conducted with the use of a standard BI questionnaire along with the United Nations CSCS questionnaire among 234 Iranian pharmaceutical companies, from which 188 were also surveyed. Smart pls3 and partial least squares methods were used for validity as well as reliability evaluation of the measurement model. According to the findings, BI significantly affects the sustainability of the pharmaceutical supply chain and some of its dimensions, including vision, scope, and internal aspects, thereby the hypothesis indicating the effect of BI on these dimensions was accepted. However, there was an insignificantly positive relationship between BI and the other dimensions of CSCS, including expectation, engagement, and goals; hence, the hypothesis indicating the effect of BI on these dimensions was rejected. If the policy of the board is to implement supply chain sustainability, BI can have a greater impact on the company. Otherwise, BI may be implemented with not much effect though it can be indirectly beneficial to these companies. No studies have been performed on direct examination of the relationship of BI and CSCS and their various dimensions with the use of an extensive survey among Iran's pharmaceutical companies. Also, this study reveals some facts about the sustainability of the pharmaceutical supply chain, BI, and relevant issues as significant obstacles against a sustainable supply chain and BI. This article also supports the UN questionnaire on supply chain sustainability and adopts it in the surveys. Furthermore, various social networks such as Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram were compared, and it was concluded that the data required for the pharmaceutical industry was more accessible from Twitter, in comparison to the other social networks."
2,Does globalization matter for ecological footprint in Turkey? Evidence from dual adjustment approach,"Kirikkaleli, Dervis; Adebayo, Tomiwa Sunday; Khan, Zeeshan; Ali, Shahid","The main aim of this paper is to explore the role of globalization on ecological footprint in Turkey while controlling energy consumption, economic growth, and trade openness. To achieve this objective, we employ dual adjustment approach. The main novelty of the dual adjustment approach is that the method offers another path to the cointegration analysis by relaxing the implicit assumption of the singular adjustment in cointegration analysis. The findings clearly reveal that (i) in the long run, globalization impacts ecological footprint positively and (ii) trade openness reduces ecological footprint in the short run, while ecological footprint is negatively affected by GDP growth in both the short and the long run. In terms of policy implications, this study suggests that in order to improve the environmental quality, Turkey should adopt such policies that encourage energy consumers to shift toward renewable energy. Moreover, the government should take necessary steps to diversify the overall energy mix toward renewable energy."
3,Myths and Misconceptions About University Student Volunteering: Development and Perpetuation,"Megan Paull,Kirsten Holmes,Maryam Omari,Debbie Haski-Leventhal,Judith MacCallum,Susan Young,Rowena Scott,Megan Paull,Kirsten Holmes,Maryam Omari,Debbie Haski-Leventhal,Judith MacCallum,Susan Young,Rowena Scott","This paper examines myths and misconceptions about university student volunteering. Our study explored the experiences of students, host organisations and universities participating in volunteering in Australia, identify good practice, and discover barriers to success. A qualitative approach involved 60 semi-structured interviews with stakeholders. Students were often seen as being energetic, having flexible time and having skills associated with their studies. Some organisations, however, viewed students as unreliable, hard to manage and requiring specific programs. Some hosts were viewed as not valuing student volunteers, or not having the capacity to supervise. These perceptions were found to be nuanced. Erroneous myths were seen to develop from a single event, later confirmed by a 'related' event; in scenarios with multiple players, motivations, and complexities. The potential for misconceptions to undermine the true value of student volunteering for all stakeholders is ameliorated when there is common understanding, clear expectation setting, and ongoing dialogue."
4,Antioxidant Status of Rat Liver Mitochondria under Conditions of Moderate Hypothermia of Different Duration,"S I Khizrieva,R A Khalilov,A M Dzhafarova,V R Abdullaev,S I Khizrieva,R A Khalilov,A M Dzhafarova,V R Abdullaev","For evaluation of the contribution of the antioxidant system of mitochondria into the dynamics of changes in the prooxidant status, the content and activity of some of its components were studied under conditions of moderate hypothermia of varying duration. It was found that short-term hypothermia significantly increased superoxide dismutase activity and decreased the levels of low-molecular-weight antioxidants. Increasing the duration of hypothermia to 1 h led to suppression of activities of superoxide dismutase, glutathione reductase, and glutathione peroxidase and a decrease in glutathione content. Further prolongation of hypothermia (to 3 h) was associated with a significant increase in superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase activities and normalization of the rate of glutathione reductase catalysis; the concentration of glutathione increased significantly."
5,Business transformation in an age of turbulence - Lessons learned from COVID-19,"Xishu Li,Maarten Voorneveld,René de Koster,Xishu Li,Maarten Voorneveld,René de Koster","The COVID-19 pandemic has caused global economic turmoil. Although many companies have suffered huge losses, some have flourished by changing their old ways of doing business. We investigate the business transformation process under drastic market changes and time pressure, with a focus on decision speed and structure in the decision & planning phase, the implementation structure and monitoring in the implementation phase, and reinforcement after the implementation. Through case studies in a variety of industries, including manufacturing, e-commerce, and finance, we explore how companies in specific contexts have dealt with the above-mentioned critical factors when transforming their business during the pandemic, whether the experienced transformation processes differ from theory, and if so, how. The examples of business transformations cover eight categories, including work from home, the use of augmented reality, internet of things, and business model redesign. Our findings reveal how these transformations are perceived and evaluated by companies one year into the pandemic. In addition, we show how decision speed, structure of the decision-making process, structure of the implementation process, and scale of the implementation impact the completion time of the transformations. Based on our results, we provide suggestions to companies for an effective business transformation in times of crisis."
6,Ameliorative effects of ribes rubrum oil against gastric ulcers caused by indomethacin in experimental models,"Mohamed Farouk Elsadek,Alyah Almoajel,Mohammed Fawzi Farahat,Mohamed Farouk Elsadek,Alyah Almoajel,Mohammed Fawzi Farahat","The objective of this study was to assess the anti-inflammatory effects of ribes rubrum oil at three different doses (5, 10 and 15 ml/kg b.w/day) in adult male albino rats with indomethacin-induced stomach ulcers (IND). Forty rats (135 ± 5 g) categorized into 5 groups (n = 8), for 45 days. Group (1) normal control, thirty-two rats were gavaged IND as single oral dose (30 mg/Kg b.w) resulted in gastric ulcer, then distributed to four groups, group (2) IND-intoxicated control, Groups 3, 4 and 5 were administrated ribes rubrum oil at levels of (5, 10 & 15 ml/kg b.w) respectively. Administrated levels of ribes rubrum oil found to have remarkable elevation in food conversion efficiency in experimental rats, gastric juice pH, in compared to the drunken control group, gastric prostaglandin E2 and gastric cytochrome P450 reductase levels were lower. The levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines NO, TNF-, and IL-1 were dramatically reduced, which was related with an increase in blood hemoglobin (Hb), packed cell volume (PCV), and red blood cells (RBCs)in ulcerogenic rats compared to intoxicated control. Data showed that, the main components of ribes rubrum oil are β-Pinene, γ-linolenic and Linalool oxide levels (25.9%, 23.10% and 10.5%, respectively) for their antioxidant activity. Findings showed that administrate ribes rubrum oil at dose 15 ml/kg followed by 10 ml/kg had the best results against ulcerogenic rats. In conclusion, the outcomes are consistent with the concept that ribes rubrum oil had a gastroprotective and antisecretory effects against gastric ulcer that may be attributed to the antioxidant properties of the oil that ameliorates the damage occur in gastric of rats."
7,Reconstruction and Exploratory Analysis of mTORC1 Signaling Pathway and Its Applications to Various Diseases Using Network-Based Approach,"Richa Buddham,Sweety Chauhan,Priyanka Narad,Puniti Mathur,Richa Buddham,Sweety Chauhan,Priyanka Narad,Puniti Mathur","Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is a serine-threonine kinase member of the cellular phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway, which is involved in multiple biological functions by transcriptional and translational control. mTOR is a downstream mediator in the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway and plays a critical role in cell survival. In cancer, this pathway can be activated by membrane receptors, including the HER (or ErbB) family of growth factor receptors, the insulin-like growth factor receptor, and the estrogen receptor. In the present work, we congregated an electronic network of mTORC1 built on an assembly of data using natural language processing, consisting of 470 edges (activations/interactions and/or inhibitions) and 206 nodes representing genes/proteins, using the Cytoscape 3.6.0 editor and its plugins for analysis. The experimental design included the extraction of gene expression data related to five distinct types of cancers, namely, pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, hepatic cirrhosis, cervical cancer, glioblastoma, and anaplastic thyroid cancer from Gene Expression Omnibus (NCBI GEO) followed by pre-processing and normalization of the data using R & Bioconductor. ExprEssence plugin was used for network condensation to identify differentially expressed genes across the gene expression samples. Gene Ontology (GO) analysis was performed to find out the over-represented GO terms in the network. In addition, pathway enrichment and functional module analysis of the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network were also conducted. Our results indicated NOTCH1, NOTCH3, FLCN, SOD1, SOD2, NF1, and TLR4 as upregulated proteins in different cancer types highlighting their role in cancer progression. The MCODE analysis identified gene clusters for each cancer type with MYC, PCNA, PARP1, IDH1, FGF10, PTEN, and CCND1 as hub genes with high connectivity. MYC for cervical cancer, IDH1 for hepatic cirrhosis, MGMT for glioblastoma and CCND1 for anaplastic thyroid cancer were identified as genes with prognostic importance using survival analysis."
8,"Distribution, sources and human risk of perfluoroalkyl acids (PFAAs) in a receiving riverine environment of the Nanjing urban area, East China","Dong, Huike; Lu, Guanghua; Yan, Zhenhua; Liu, Jianchao; Yang, Haohan; Zhang, Peng; Jiang, Runren; Bao, Xuhui; Nkoom, Matthew","In recent years, perfluoroalkyl acids (PFAAs) have become ubiquitously distributed in water environments, especially in riverine waters receiving effluents from wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) in urban areas. With rapid economic development, China has become the main market of manufacturing and consuming fluorinated products. While studies concerning PFAAs on dimension of urban water system are scarce. To elucidate the distribution patterns of PFAAs using multi-matrices, the effects of spatial-temporal factors on the partition behaviors of PFAAs were investigated in different riverine environments in the downtown area of Nanjing, East China. Predominated by perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), sum PFAAs ( PFAAs) in the water phase were with concentrations of 0.8(similar to)274.6 ng/L, characteristically higher in the dry season and lower in the wet season. The composition profiles in sediments ( PFAAs 0.8-11.4 ng/g dry weight) differed from that in water, being with a larger proportion of longer-chain PFAAs. The main sources of PFAAs in water were identified as industrial discharge, uncontrolled sewage discharge or WWTP effluents, surface runoff and nonpoint sources. The discharge fluxes of EPFAAs from Nanjing City can reach at 916.5 g/d for the Qinhuai River and 134.1 g/d for WWTPs along the Yangtze River. Fish have been shown to accumulate PFAAs in various tissues, with bioaccumulation positively correlated with perfluoroalkyl chain length. The hazard indexes associated with consumption of river fish were estimated low for Nanjing local population."
9,Serum GDF-15 Predicts In-Hospital Mortality and Arrhythmic Risks in Patients With Acute Myocardial Infarction,"Qiuping Mo,Liuan Zhuo,Zhihong Liao,Rongshan Li,Yu Chen,Jianfang Geng,Qiuping Mo,Liuan Zhuo,Zhihong Liao,Rongshan Li,Yu Chen,Jianfang Geng","This study aims to evaluate the association of serum growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF-15) with in-hospital mortality and arrhythmic risks in patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI). A total of 296 consecutive patients with AMI were enrolled in our hospital from Jan. 2018 to Dec. 2020. Serum GDF-15 levels were measured at baseline. The primary endpoint was in-hospital all-cause mortality, and the secondary endpoint was major adverse cardiac events (MACEs) during hospitalization, defined as a composite of cardiovascular death, heart failure, sustained ventricular arrhythmias (ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation), and bleeding. During hospitalization, patients with a higher GDF-15 level had significantly higher incidences of in-hospital mortality (7.4% vs 1.4%; P = .02) and MACEs (9.5% vs 20.9%, P < .01) than those with a lower GDF-15 level. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that a higher GDF-15 level was significantly associated with increased risks of in-hospital mortality (OR = 1.92, 95% CI: 1.44-2.50; P < .01) and MACEs (OR = 2.19, 95% CI: 1.56-2.77; P < .01). In conclusion, GDF-15 was associated with the risks of in-hospital mortality and MACEs, indicating that it should be a prognostic biomarker for patients with AMI."
10,The Economic Perspective of Food Poverty and (In)security: An Analytical Approach to Measuring and Estimation in Italy,"Stefano Marchetti,Luca Secondi,Stefano Marchetti,Luca Secondi","The UN Sustainable Development Goals have set clear targets on global poverty, hunger and malnutrition to be achieved by 2030, which have prompted academics and policymakers to identify useful strategies and drivers. Moreover, the COVID19 pandemic has exacerbated inequalities at national and sub-national levels thus hampering the achievement of these goals. On considering the multifaceted nature of poverty, a recent research strand focuses on food poverty and insecurity issues in terms of economic access to food and healthy diet consumption, with moderate and extreme food insecurity affecting almost 9% of the population in Europe and North America. This paper aims to analyse food poverty and insecurity at regional level in Italy. Using micro-data from the Italian Household Budget Survey carried out by ISTAT, an analytical approach was proposed to define and measure the different degree of food poverty and insecurity. Moreover, to obtain insights into whether food poverty and insecurity can afford population healthy nutrition, inequality of the distributions of food expenditure categories are estimated. The results provided us with information on other important aspects of the poverty. Indeed, in Italy individuals who are at-risk-of-food-poverty or food insecure amount to 22.3% of the entire population. Furthermore, the at-risk-of-food-poverty-rate varies at regional level from 14.6% (Umbria) to 29.6% (Abruzzo), with high levels of food consumption inequalities observed above all for vegetables, meat and fish. All these issues could help policy makers to define economic intervention policies aimed at reducing social exclusion and achieving more equitable and sustainable living conditions for the entire population."
11,Smart meter data-driven evaluation of operational demand response potential of residential air conditioning loads,"Qi, Ning; Cheng, Lin; Xu, Helin; Wu, Kuihua; Li, XuLiang; Wang, Yanshuo; Liu, Rui","Residential air conditioning loads (ACLs) are promising demand response (DR) resources with a certain flexibility and controllability that can enhance the operational flexibility and resource utilization of the power grid. The evaluation of DR potential is of great importance for estimating the power reduction, targeting appropriate DR customers, and obtaining constrained boundary for economic dispatch. To better reveal the multi-faceted factors and multi-uncertainties during DR, this paper present a novel definition and evaluation approach of operational DR potential from single customer to large-scale load centers. Aimed at resolving two main issues of evaluation: disaggregation of ACLs component and parameter estimation, an unsupervised load decomposition methodology considering load level difference and seasonal variation is proposed to disaggregate the whole-house energy consumption into ACLs and baseload components non-intrusively. Subsequently, based on the thermal dynamics model of ACLs, a segment analysis methodology is developed, including a constrained regression method for the static parameter estimation and a hybrid method for the dynamic parameter estimation. Data experiments based on ground truth data of residential customers in Austin, Texas, U.S., smart homes in Western Massachusetts and low voltage area in a developed city, Jiangsu province, China, validate the better performance of accuracy and robustness using the proposed methods. The proposed methods are further implemented to four application scenarios, including ACLs consumption behavior learning, operational DR potential analysis, customers targeting for different time-scale DR programs, and day ahead scheduling. These results also demonstrate that great difference in terms of ACLs usage patterns (a total of 19 patterns), DR potential (a maximum of 0.7 kW) results from different DR duration and operational conditions. The DR programs designers and load aggregators are suggested to consider the proposed 5 basic indicators to target customer and select participants in different DR scenarios. And the operational DR potential is more reliable and suitable to generate strategies for day ahead scheduling."
12,"Modelling environmental degradation in South Africa: the effects of energy consumption, democracy, and globalization using innovation accounting tests","Usman, Ojonugwa; Olanipekun, Ifedolapo O.; Iorember, Paul Terhemba; Abu-Goodman, Maryam","This study investigates the effects of energy consumption, democracy and globalization on environmental degradation in the context of the environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) for South Africa between 1971 and 2014. To this end, the study applies the combined Bayer-Hanck cointegration test and the fully modified ordinary least squares (FM-OLS) estimation approach. The empirical results confirm the presence of cointegration among the variables, and thus validate the EKC hypothesis for South Africa. In addition, while energy consumption increases environmental degradation, the effect of democracy is positively insignificant. The finding also suggests that globalization condenses environmental degradation. The results of the long-run causal relationship divulge that economic growth, energy consumption, democracy and globalization Granger-cause environmental degradation. The results also find causality running from CO2 emissions, economic growth, democracy and globalization to energy consumption. In the short run, a causality is found running from globalization to CO2 emissions, energy consumption to CO2 emissions and globalization to energy consumption. In addition, economic growth is said to Granger-cause democracy while democracy Granger-causes CO2 emissions. These results are validated by the innovation accounting tests."
13,Energy Management Strategy in Dynamic Distribution Network Reconfiguration Considering Renewable Energy Resources and Storage,"Azizivahed, Ali; Arefi, Ali; Ghavidel, Sahand; Shafie-khah, Miadreza; Li, Li; Zhang, Jiangfeng; Catalao, Joao P. S.","Penetration of renewable energy sources (RESs) and electrical energy storage (EES) systems in distribution systems is increasing, and it is crucial to investigate their impact on systems' operation scheme, reliability, and security. In this paper, expected energy not supplied (EENS) and voltage stability index (VSI) of distribution networks are investigated in dynamic balanced and unbalanced distribution network reconfiguration, including RESs and EES systems. Furthermore, due to the high investment cost of the EES systems, the number of charge and discharge is limited, and the state-of-health constraint is included in the underlying problem to prolong the lifetime of these facilities. The optimal charging/discharging scheme for EES systems and optimal distribution network topology are presented in order to optimize the operational costs, and reliability and security indices simultaneously. The proposed strategy is applied to a large-scale 119-bus distribution test network in order to show the economic justification of the proposed approach."
14,Axin2+ PDL Cells Directly Contribute to New Alveolar Bone Formation in Response to Orthodontic Tension Force,"K Wang,C Xu,X Xie,Y Jing,P J Chen,S Yadav,Z Wang,R W Taylor,J Wang,J Q Feng,K Wang,C Xu,X Xie,Y Jing,P J Chen,S Yadav,Z Wang,R W Taylor,J Wang,J Q Feng","Wnt-β-catenin signaling plays a key role in orthodontic tooth movement (OTM), a common clinical practice for malocclusion correction. However, its targeted periodontal ligament (PDL) progenitor cells remain largely unclear. In this study, we first showed a synchronized increase in Wnt-β-catenin levels and Axin2+ PDL progenitor cell numbers during OTM using immunostaining of β-catenin in wild-type mice and X-gal staining in the Axin2-LacZ knock-in line. Next, we demonstrated time-dependent increases in Axin2+ PDL progenitors and their progeny cell numbers within PDL and alveolar bones during OTM using a one-time tamoxifen-induced Axin2 tracing line (Axin2CreERT2/+; R26RtdTomato/+). Coimmunostaining images displayed both early and late bone markers (such as RUNX2 and DMP1) in the Axin2Lin PDL cells. Conversely, ablation of Axin2+ PDL cells via one-time tamoxifen-induced diphtheria toxin subunit A (DTA) led to a drastic decrease in osteogenic activity (as reflected by alkaline phosphatase) in PDL and alveolar bone. There was also a decrease in new bone mass and a significant reduction in the mineral apposition rate on both the control side (to a moderate degree) and the OTM side (to a severe degree). Thus, we conclude that the Axin2+ PDL cells (the Wnt-targeted key cells) are highly sensitive to orthodontic tension force and play a critical role in OTM-induced PDL expansion and alveolar bone formation. Future drug development targeting the Axin2+ PDL progenitor cells may accelerate alveolar bone formation during orthodontic treatment."
15,Research on the incorporation of untreated flue gas desulfurization gypsum into magnesium oxysulfate cement,"Gu, Kang; Chen, Bing","The growing concern of low-carbon economy and sustainable development has obliged the researchers to investigate green building materials through utilizing industrial by-products. In this study, the industrial waste material, flue gas desulfurization gypsum (FGDG), is incorporated into the magnesium oxysulfate cement (MOSC). The performance of FGDG-incorporated MOSC is evaluated by testing the setting time, compressive strength, density, water absorption, water resistance, volume stability and SO42- releasing. The hydration products are detected by X-ray diffraction, while microstructure is observed by optical microscope and scanning electron microscope. Increasing the proportion of FGDG retards the initial and final setting times of paste. Compressive strength for MOSC mixtures varies from 52.4 to 62.4 MPa at hydration age of 3 days. The water absorption and the release of SO42- increase when increasing the FGDG content. The FGDG-incorporated MOSC presents a superior water resistance and volume stability in contrast with the FGDG-free MOSC. The main hydration products of the paste are Mg(OH)(2) and 5 Mg(OH)(2)center dot MgSO4 center dot 7H(2)O (5.1.7) phase. The microstructure analysis is in agreement with the results of mechanical properties. Finally, the FGDG-incorporated MOSC is identified as a promising building material by the evaluation of economic and environmental sustainability. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."
16,Exploring indicators of circular economy adoption framework through a hybrid decision support approach,"Yadav, Gunjan; Mangla, Sachin Kumar; Bhattacharya, Arijit; Luthra, Sunil","Circular economy (CE) focuses on a circular approach to energy and material resources, which provides economic, environmental and social benefits for manufacturing organisations. CE adoption in emerging economies facilitates in substantial economic growth through appropriate utilisation of energy and material resources across manufacturing industries. This study identifies CE indicators in the context of an emerging economy. The study further develops a framework for the adoption of CE and tests it through a hybrid Best Worst Method and Decision-Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory approach. The framework is validated through an Indian manufacturing case organisation. While Best Worst Method computes the CE related indicator weights, Decision-Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory analyses the inter-relationship among indicators. Disparate CE related indicators, e.g. strategic, managerial, informational and technological, supply chain and organisational, influence the CE adoption in an emerging economy context. The findings reveal that the strategic and managerial indicators have the strongest influence on developing other indicators. The causal digraph and relationship diagram assist the practitioners in predicting the inter-relationship of indicators in CE adoption. The study outcomes will help the practitioners, policymakers and researchers to draw a framework for adoption of circular and green practices and usage of resources sustainably.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of the deadly disease, relies on the non-structural protein Nsp1 for multiplication within the host cells and disarms the host immune defences by various mechanisms. Herein, we investigated the potential of artemisinin and its derivatives as possible inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 Nsp1 through various computational approaches. Molecular docking results show that artemisinin (CID68827) binds to Nsp1 with a binding energy of -6.53 kcal/mol and an inhibition constant of 16.43 µM. The top 3 derivatives Artesunate (CID6917864), Artemiside (CID53323323) and Artemisone (CID11531457) show binding energies of -7.92 kcal/mol, -7.46 kcal/mol and -7.36 kcal/mol respectively. Hydrophobic interactions and hydrogen bonding with Val10, Arg11, and Gln50 helped to stabilize the protein-ligand complexes. The pharmacokinetic properties of these molecules show acceptable properties. The geometric parameters derived from large-scale MD simulation studies provided insights into the changes in the structural topology of Nsp1 upon binding of Artesunate. Thus, the findings of our research highlight the importance of artemisinin and its derivatives in the development of drugs to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 Nsp1 protein."

Despite recent advances of nanopore-based membranes, which have revitalized the prospect of blue energy, their energy conversion is hampered by nanomembrane issues such as high internal resistance or low selectivity. Herein, we report a lamellar-structured membrane made of nanoporous Ti3C2Tx MXene sheets, exhibiting simultaneous enhancement in permeability and ion selectivity beyond their inherent trade-off. The perforated nanopores formed by facile H2SO4 oxidation of the sheets act as a network of cation channels that interconnects interplanar nanocapillaries throughout the lamellar membrane. The constructed internal nanopores lower the energy barrier for cation passage, thereby boosting the preferential ion diffusion across the membrane. A maximum output power density of the nanoporous Ti3C2Tx MXene membranes reaches up to 17.5 W·m-2 under a 100-fold KCl gradient at neutral pH and room temperature, which is as high as by 38% compared to that of the pristine membrane. The membrane design strategy employing the nanoporous two-dimensional sheets provides a promising approach for ion exchange, osmotic energy extraction, and other nanofluidic applications."
19,"A Novel, eco-friendly combined solar cooling and heating system, powered by hybrid Photovoltaic thermal (PVT) collector for domestic application","Zarei, Ahmad; Liravi, Mohammad; Rabiee, Marzie Babaie; Ghodrat, Maryam","Solar heating and cooling technologies can have a vital role to play in understanding the targets in energy security, economic development, and mitigating climate change. This study aimed to investigate the performance of the combined solar cooling/heating system using a Photovoltaic Thermal collector (PVT) for residential applications. The main advantage of using PVT is the conversion of the maximum amount of solar energy into electricity and thermal energy. In this work, water is used to cool the panel and, consequently, increase the efficiency. The cooling cycle comprises a hybrid ejector-compression refrigeration cycle with two evaporator temperatures. To reduce the effect of the global warming phenomenon, two different refrigerants with lower Global Warming Potential (GWP), such as R600a and R290, are used instead of R134a. The inlet water does not only gain heat from the PVT but also the collector output water is heated in a condenser and heater. The results indicate that increasing the water mass flow rate from 0.011 kg/s to 0.03 kg/s (39-108 Lit/h) at solar intensity (G) of 945 W/m(2) results in enhancing the overall efficiency of the PVT system from 66.7% to 75.8%. In terms of the highest Coefficient of performance (COP) and the lowest exergy destruction, R290 shows better performance comparing to the other refrigerants. In more details, using R290, instead of R134a, results in up to 7.5% enhancement in the COP of the cycle. The water mass flow rate is optimized at m(w)=0.013 kg/s to achieve the highest COP and the lowest exergy destruction. Also, it is reported that the temperature of the outlet water from the system varies between 31.72 degrees C to 46.73 degrees C during the day. Finally, it is revealed that using R290 for the refrigeration cycle and cooling the panel result in enhancing the COP of the cycle by 11.1%, increasing the temperature of the outlet water from the system by 9.17 degrees C and decreasing the refrigerant flow rate by 60.17%, in comparison with a system without panel cooling which uses R134a refrigerant."
20,"Host phenotype and microbiome vary with infection status, parasite genotype, and parasite microbiome composition","Megan A Hahn,Agnes Piecyk,Fátima Jorge,Robert Cerrato,Martin Kalbe,Nolwenn M Dheilly,Megan A Hahn,Agnes Piecyk,Fátima Jorge,Robert Cerrato,Martin Kalbe,Nolwenn M Dheilly","A growing literature demonstrates the impact of helminths on their host gut microbiome. We investigated whether the stickleback host microbiome depends on ecoevolutionary variables by testing the impact of exposure to the cestode parasite Schistocephalus solidus with respect to infection success, host genotype, parasite genotype, and parasite microbiome composition. We observed constitutive differences in the microbiome of sticklebacks of different origin, and those differences increased when sticklebacks exposed to the parasite resisted infection. In contrast, the microbiome of successfully infected sticklebacks varied with parasite genotype. More specifically, we revealed that the association between microbiome and immune gene expression increased in infected individuals and varied with parasite genotype. In addition, we showed that S. solidus hosts a complex endomicrobiome and that bacterial abundance in the parasite correlates with expression of host immune genes. Within this comprehensive analysis we demonstrated that (i) parasites contribute to modulating the host microbiome through both successful and unsuccessful infection, (ii) when infection is successful, the host microbiome varies with parasite genotype due to genotype-dependent variation in parasite immunomodulation, and (iii) the parasite-associated microbiome is distinct from its host and impacts the host immune response to infection."
21,"Systematic review on activity of liposomal encapsulated antioxidant, antibiotics, and antiviral agents","Reshna K R,Preetha Balakrishnan,Sreerag Gopi,Reshna K R,Preetha Balakrishnan,Sreerag Gopi","Reactive oxygen species (ROS) like superoxide anion, hydrogen peroxide, and hydroxyl radical, can be formed as normal products of aerobic metabolism. Overproduction or insufficient removal of ROS results in significant damage to cell structure and functions. Antioxidants applied directly and at relatively high concentrations to cellular systems are effective in protection against the damaging actions of ROS. Microorganisms including Gram-positive and negative bacteria, fungi, protozoa, algae, etc., can be disease causing microorganism. Antimicrobial agents have the capability to inhibitor destroy the microorganisms. The problems arising from the use of antioxidant and antimicrobial agents include poor solubility, instability during storage, low bioavailability, and difficulty to reach target organs with sufficient doses. Liposomal antimicrobial agent and liposomal antioxidants enhance the solubility, bioavailability, and stability of antimicrobial agent and antioxidants."
22,The Impact of Population Aging and Public Health Support on EU Labor Markets,"Cristea, Mirela; Noja, Gratiela Georgiana; Stefea, Petru; Sala, Adrian Lucian","Population aging and public health expenditure mainly dedicated to older dependent persons present major challenges for the European Union (EU) Member States, with profound implications for their economies and labor markets. Sustainable economic development relies on a well-balanced workforce of young and older people. As this balance shifts in favor of older people, productivity tends to suffer, on the one hand, and the older group demands more from health services, on the other hand. These requisites tend to manifest differently within developed and developing EU countries. This research aimed to assess population aging impacts on labor market coordinates (employment rate, labor productivity), in the framework of several health dimensions (namely, health government expenditure, hospital services, healthy life years, perceived health) and other economic and social factors. The analytical approach consisted of applying structural equation models, Gaussian graphical models, and macroeconometric models (robust regression and panel corrected standard errors) to EU panel data for the years 1995-2017. The results show significant dissimilarities between developed and developing EU countries, suggesting the need for specific policies and strategies for the labor market integration of older people, jointly with public health expenditure, with implications for EU labor market performance."
23,Peer-to-peer electricity trading in grid-connected residential communities with household distributed photovoltaic,"Li, Zhenpeng; Ma, Tao","With the rapid development of distributed electricity generation technologies such as solar photovoltaics, peer to-peer (P2P) electricity trading is attracting incremental attention due to the pursuit of decentralized energy autonomy and further economic benefits. The study presented in this paper aims to gain a better understanding of the community P2P electricity trading, including influence of trading strategies, determinants of trading quantity and price, and further factors affecting improvement in community energy welfare. The market mechanism is determined based on the discriminatory continuous double auction, followed by simulations of the trading process in well-designed cases. Results show that P2P trading price and quantity depend on variation of the supply-demand ratio during each trading period, by which in the absence of complex trading strategies and learning abilities, profits are able to be effectively and fairly allocated among participants. For a given community, the total profits that could be obtained from P2P electricity trading are influenced by many factors, and the key is to make those ""ineffective supply"" available in the P2P market again, through active energy management solutions on all residents rather than focusing only on prosumers' self-consumption in the past. The ensuing results make significant sense as regards better understanding both the benefits and limitations of P2P electricity trading in residential communities or other similar scenes, thus helping for guiding practical implementation."
24,Associations Between Atrial Arrhythmias and Brain Amyloid Deposition: The ARIC-PET Study,"Michelle C Johansen,Wendy Wang,Michael J Zhang,Alvaro Alonso,Dean F Wong,Rebecca F Gottesman,Lin Y Chen,Michelle C Johansen,Wendy Wang,Michael J Zhang,Alvaro Alonso,Dean F Wong,Rebecca F Gottesman,Lin Y Chen","The aim of this study is to determine if there is an association between atrial arrhythmias and brain amyloid-β (Aβ), measured on florbetapir (FBP) PET. 346 nondemented participants from the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities study underwent FBP-PET, 185 also wore Zio® XT Patch. The associations between global cortical Aβ (> 1.2 standardized uptake value ratio) and history of atrial fibrillation, zio-defined atrial tachycardia and premature atrial contractions, each, were evaluated. Among nondemented community-dwelling older adults, we did not find an association between atrial arrhythmias and Aβ. Other brain pathology may underlie the association described between atrial arrhythmias and cognition."
25,An Efficient and Convenient Method for Isolation and Culturing of Neonatal Rat Cardiomyocytes,"J Liang,S Su,S Chen,J Feng,J Liang,S Su,S Chen,J Feng","For isolation of neonatal rat cardiomyocytes (NRCM) the ventricular muscles of neonatal rats were treated with different digestive solutions: 0.06% trypsin (method I), 0.08% collagenase II (method II), 0.06% trypsin and 0.08% collagenase II for stepwise digestion (methods III and IV). After enzymatic dissociation of the tissue, the complete medium was added to stop this process. The cells suspensions obtained by methods I-III were collected and centrifuged. In contrast, the novel and improved method IV did not use centrifugation. Instead, various methods of adhesion were employed to separate non-myocardial cells. The isolation methods were compared by the quantity, survival rate, morphology, spontaneous pulsation rate, purity, and vitality of NRCM. These assessments showed that isolation method IV is a simple, efficient, and convenient way to obtain NRCM for culturing."

We carry out a truth value judgment task to measure children's interpretations of the Spanish existential quantifier algunos in implicature-consistent and implicature-inconsistent contexts. Independently, we take measures of children's inhibition, working memory, attention, approximate number ability, phrasal syntax, and lexicon. We model the interplay of these variables using a piecewise structural equation model (SEM), common in the life sciences, but not in the social and behavioral sciences. By 6 years of age, the children in our sample were not statistically different from adults in their interpretations. Syntax, lexicon, and inhibition significantly predict implicature generation, each accounting for unique variance. The approximate number system and inhibition significantly predict lexical development. The statistical power of the piecewise SEM components, with a sample of 64 children, is high, in comparison to a traditional, globally estimated SEM of the same data."

While the percentage of survivors to hospital admission has increased over the years, the percentage of survivors to hospital discharge and the number of patients with good neurological recovery can be greatly improved. This underscores the urgent need to focus on 'post-cardiac arrest care', the fifth link in the chain of survival, to improve the outcomes of patients who are admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) after return of spontaneous circulation. This review builds on earlier recommendations of the Singapore National Targeted Temperature Management Workgroup in 2017 to provide a focused update on post-cardiac arrest management and a practical guide for physicians managing resuscitated patients with cardiac arrest in the ICU."

The complexity of the brain, the blood-brain barrier influencing a multitude of parameters/biomarkers, as well as numerous other factors involved often contribute to the decline in the chances of treatment success. Development of the new drug moiety also takes time, being necessary to consider both its toxicity and related issues. As a strategic plan, a combined strategy is being developed and considered to address AD pathology using several approaches. A combination of vitamin E, quercetin, and basil oil in a nano-based formulation is designed to be administered nasally. The antioxidant present in these natural-based products helps to treat and alleviate AD if a synergistic approach is considered. The three active substances mentioned above are well known for the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders. The nanoformulation helps the co-delivery of the drug moiety to the brain through the intranasal route. In this review, a correlation and use of vitamin E, quercetin, and basil oil in a nano-based formulation is described as an effective way to treat AD. The intranasal administration of drugs is a promising approach for the treatment of neurodegenerative and mental disorders, as this route is non-invasive, enhances the bioavailability, allows a drug dose reduction, bypasses the blood-brain barrier, and reduces the systemic undesired effect. The use of natural products is generally considered to be just as safe; therefore, by using this combined approach, the level of toxicity can be minimized."
29,A mathematical model of the rat kidney. IV. Whole kidney response to hyperkalemia,"Alan M Weinstein,Alan M Weinstein","The renal response to acute hyperkalemia is mediated by increased K+ secretion within the connecting tubule (CNT), flux that is modulated by tubular effects (e.g., aldosterone) in conjunction with increased luminal flow. There is ample evidence that peritubular K+ blunts Na+ reabsorption in the proximal tubule, thick ascending Henle limb, and distal convoluted tubule (DCT). Although any such reduction may augment CNT delivery, the relative contribution of each is uncertain. The kidney model of this laboratory was recently advanced with representation of the cortical labyrinth and medullary ray. Model tubules capture the impact of hyperkalemia to blunt Na+ reabsorption within each upstream segment. However, this forces the question of the extent to which increased Na+ delivery is transmitted past the macula densa and its tubuloglomerular feedback (TGF) signal. Beyond increasing macula densa Na+ delivery, peritubular K+ is predicted to raise cytosolic Cl- and depolarize macula densa cells, which may also activate TGF. Thus, although the upstream reduction in Na+ transport may be larger, it appears that the DCT effect is critical to increasing CNT delivery. Beyond the flow effect, hyperkalemia reduces ammoniagenesis and reduced ammoniagenesis enhances K+ excretion. What this model provides is a possible mechanism. When cortical [Formula: see text] is taken up via peritubular Na+-K+([Formula: see text])-ATPase, it acidifies principal cells. Consequently, reduced ammoniagenesis increases principal cell pH, thereby increasing conductance of both the epithelial Na+ channel and renal outer medullary K+ channel, enhancing K+ excretion. In this model, the effect of aldosterone on principal cells, diminished DCT Na+ reabsorption, and reduced ammoniagenesis all provide relatively equal and additive contributions to renal K+ excretion.NEW & NOTEWORTHY Hyperkalemia blunts Na+ reabsorption along the nephron, and increased CNT Na+ delivery facilitates K+ secretion. The model suggests that tubuloglomerular feedback limits transmission of proximal effects past the macula densa, so that it is DCT transport that is critical. Hyperkalemia also reduces PCT ammoniagenesis, which enhances K+ excretion. The model suggests a mechanism, namely, that reduced cortical ammonia impacts CNT transport by raising cell pH and thus increasing both ENaC and ROMK conductance."

Genome sequences revealed that this species possesses some GH18 chitinases and AA10 protein(s); however, these enzymes have not been experimentally characterized. In this work, three genes were identified from the genomic DNA of this bacterium and cloned in Escherichia coli. Sequence analysis exhibited that the ORF of chiA consists of 1,203 bp and encodes deduced 45.46 kDa-chitinase A of 400 aa. The domain structure of chitinase A is composed of a CBM 50 domain at the N-terminus and a catalytic domain at the C-terminus. The ORF of chiB includes 1,263 bp and encodes deduced 47.59 kDa-chitinase B of 420 aa. Chitinase B consists of two CBM50 domains at the N-terminus and a catalytic domain at the C-terminus. The ORF of lpmo10 is 621 bp and encodes a deduced 22.44 kDa-AA10 protein, BvLPMO10 of 206 aa. BvLPMO10 contains a signal peptide and an AA10 catalytic domain. Chitinases A and B were grouped into subfamily A of family 18 chitinases. Amino acid sequences in their catalytic domains lack aromatic residues (Trp, Phe, Tyr) probably involved in processivity and substrate binding compared with well-known bacterial GH18 chitinases. chiB was successfully expressed in E. coli. Purified rBvChiB degraded insoluble chitin and was responsible for inhibition of fungal spore-germination and egg hatching of plant-parasitic nematode. This is the first report describing the analysis of the chitinase system from B. velezensis."

Recently, the development of several vaccines to COVID-19 has been accompanied by reports of an associated rare syndrome of thrombosis and thrombocytopaenia (VITTS). The possibility of this rare disorder confronts all clinicians who deal with acute thrombosis, particularly given the prevalence of patients who have recently been immunised. However, VITTS remains rare, and we believe unnecessary focus on its potential diagnosis may distract from other more common causes of acute thrombosis.

Based on the market prices of fertilizers, the economic value of the digestate has been assessed. For a selected biogas plant, the economic balance has been calculated, taking into account the income resulting from the sale of the digestate. The results obtained allow for stating that samples of digestate were rich in nitrogen (up to 6.58 g kg(-1)), and potassium (up to 16.3 g kg(-1)) in fresh matter (FM). The value of the digestate for installations was estimated in the range of 6.08-15.36 EUR.Mg-1. The analysis for one of the 1MW biogas plants shows that under current conditions of supporting systems, the daily income for a biogas plant is 1,414 EUR and the digestate produced is worth another 334.4 EUR. Its application, especially on fields adjacent to biogas plants, is part of the principle of nutrient recovery in the circular economy. (c) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."
35,The political economy of coal in Poland: Drivers and barriers for a shift away from fossil fuels,"Brauers, Hanna; Oei, Pao-Yu","Poland is the largest hard coal and second largest lignite producer in the EU, generating around 80 percent of its electricity from coal. Resistance to a reduction in coal production and consumption comes from various actors, namely, coal corporations, unions, parts of civil society and the government - as well as their coalitions. Their opposition centres around the prospect of losing their business, past negative experiences with structural change, fears of rising energy prices and energy security concerns, as well as potential unemployment in regions almost entirely dependent on coal. This paper identifies key political and economic drivers and barriers of a reduction in coal production and consumption in Poland using the Triple Embeddedness Framework. Uneconomic coal mining, unavoidable energy infrastructure investments, rising air pollution levels and pressure from the European Union might provide new political momentum for a shift away from coal in line with international climate targets. However, results show that to achieve political feasibility, policies targeting a reduction in coal production and use need to be implemented jointly with social and structural policy measures, addressing a just transition for the affected regions in line with the vision of a 'European Green Deal'."
36,Coordinated wind-thermal-energy storage offering strategy in energy and spinning reserve markets using a multi-stage model,"Khaloie, Hooman; Abdollahi, Amir; Shafie-khah, Miadreza; Anvari-Moghaddam, Amjad; Nojavan, Sayyad; Siano, Pierluigi; Catalao, Joao P. S.","Renewable energy resources such as wind, either individually or integrated with other resources, are widely considered in different power system studies, especially self-scheduling and offering strategy problems. In the current paper, a three-stage stochastic multi-objective offering framework based on mixed-integer programming formulation for a wind-thermal-energy storage generation company in the energy and spinning reserve markets is proposed. The commitment decisions of dispatchable energy sources, the offering curves of the generation company in the energy and spinning reserve markets, and dealing with energy deviations in the balancing market are the decisions of the proposed three-stage offering strategy problem, respectively. In the suggested methodology, the participation model of the energy storage system in the spinning reserve market extends to both charging and discharging modes. The proposed framework concurrently maximizes generation company's expected profit and minimizes the expected emission of thermal units applying lexicographic optimization and hybrid augmented-weighted is an element of-constraint method. In this regard, the uncertainties associated with imbalance prices and wind power output as well as day-ahead energy and spinning reserve market prices are modeled via a set of scenarios. Eventually, two different strategies, i.e., a preference-based approach and emission trading pattern, are utilized to select the most favored solution among Pareto optimal solutions. Numerical results reveal that taking advantage of spinning reserve market alongside with energy market will substantially increase the profitability of the generation company. Also, the results disclose that spinning reserve market is more lucrative than the energy market for the energy storage system in the offering strategy structure."

For environment quality assessment, data envelopment analysis (DEA) is used to assess the data cover the period from 2013 to 2017. In this study, primary energy consumption (PEC) and population are two basic inputs along with gross domestic product (GDP) and carbon dioxide emissions that are desirable and undesirable outputs, respectively. The practical outcomes illustrate that Brunei, Australia, Singapore, and Hong Kong are the most effective and efficient states for the 5 years periods (2013-2017) in terms of energy efficiency and to reduce emission of carbon dioxide. In addition, other states in the OECD region shows greater economic proficiency than environmental proficiency. Furthermore, the results shows that energy efficiency has strong bonding with carbon emissions; however there is a weaker association between economic environmental efficiency. Thus, the attainment of optimal level of energy efficiency could be more pivotal than economic efficiency to improve environmental efficiency in countries from the OECD region."
38,Total Knee Arthroplasty for Osteoarthritis in a Patient with Nail Patella Syndrome - A Case Report,"Antonio Filipe Serrano,Pedro Manuel Serrano,Antonio Filipe Serrano,Pedro Manuel Serrano","Hereditary osteo-onychodysplasia (or nail patella syndrome) is a rare autosomal dominant disease defined by an association of severe characteristics, with a classic clinical tetrad of dysplasia of the fingernails, patellar hypoplasia or absence, presence of iliac horns, and deformities of the elbow, although renal, ocular and neurological involvement may also be present. The main orthopedic complaint of these patients is patellar instability associated with pain and functional limitation. Most of the literature regarding the treatment of NPS-related patellar problems, concerns pediatric population and there is no treatment algorithm defined for adult patients. NPS has a wide range of presentations in skeletally mature patients, and its severity is also very variable. The general practitioner should be familiar with NPS's clinical presentation spectrum, and the orthopedic surgeon with treatment options, in order to provide the most adequate treatment for each patient. Although there is no cure for NPS, several treatments have been useful in the symptomatic treatment of changes in the knees. We describe a rare clinical case of a 47-year-old female patient with NPS who underwent total knee arthroplasty for knee osteoarthritis."
39,Recent developments in the passive and hybrid thermal management techniques of lithium -ion batteries,"Patel, Jay R.; Rathod, Manish K.","The main obstacle in the transition from petrol/diesel vehicles to electric vehicles (EVs) is the performance of power battery. The widely used lithium-ion battery is highly sensitive to the temperature, which affects the performance, lifespan, and safety of the battery. Hence, the proper battery thermal management system (BTMS) is necessary with EVs. BTMS can reduce the negative influence of the temperature by decreasing the maximum battery temperature and temperature difference inside the battery. This article reviews various battery thermal management systems and categorized as active and passive systems. The major focus of the review is on passive BTMS using phase change material (PCM) and heat pipe. The results show that PCM and heat pipe based BTMS can provide better thermal management without any power consumption. Further, the hybrid BTMS with the combination of active/passive is presented, and the research results show that hybrid BTMS can provide better thermal management compared to single BTMS. The BTMS is statistically reviewed in terms of maximum battery temperature and temperature difference, and percentage improvement using BTMS is also provided. This article provides direction towards the development of practical and economic BTMS for with limited power consumption, volume, and weight constraints."
40,Reconsidering the function of the xyloglucan endotransglucosylase/hydrolase family,"Konan Ishida,Ryusuke Yokoyama,Konan Ishida,Ryusuke Yokoyama","Plants possess an outer cell layer called the cell wall. This matrix comprises various molecules, such as polysaccharides and proteins, and serves a wide array of physiologically important functions. This structure is not static but rather flexible in response to the environment. One of the factors responsible for this plasticity is the xyloglucan endotransglucosylase/hydrolase (XTH) family, which cleaves and reconnects xyloglucan molecules. Since xyloglucan molecules have been hypothesised to tether cellulose microfibrils forming the main load-bearing network in the primary cell wall, XTHs have been thought to play a central role in cell wall loosening for plant cell expansion. However, multiple lines of recent evidence have questioned this classic model. Nevertheless, reverse genetic analyses have proven the biological importance of XTHs; therefore, a major challenge at present is to reconsider the role of XTHs in planta. Recent advances in analytical techniques have allowed for gathering rich information on the structure of the primary cell wall. Thus, the integration of accumulated knowledge in current XTH studies may offer a turning point for unveiling the precise functions of XTHs. In the present review, we redefine the biological function of the XTH family based on the recent architectural model of the cell wall. We highlight three key findings regarding this enzyme family: (1) XTHs are not strictly required for cell wall loosening during plant cell expansion but play vital roles in response to specific biotic or abiotic stresses; (2) in addition to their transglycosylase activity, the hydrolase activity of XTHs is involved in physiological benefits; and (3) XTHs can recognise a wide range of polysaccharides other than xyloglucans."
41,The effects of carbon disulfide driven functionalization on graphene oxide for enhanced Pb(II) adsorption: Investigation of adsorption mechanism,"Lian, Qiyu; Ahmad, Zaki Uddin; Gang, Daniel Dianchen; Zappi, Mark E.; Fortela, Dhan Lord B.; Hernandez, Rafael","The surface properties of graphene oxide (GO) have been identified as the key effects on the adsorption of Pb(II) from aqueous solutions in this study. This study reveals the effect of the surface reactivity of GO via Carbon Disulfide (CS2) functionalization for Pb(II) adsorption. After successfully preparing CS2 functionalized GO (GOCS), the specific techniques were applied to investigate Pb(II) adsorption onto GOCS. Results indicated that the new sulfur-containing functional groups incorporated onto GOCS significantly enhanced Pb(II) adsorption capacity on GOCS than that of GO, achieving an improvement of 31% in maximum adsorption capacity increasing from 292.8 to 383.4 mg g(-1). The equilibrium adsorption capacity for GOCS was 280.2 mg g(-1) having an improvement of 83.2% over that of 152.97 mg g(-1) for GO at the same initial concentration of 150 mg L-1 under the optimal pH of 5.7. Moreover, the results of adsorption experiments showed an excellent fit to the Langmuir and Pseudo-Second-Order models indicating the monolayer and chemical adsorption, respectively. The mechanism for Pb(II) adsorption on GOCS was proposed as the coordination, electrostatic interactions, cation-pi interactions, and Lewis acidbase interactions. The regeneration study showed that GOCS had an appreciable reusability for Pb(II) adsorption with the adsorption capacity of 208.92 mg g(-1) after five regeneration cycles. In summary, GOCS has been proved to be a novel, useful, and potentially economic adsorbent for the high-efficiency removal of Pb(II) from aqueous solutions. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Rats were exposed to 7 Gy of γ-rays and then injected intraperitoneally (i.p) with ZnCoNPs [2U/rat/day (5 mg/kg)] and ZnCaNPs [2U/rat/day (15 mg/kg)] for 7 consecutive days. The results showed that irradiated rats treated with ZnCoNPs (5 mg/kg/body weight) in combination with ZnCaNPs (15 mg/kg/body weight) for 7 days had a significant increases in body weight, antioxidant levels, T helper cell 4 (cluster of differentiation 4 (CD4)), and T cytotoxic cell 8 (cluster of differentiation 8 (CD8)), associated with a marked decrease in lipid peroxidation (LP), nitric oxide(NOx), total free radicals concentrate (TFRC), and DNA fragmentation. There were positive alterations in the morphological state, hematological parameters and the cell cycle phases. Additionally, the histopathological study demonstrated an improvement in the liver tissue of irradiated rats after treatment. Thus, ZnCoNPs and ZnCaNPs could be used as natural mitigating agents to reduce the hazards of ionizing radiation."

Some factors, such as industrialization and modernization, have allowed this to improve considerably. On the other hand, along with high global population growth, the factor which may jeopardize human health the most is environmental degradation, which can be tackled through the transition to renewable energy. The main purpose of our study is to investigate the relationship between renewable energy consumption, social factors, and health, using a Panel Vector Auto Regression (PVAR) technique. We explore the link between some proxy variables for renewable energy consumption, government policy, general public awareness, the market, lobbying activity, the energy dependence on third countries, and health, spanning the period from 1990 to 2015, for a cluster of 12 European countries characterized by common features. Specifically, our analysis shows the importance of having a stringent policy for the development of renewable energy consumption and its influence over other social factors, rather than the existence of causal relationships between health and renewable energy consumption for the analyzed countries. This kind of analysis has a great potential for policy-makers. Further, a deeper understanding of these relationships can create a more e ffective decision-making process."

This study considers the atlas development of wind characteristics analysis. Hourly mean wind data recorded during the years 2003 to 2008 by ONM ""Office National de la Meteorologie"" (the Algerian Meteorological Office), is used for the study. The mean wind speed, energy flux, the dominant wind direction, the frequency distribution, and the Weibull distribution scale and shape factors are determined and analyzed. Finally, RETScreen software is used to estimate the energy output and to conduct the economic feasibility of the wind farm in terms of Simple Payback Period (SPP), Internal Rate of Return, Annual Life Cycle Saving, Net Present Value, Year to Positive Cash Flow, Benefit-Cost ratio and cost of electricity production (COE). The economic analysis indicates that the project at Adrar region was economically viable with good energy production of 3146 MWh/yr and a Capacity Factor (CF) of 36%.The SPP was found to be around 3.9 years, and the COE of 3.25 US Cents/kWh was found lower than the wholesale price of electricity during the feed-in tariff period."

Multi-omics data of SAT from 37 females were obtained from Gene Expression Omnibus database, and 1860 genes, 56 miRNAs, and 332 methylated genes were identified as being differentially expressed during aging among non-obese females. Using Weighted Correlation Network Analysis (WGCNA), 1754 DEGs were defined as aging-associated genes for non-obese females, distributed among ten co-expression modules. Through Gene Ontology enrichment analysis and Gene Set enrichment analysis on those aging-associated DEGs, SAT aging was observed to be characterized by variations in immune and inflammatory states, mitochondria, lipid and carbohydrate metabolism, and regulation of vascular development. SUPV3L1, OGT, and ARPC1B were identified as conserved and core SAT-aging-related genes, as verified by RT-qPCR among 18 samples in different age groups. Multi-omics regulatory networks of core aging-associated biological processes of SAT were also constructed. Based on WGCNA, we performed differential co-expression analysis to unveil the differences in aging-related co-expression patterns between obese and non-obese females and determined that obesity could be an important accelerating factor in aging processes. Our work provides a landscape of SAT aging, which could be helpful for further research in fields such as repair and reconstruction as well as aging."
46,Peer-to-peer energy trading potential: An assessment for the residential sector under different technology and tariff availabilities,"Neves, Diana; Scott, Ian; Silva, Carlos A.","The increasing number of distributed renewable energy systems and smart-grid technologies, are transforming electricity grids and markets, allowing the growth of peer-to-peer (P2P) energy markets, where consumers and prosumers trade directly with each other. Policymakers are then faced with the task of assessing alternative ways to manage and organize the electricity grid and market. This work explores the potential of P2P energy trading under different available technologies and market paradigms, by analysing the economic benefits for residential consumers and prosumers, given different solar generation contexts and load flexibility levels. The model is applied to the Portuguese residential sector. Results show that with best techno-economic sizing solution for solar photovoltaic (PV), the greater economic gains come from flexibility, reaching a maximum of 28% for consumers and 55% for prosumers, in a P2P trading scenario. However, if we consider flexibility and a high-solar fraction PV sizing, the savings would reach 29% for consumers and 113% for prosumers. P2P economic benefits are found to depend on the type of participating agents involved, demand profile, PV surplus and monetization schemes, level of flexible equipment, which will greatly influence which trading strategies work best, meaning that each case study needs a tailored P2P trading scheme.

Combined morphological characters allowed us to describe our isolates as two new genera and species in Microthyriaceae, named as: Keqinzhangia aquatica and Pseudocoronospora hainanense. The full descriptions, illustrations, and a phylogenetic tree showing the position of the two new genera were provided in this paper."
48,Day -ahead energy management and feeder reconfiguration for microgrids with CCHP and energy storage systems,"Fazlhashemi, Seyed Saeed; Sedighizadeh, Mostafa; Khodayar, Mohammad E.","Energy management featuring distribution feeder reconfiguration (DFR) and reactive power control, improves the technical and economic efficiency of microgrids. The present work proposes a framework that leverages scenarios to jointly manage the real and reactive power dispatches of the controllable generation resources as well as the topology of the distribution feeder. Multiple operation measures are optimized including the operation cost, real power loss, the voltage stability index (VSI), and the greenhouse gas emissions of the microgrid. Hybrid Big Bang- Big Crunch (HBB-BC) algorithm is used to solve the formulated optimization problem. Nondispatchable and dispatchable distributed generation units (DGs), as well as the battery and thermal energy storage systems (BESS and TESS), are considered as a hybrid energy system. Combined cooling, heating, and power (CCHP) units are considered as dispatchable DGs and wind and solar photovoltaic generations are considered as non-dispatchable DGs. The efficiency of the proposed model and solution algorithm is investigated using a 33-bus microgrid, and the simulation outcomes are discussed."

50,Renewable Energy in Final Energy Consumption and Income in the EU-28 Countries,"Simionescu, Mihaela; Strielkowski, Wadim; Tvaronavciene, Manuela","The deployment of renewable energy sources (RES) is considered to be an important objective for the energy sector in the European Union (EU). The EU Directive adapted in 2009 fixed mandatory national targets for the use of renewable energy in transport as well as for the share of RES in the gross final energy consumption. Contrary to previous studies, this paper does not examine the link between the RES and economic growth but rather focuses on real gross domestic product (GDP) and the implementation of national renewable energy targets. We employ panel data models for the case of the EU-28 countries covering the period between 2007 and 2017 that yield a low and positive relationship between the impact of GDP per capita and the share of RES in the final consumption. Our results show that there is a significant causality only from real GDP per capita to the share of renewable energy in final consumption, marking the potential of developed countries to consume more RES. We list some groups of countries according to these variables using a cluster analysis approach. Starting from the proposed panel data models, we constructed the scenarios for the 2020 for various shares of RES and different EU Member States. Overall, it appears that more attention should be attributed to policy proposals in which funding opportunities would be dependent on the achievements of national targets and economic benefits should be given to countries with very good performance in achieving high shares of renewable energy in their final energy consumption."
51,Energy consumption and financial development indicators nexuses in Asian economies: a dynamic seemingly unrelated regression approach,"Yang, Li; Hui, Peng; Yasmeen, Rizwana; Ullah, Sana; Hafeez, Muhammad","In recent times, financial development and industrial progression accrue energy demand. Therefore, the present research is investigating the nexuses of energy consumption-financial development indicators for 32 Asian economies including the FDI, economic growth, and urban sprawl. The long-run marginal impacts and causal linkage are estimated through the dynamic seemingly unrelated regression and the heterogeneous causality respectively. The estimates infer that financial development indicators are deteriorating the energy consumption in the Asian region, while both FDI and urban sprawl accrue energy consumption. However, economy-wise estimates infer the heterogeneous impacts on energy consumption. Heterogenous causality infers a bidirectional causality among the financial development indicators and energy consumption. There is a need to devise the energy policies related to the financial sector for sustainable usage energy and a clean environment."
52,Analysis of asymmetries in the nexus among clean energy and environmental quality in Pakistan,"Usman, Ahmed; Ullah, Sana; Ozturk, Ilhan; Chishti, Muhammad Zubair; Zafar, Syeda Maria","This study examines the short-run and long-run asymmetric effects of clean energy consumption on carbon emission in Pakistan, over the annual time period 1975-2018, by using a non-linear ARDL approach. The findings of the study confirm the existence of asymmetries, in the nexus between the clean energy consumption and carbon emission in the short and long run. The findings of non-linear model confirm that carbon emission responded contrary to positive shocks of energy variables as compared with their negative shocks. Asymmetric findings recommend that positive and negative shocks of the alternative and nuclear energy and combustible and waste energy have affected differently. Although, short- and long-run results suggest an insignificant positive and negative relationship between electric power consumption and carbon emissions. Therefore, more taxation of non-renewable energy and clean energy supports are suggested for the Pakistan economy. We concluded that Pakistan has potential in clean energy which will improve environmental quality in the near future."

54,"The long-run and short-run influence of environmental pollution, energy consumption, and economic activities on health quality in emerging countries","Anser, Muhammad Khalid; Hanif, Imran; Xuan Vinh Vo; Alharthi, Majed","This study investigates the effect of energy utilization, greenhouses gasses emissions, and economic activities on health risks such as mortality rate and incidence of respiratory diseases in emerging Asian economies. The study analyzes a panel data from 1995 to 2018 to examine the long-run and short-run influence of environmental pollution on health issues. The empirical findings highlight that greenhouse gasses emissions, fossil fuel consumption, and natural resources depletion in the region are key factors to increasing health risks in the long-run period, while the use of clean energy and improvement in per capita economic growth is helping to improve the health status of the households. In a short period, greenhouse gasses emission is the only significant factor responsible for the high mortality rate and occurrence of respiratory diseases in the emerging economies of Asia. According to the results, there is a need for government intervention programs to rescue the region from the negative effects of environmental pollution and the utilization of nonrenewable energy. In emerging Asian countries, the combustion of fossil fuels, environmental pollution, and limited access to clean energy are such factors responsible for high mortality rate and stimulating incidence of respiratory diseases in the individuals. The study suggests that alternative green energy can prove helpful to control greenhouse gasses emissions and to control health issues by improving environmental quality. The study further suggests that the use of clean energy from water, wind, and sunlight may prove helpful to meet the energy requirement at the domestic level and improve the health status of the individuals by reducing the incidence of respiratory diseases in emerging countries of Asia."
55,Pulsed electric field promotes the growth metabolism of aerobic denitrifying bacteria Pseudomonas putida W207-14 by improving cell membrane permeability,"Fan Wang,Liang Li,Xuejie Li,Xiaomin Hu,Bo Zhang,Fan Wang,Liang Li,Xuejie Li,Xiaomin Hu,Bo Zhang","The purpose of this study was to explore the stimulation mechanism of low pulsed electric field (PEF) strength treatment to promote the growth metabolism of aerobic denitrifying bacteria Pseudomonas putida W207-14. The results indicated that compared with the control group, the strain W207-14 treated with PEF entered the logarithmic growth phase 5 h earlier, the growth time to reached the maximum cell optical density at 600 nm (OD600) of 1.935 ± 0.04 was only 24 h, which shortened by half. With the reduction of growth time, the metabolic rate of the strain increased significantly, in which the removal efficiency of COD, NO3--N and TN was 97.67 ± 1.12%, 90.34 ± 0.73% and 90.13 ± 0.10% in 24 h, respectively. The maximum nitrate removal rate increased from 3.49 mg/L/h to 7.53 mg/L/h. A large number of cells with simultaneous cell membrane damage and high physiological activity were observed by flow cytometry (FCM) in combination with fluorescence staining analysis, which confirmed the reversible electroporation on the cell membrane of strain W207-14 treated with PEF. Transcriptomic analysis indicated that PEF activated the highly significant differential expression of membrane porin (opdB, opdC, and oprB) and cytochrome oxidoreductase related genes (ccoP, ccoN, cioA and cioB) on the cell membrane, which promoted the transport of nutrients through the cell membrane and electron transfer during aerobic respiration and provided an explanation for the possible mechanism of PEF promoting the growth metabolism of strain W207-14 at the micro level. These results lay a foundation for the practical application of PEF enhanced aerobic denitrification technology."
56,"Innovation, foreign direct investment (FDI), and the energy-pollution-growth nexus in OECD region: a simultaneous equation modeling approach","Ahmad, Manzoor; Khattak, Shoukat Iqbal; Khan, Anwar; Rahman, Zia Ur","The paper proposes a new perspective in the environmental and resource economics literature by examining innovation (measured by R&D expenditures), FDI (measured by country-country technology transfer), and energy-environment-growth nexus. Using simultaneous equation modelling (SEMs), three econometric functions were formulated for production, energy consumption, and environmental pollution with GDP per capita, energy consumption, and CO2 emissions (CO(2)e) as dependent variables for twenty-four OECD economies for the period 1993 to 2014, respectively. The results failed to support the Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) hypothesis in the OECD economies. At the same time, a two-way causality was observed between GDP per capita and energy consumption per capita, indicating that the pollution has not yet reached the maximum threshold. Moreover, the results unveiled that fossil-fuel consumption, innovation, and FDI were the primary sources of CO(2)e. The paper offers important implications for academics, policymakers, and identifies avenues for future research."

In this way, this work aims to review multiple criteria decision-making (MCDM) methods employed for measuring circular economy (CE) indicators and CE aspects at different levels (micro, meso, and macro). For this purpose, a systematic literature review (SLR) was conducted in ISI Web of Science and Scopus databases. Further, the results summarized 22 MCDM techniques, 27 CE aspects, and 36 CE indicators The SLR provides a concept map highlighting the relation of the level of circularity implementation (subdivided into micro-, meso-, and macro-levels) and MCDM techniques and demonstrates the interaction between CE aspects and indicators. The review provides an outline as to how MCDM techniques can solve problems related to CE aspects and marks the relevance in the use of CE indicators to support circularity aspects and to construct criteria in the methodologies applied."
58,"Are all real-world objects created equal? Estimating the ""set-size"" of the search target in visual working memory","Michael T Miuccio,Gregory J Zelinsky,Joseph Schmidt,Michael T Miuccio,Gregory J Zelinsky,Joseph Schmidt","Are all real-world objects created equal? Visual search difficulty increases with the number of targets and as target-related visual working memory (VWM) load increases. Our goal was to investigate the load imposed by individual real-world objects held in VWM in the context of search. Measures of visual clutter attempt to quantify real-world set-size in the context of scenes. We applied one of these measures, the number of proto-objects, to individual real-world objects and used contralateral delay activity (CDA) to measure the resulting VWM load. The current study presented a real-world object as a target cue, followed by a delay where CDA was measured. This was followed by a four-object search array. We compared CDA and later search performance from target cues containing a high or low number of proto-objects. High proto-object target cues resulted in greater CDA, longer search RTs, target dwell times, and reduced search guidance, relative to low proto-object targets. These findings demonstrate that targets with more proto-objects result in a higher VWM load and reduced search performance. This shows that the number of proto-objects contained within individual objects produce set-size like effects in VWM and suggests proto-objects may be a viable unit of measure of real-world VWM load. Importantly, this demonstrates that not all real-world objects are created equal."

61,Influence of circumferential annular grooving design of impeller on suspended fluid force of axial flow blood pump,"Liang Wang,Zhong Yun,Xiaoyan Tang,Chuang Xiang,Liang Wang,Zhong Yun,Xiaoyan Tang,Chuang Xiang","Aiming at insufficient suspension force on the impeller when the hydraulic suspension axial flow blood pump is start at low speed, the impeller suspension stability is poor, and can't quickly enter the suspended working state. By establishing the mathematical model of the suspension force on the impeller, then the influence of the circumferential groove depth of the impeller on the suspension force is analyzed, and the annular groove depth on the impeller blade in the direction of fluid inlet and outlet was determined as (0.26, 0.02 mm). When the blood pump starts, there is an eccentricity between the impeller and the pump tube, the relationship between the suspension force and the speed of the impeller under different eccentricities is analyzed. Combined with the prototype experiment, the circumferential annular grooving design of the impeller can make the blood pump rotate at about 3500 rpm into the suspension state, when the impeller is at 8000 rpm, the impeller can basically achieve stable suspension at the eccentricity of 0.1 mm in the gravity direction, indicating that the reasonable circumferential annular grooving design of the impeller can effectively improve the suspension hydraulic force of the impeller and improve the stability of the hydraulic suspension axial flow blood pump."
62,Application of filter media surface hydrophobic modification to reduce bioclogging in the infiltration system,"Ping Tang,Penghui Ma,Shichao Weng,Yongchao Zhou,Ping Tang,Penghui Ma,Shichao Weng,Yongchao Zhou","Bioclogging is a commonly encountered operational issue that lowers hydraulic conductivity and the overall performance of the infiltration systems. In this paper, a novel processing for alleviating bioclogging by filter media surface hydrophobic modification was presented. Two-dimensional porous media cells were used to observe the influence of hydrophobic modification on biofilm growth in the pore structure. Moreover, two continuous-flow columns packed with gravel, one of which half gravel was hydrophobically modified, were operated with artificial wastewater to verify the effect of hydrophobic modification on bioclogging alleviation. The results showed that the biofilm growth in the cell with hydrophobic modification was slow, and the biomass was less and liable to wipe off after hydrophobic treatment. Meanwhile, the hydraulic efficiency of the flow seepage field was also improved after hydrophobic treatment. The column tests results showed that the hydraulic conductivity of the filter bed with hydrophobic modification (Column B) decreased more slowly than that of another without hydrophobic modification (Column A). Column B had the hydraulic conductivity (k) of 0.66 cm/s in the final stage of the experiment, while the k of Column A was 0.14 cm/s. It verified that hydrophobic modification of partial filter media can alleviate the bioclogging problem of the infiltration systems to some extent. The results provide a new idea and potential technical support for solving bioclogging problem."
63,Application based multi-objective performance optimization of a proton exchange membrane fuel cell,"Sohani, Ali; Naderi, Shayan; Torabi, Farschad; Sayyaadi, Hoseyn; Akhlaghi, Yousef Golizadeh; Zhao, Xudong; Talukdar, Krishan; Said, Zafar","An application-based multi-objective optimization approach is presented to acquire the best operation condition for a proton-exchange membrane fuel cell. The optimization is done for propulsion, power station, and portable applications, in which the recommended range for decision variables and importance level of the objective functions are taken into consideration for optimization to obtain more accurate and practical results. In the multi-objective optimization, from each important aspect of the performance, i.e., technical, economic, dimensional, and environmental aspects, one objective is selected. The effect of the maximum allowable (threshold) current density on both optimum decision variables and objective functions are also investigated to find the best value for that. The results reveal that increasing the maximum allowable current density leads to improvements in optimized values of all the objective functions. Moreover, the conducted sensitivity analyses determine that the best value for threshold current density for the propulsion and power station applications is 1.3 A cm (-2) and for the portable application is 1.5 A cm(-2). Furthermore, comparison of the results to the base case condition shows that values of the temperature, pressure, and voltage in power station are not affected by optimization, whereas substantial decrease in both propulsion and portable applications brings more level of safety. Similarly, objective functions, i.e., efficiency, levelized cost, size, and greenhouse emission are averagely improved by 9.93, 16.95, 37.13, and 7.77%, respectively. The proposed procedure helps to design and manufacture the high-performance proton-exchange membrane fuel cells based on the employed application and users' preference. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

65,Blockchain Based Sustainable Local Energy Trading Considering Home Energy Management and Demurrage Mechanism,"Yahaya, Adamu Sani; Javaid, Nadeem; Alzahrani, Fahad A.; Rehman, Amjad; Ullah, Ibrar; Shahid, Affaf; Shafiq, Muhammad","With the increase in local energy generation from Renewable Energy Sources (RESs), the concept of decentralized peer-to-peer Local Energy Market (LEM) is becoming popular. In this paper, a blockchain-based LEM is investigated, where consumers and prosumers in a small community trade energy without the need for a third party. In the proposed model, a Home Energy Management (HEM) system and demurrage mechanism are introduced, which allow both the prosumers and consumers to optimize their energy consumption and to minimize electricity costs. This method also allows end-users to shift their load to off-peak hours and to use cheap energy from the LEM. The proposed solution shows how energy consumption and electricity cost are optimized using HEM and demurrage mechanism. It also provides economic benefits at both the community and end-user levels and provides sufficient energy to the LEM. The simulation results show that electricity cost is reduced up to 44.73% and 28.55% when the scheduling algorithm is applied using the Critical Peak Price (CPP) and Real-Time Price (RTP) schemes, respectively. Similarly, 65.15% and 35.09% of costs are reduced when CPP and RTP are applied with demurrage mechanism. Moreover, 51.80% and 44.37% electricity costs reduction is observed when CPP and RTP are used with both demurrage and scheduling algorithm. We also carried out security vulnerability analysis to ensure that our energy trading smart contract is secure and bug-free against the common vulnerabilities and attacks."
66,Does the modifying role of institutional quality remains homogeneous in GDP-CO2 emission nexus? New evidence from ARDL approach,"Mehmood, Usman; Tariq, Salman; Ul-Haq, Zia; Meo, Muhammad Saeed","This study presents a country-specific analysis for three developing countries (Pakistan, India, and Bangladesh) to determine the interaction effect of institutional quality and economic growth along with other control variables (foreign direct investment and renewable energy) on CO2 emissions. This research uses an auto regressive distributed lag (ARDL) model for quarterly data ranging from 1996Q1 to 2016Q4. The findings show that the interaction cause of economic growth and institutional quality on CO2 emissions is not homogeneous in developing countries. In India and Bangladesh, the modifying role of institutional quality is evident to reducing CO2 emissions but in Pakistan, this interacting effect increases CO2 emissions. The findings confirm an inverted U-shaped EKC in Pakistan and Bangladesh but not significant in India. The independent role of GDP and institutional quality significantly reduces CO2 emissions in Pakistan and Bangladesh."
67,Stem Cell Mimicking Nanoencapsulation for Targeting Arthritis,"Min Jun Shin,Jun Young Park,Dae Ho Lee,Dongwoo Khang,Min Jun Shin,Jun Young Park,Dae Ho Lee,Dongwoo Khang","Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are considered a promising regenerative therapy due to their ability to migrate toward damaged tissues. The homing ability of MSCs is unique compared with that of non-migrating cells and MSCs are considered promising therapeutic vectors for targeting major cells in many pathophysiological sites. MSCs have many advantages in the treatment of malignant diseases, particularly rheumatoid arthritis (RA). RA is a representative autoimmune disease that primarily affects joints, and secreted chemokines in the joints are well recognized by MSCs following their migration to the joints. Furthermore, MSCs can regulate the inflammatory process and repair damaged cells in the joints. However, the functionality and migration ability of MSCs injected in vivo still show insufficient. The targeting ability and migration efficiency of MSCs can be enhanced by genetic engineering or modification, eg, overexpressing chemokine receptors or migration-related genes, thus maximizing their therapeutic effect. However, there are concerns about genetic changes due to the increased probability of oncogenesis resulting from genome integration of the viral vector, and thus, clinical application is limited. Furthermore, it is suspected that administering MSCs can promote tumor growth and metastasis in xenograft and orthotopic models. For this reason, MSC mimicking nanoencapsulations are an alternative strategy that does not involve using MSCs or bioengineered MSCs. MSC mimicking nanoencapsulations consist of MSC membrane-coated nanoparticles, MSC-derived exosomes and artificial ectosomes, and MSC membrane-fused liposomes with natural or genetically engineered MSC membranes. MSC mimicking nanoencapsulations not only retain the targeting ability of MSCs but also have many advantages in terms of targeted drug delivery. Specifically, MSC mimicking nanoencapsulations are capable of encapsulating drugs with various components, including chemotherapeutic agents, nucleic acids, and proteins. Furthermore, there are fewer concerns over safety issues on MSC mimicking nanoencapsulations associated with mutagenesis even when using genetically engineered MSCs, because MSC mimicking nanoencapsulations use only the membrane fraction of MSCs. Genetic engineering is a promising route in clinical settings, where nano-encapsulated technology strategies are combined. In this review, the mechanism underlying MSC homing and the advantages of MSC mimicking nanoencapsulations are discussed. In addition, genetic engineering of MSCs and MSC mimicking nanoencapsulation is described as a promising strategy for the treatment of immune-related diseases."
68,Inside-out sustainability: The neglect of inner worlds,"Ives, Christopher D.; Freeth, Rebecca; Fischer, Joern","In the context of continuing ecosystem degradation and deepening socio-economic inequality, sustainability scientists must question the adequacy of current scholarship and practice. We argue that pre-occupation with external phenomena and collective social structures has led to the neglect of people's 'inner worlds'-their emotions, thoughts, identities and beliefs. These lie at the heart of actions for sustainability, and have powerful transformative capacity for system change. The condition of people's inner worlds ought to also be considered a dimension of sustainability itself. Compassion, empathy and generosity, for example, are personal characteristics that mark individual expressions of sustainability. Sustainability science must take inner life more seriously by considering how language shapes and is shaped by paradigms about the world, prioritising enquiry into how spirituality, contemplation and sustainability transformation relate, and encouraging scholars and practitioners to intentionally cultivate their inner worlds to strengthen inner resources necessary for addressing sustainability challenges."
69,Pragmatic sedation strategies to prevent secondary brain injury in low-resource settings,"R K Kayambankadzanja,R Samwel,T Baker,R K Kayambankadzanja,R Samwel,T Baker","Traumatic brain injury is the alteration in brain function due to an external force. It is common and affects millions of people worldwide annually. The World Health Organization estimates that 90% of global deaths caused by injuries occur in low- and middle-income countries, with traumatic brain injury contributing up to half of these trauma-related deaths. Patients with traumatic brain injury in low- and middle-income countries have twice the odds of dying compared with their counterparts in high-income countries. Sedation is a key element of care in the management of traumatic brain injury, used for its neuroprotective effects and to prevent secondary brain injury. While sedatives have the potential to improve outcomes, they can be challenging to administer and have potentially dangerous complications. Sedation in low-resource settings should aim to be effective, safe, affordable and feasible. In this paper, we summarise the indications for sedation in traumatic brain injury, the choice of sedative drugs and the pragmatic management and monitoring of sedated traumatic brain injury patients in low-resource settings."
70,Imbalance of carbon embodied in South-South trade: Evidence from China-India trade,"Wang, Qiang; Yang, Xue","China and India are the countries with the largest increase in carbon emissions and one of the fastest growing economies in the world. A better understanding of the carbon emissions embodied in China-India trade can service to curb carbon emission in both countries. In this work, we investigated temporal change and driving forces of the carbon emissions embodied in China-India trade from 2000 to 2015 using the Multi-Regional Input-Output model and Structural Decomposition Analysis. The results showed China was a net exporter of embodied carbon and a net exporter of trade in China-India trade, which indicated that China increased its environmental costs while gaining economic benefits. And the imbalance in China's embodied carbon trade was far greater than the trade imbalance. The industrial structure of China's export of embodied carbon and India's export of embodied carbon were difference, although electricity and heavy manufacturing industries dominated the embodied carbon exports of China and India. The decomposition results showed the leading contributor to increase in the embodied carbon emissions of China and India was the increase in final demand, in which the effect of per capita demand was the main driving factor affecting the change of embodied carbon emissions. The carbon intensity coefficient effect was the driving factor in suppressing the increase in embodied carbon emissions in China and India. This research could enrich the study of carbon emission embodied in South-South trade. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."
71,Co-designing a curriculum model for career education: perspectives from regional communities in Australia,"Marian Mahat,Mollie Dollinger,Belinda D'Angelo,Ryan Naylor,Andrew Harvey,Marian Mahat,Mollie Dollinger,Belinda D'Angelo,Ryan Naylor,Andrew Harvey","The vocational experiences and skills of young adolescents could be infused into formal education by identifying career competencies to be taught within the academic curriculum. Such curriculum practices that embed educational and career pathways must also include the perspectives of students and the community, particularly those from marginalised groups. Drawing on data from 111 teachers, principals, carers and students, this paper presents research undertaken to co-design career education lesson plans within an infused model of the curriculum for early Middle Year students from regional, rural, and remote Australia. The lesson plans and activities were designed to allow for meaningful self-reflection and goal-setting that could be seamlessly infused into the formal curriculum and help embed early-stage career education. The paper concludes by projecting opportunities and challenges for seamless curriculum integration, while pertinent to the Australian context, can also be read with broader relevance to other educational systems and schools."
72,Atypical presentation of fistula dysfunction due to brachial arterial embolization mimicking stroke,"Rita Vicente,Laura Rodriguez,Joaquim Vallespín,Carolina Rubiella,Jose Ibeas,Rita Vicente,Laura Rodriguez,Joaquim Vallespín,Carolina Rubiella,Jose Ibeas","Vascular access thrombosis is an important complication with great impact on access patency and, consequently, on a patient's quality of life and survival. We report the case of a 73-year-old woman with chronic kidney disease on hemodialysis with a radiocephalic arteriovenous fistula on the right arm that was brought to the emergency department with decreased strength in her right arm, ipsilateral hypoesthesia and facial hemi-hypoesthesia. The patient was given a brain computed tomographic scan that did not confirm suspicion of stroke. On re-examination, the patient had new-onset pain at arteriovenous fistula level, and her right arm was cold and pale. The nephrology department was called for arteriovenous fistula evaluation. On physical examination, her forearm fistula had a decreased thrill and arm elevation exacerbated its paleness. A bedside ultrasound was performed for arteriovenous fistula assessment. Doppler ultrasound revealed: partial thrombosis at brachial bifurcation, a flow of 80-105 mL/min at brachial artery level and a radial artery with a damped waveform. Anastomosis and draining vein were permeable. In this case, the diagnosis of acute embolic brachial artery occlusion was made by a fast bedside ultrasound evaluation. The patient underwent thromboembolectomy with Fogarty technique, recovering fistula thrill, radial and cubital pulses. Thromboembolism of the fistula feeding artery is a rare cause of vascular access thrombosis and it is rarely mentioned in the literature. In this report, failure to recognize the upper limb ischemia would have led to delayed treatment, potentially resulting in the fistula's complete thrombosis and further limb ischemia. We highlight the importance of a diagnosis method like Doppler ultrasound, which allows for rapid evaluation at the patient's bedside."
73,Evaluating the effects of different processing methods on the nutritional composition of shrimp and the antioxidant activity of shrimp powder,"Nora A AlFaris,Ghedeir M Alshammari,Jozaa Z AlTamimi,Lujain A AlMousa,Reham I Alagal,Nora M AlKehayez,Dalal H Aljabryn,Muneer M Alsayadi,Mohammed Abdo Yahya,Nora A AlFaris,Ghedeir M Alshammari,Jozaa Z AlTamimi,Lujain A AlMousa,Reham I Alagal,Nora M AlKehayez,Dalal H Aljabryn,Muneer M Alsayadi,Mohammed Abdo Yahya","Shrimp is a prevalent food in the Arabian Gulf that is known for its good sensory properties and high nutritional value. The aim of the present work was to assess the effects of diverse processing methods on the nutritional composition of shrimp and the antioxidant activity of shrimp powder. Shrimp (Penaeus semisulcatus) flesh was treated using four processes (salting, frying, grilling, and boiling), following which its macronutrient content, fatty acid profile, vitamins and mineral contents were measured. Also, the antioxidant activity of all shrimp powder extracts was assessed using the 2, 2 diphenyl 1 picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), linoleic acid oxidation inhibition, and reducing power methods. The results revealed that the fresh and processed shrimp flesh had significant nutritional value and the fresh and treated shrimp powders have high antioxidant activity, but the cooking processes have significant effects on the nutritional value and antioxidant activity of shrimp flesh. These effects were greater significantly in grilled shrimp followed by boiled shrimp and then fried shrimp. It is concluded that the high nutritional value and antioxidant activity of shrimp flesh make it an important food for nutritional health promotion for the community."

People living with HIV are more susceptible to HPV. Campos dos Goytacazes implemented the quadrivalent HPV vaccine (4vHPV) for women living with HIV (WLWH) in 2011, 4 years before the Brazilian public vaccination program. We aimed to characterize the genomic diversity and predictors of HPV infection in WLWH through a prospective cohort study. After the consent form was received, a questionnaire was applied and an endocervical sample was collected. For genotyping, a microarray HPV technique was performed. Two intervention moments were performed: T1, the initial moment, with collection and vaccination; T2 moment, 2 years after T1. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed. The T1 moment cohort was formed by 146 women,107 belonging to Group 1(HPV-negative) and 39 to Group 2 (HPV-positive). The variables age, marital status, number of children, number of sexual partners, and CD4 count were protective against HPV. The variables number of sexual partners, marital status, and the number of children lost significance in multivariate analysis. Concerning T2 moment, 42 patients were followed with three positive cases. The use of 4vHPV is beneficial for this population and should also be recommended at an age from 26 to 45 years inside the public vaccination program."
75,Virtual Bronchoscopy-Guided Transbronchial Biopsy Simulation Using a Head-Mounted Display: A New Style of Flexible Bronchoscopy,"Shotaro Okachi,Takayasu Ito,Kazuhide Sato,Shingo Iwano,Yuka Shinohara,Hideyuki Itoigawa,Naozumi Hashimoto,Shotaro Okachi,Takayasu Ito,Kazuhide Sato,Shingo Iwano,Yuka Shinohara,Hideyuki Itoigawa,Naozumi Hashimoto","Background/need. The increases in reference images and information during bronchoscopy using virtual bronchoscopic navigation (VBN) and fluoroscopy has potentially created the need for support using a head-mounted display (HMD) because bronchoscopists feel difficulty to see displays that are at a distance from them and turn their head and body in various directions. Methodology and device description. The binocular see-through Moverio BT-35E Smart Glasses can be connected via a high-definition multimedia interface and have a 720p high-definition display. We developed a system that converts fluoroscopic (live and reference), VBN, and bronchoscopic image signals through a converter and references them using the Moverio BT-35E. Preliminary results. We performed a virtual bronchoscopy-guided transbronchial biopsy simulation using the system. Four experienced pulmonologists performed a simulated bronchoscopy of 5 cases each with the Moverio BT-35E glasses, using bronchoscopy training model. For all procedures, the bronchoscope was advanced successfully into the target bronchus according to the VBN image. None of the operators reported eye or body fatigue during or after the procedure. Current status. This small-scale simulation study suggests the feasibility of using a HMD during bronchoscopy. For clinical use, it is necessary to evaluate the safety and usefulness of the system in larger clinical trials in the future."
76,Antiviral Properties of Streptomyces tuirus DBZ39 Mediated Gold Nanoparticles Against Bluetongue virus,"Bi Bi Zainab Mazhari,Bi Bi Zainab Mazhari","&lt;b&gt;Background and Objective:&lt;/b&gt; The proposed study involves the approach from the point of anti-viral activity of gold nanoparticles against the &lt;i&gt;Bluetongue virus&lt;/i&gt;. Among viral diseases, Bluetongue is regarded as an economically scouring disease. Neither a vaccine nor an antiviral drug is available for the prevention or treatment of this disease. The antiviral activity of gold nanoparticles synthesized by a novel isolate of &lt;i&gt;Streptomyces tuirus&lt;/i&gt; DBZ39 is the breakthrough of the study. &lt;i&gt;Streptomyces tuirus &lt;/i&gt;DBZ39, a novel isolate obtained from alkaline soil was proved to be efficient actinomycetes, for the extracellular synthesis of gold nanoparticles. &lt;b&gt;Materials and Methods:&lt;/b&gt; An upstream bioprocess was optimized and developed for the synthesis of controlled size gold nanoparticles with solitary mono dispersal pattern in aurum chloride solution. The characterization and confirmation of gold nanoparticles were illustrated by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM), Energy Dispersive X-ray Analysis (EDAX) and Fourier Transmission Infrared Radiation Analysis (FTIR). &lt;b&gt;Results:&lt;/b&gt; Biomass size of 3 g, substrate concentration of 1 mM, pH of 8.5 and temperature of 45°C were observed as optimum conditions for the synthesis of 15-24 nm size gold nanoparticles. The &lt;i&gt;Bluetongue virus&lt;/i&gt; (BTV) which belongs to the genus Orbivirus in the family Reoviridae with 26 serotypes is an etiological agent of infectious and non-contagious Bluetongue disease of main sheep and several other domestic animals. &lt;b&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/b&gt; Gold nanoparticles for the 1st time, at a higher concentration of 1:64 dilutions revealed a very promising and novel antiviral property against the &lt;i&gt;Bluetongue virus&lt;/i&gt;."
77,Prevalence and Interpersonal Correlates of Internet Gaming Disorders among Chinese Adolescents,"Yang, Xue; Jiang, Xuewen; Mo, Phoenix Kit-han; Cai, Yong; Ma, Le; Lau, Joseph Tak-fai","This study investigated the prevalence and interpersonal correlates of Internet gaming disorders (IGD) among Chinese adolescents. A cross-sectional survey was conducted in two cities (Shanghai and Xi'an) in China. A total of 2666 (Mean(age) = 12.77 +/- 0.75) year-one students from eight middle schools completed a self-reported questionnaire. It tested their levels of IGD, parental psychological control, negative interpersonal events (physical/verbal abuse by parents, verbal abuse by teachers, peer/online bullying), social support from parents/peers, and positive relationships with parents/peers. Results showed that 346 participants (13.0%) were classified as having IGD. Gender, city, single-parent family, family socio-economic status, and mother's education level were significantly associated with the risk of IGD. Logistic regression analyses with and without controlling for the significant background variables showed that the studied interpersonal variables were significantly associated with IGD, respectively. Forward stepwise logistic regression showed that the significant correlates of IGD included parental psychological control, physical/verbal abuse by parents, verbal abuse by teachers, and peer/online bullying. Results highlight the importance of addressing interpersonal risk factors to reduce adolescent IGD. Limitations and implications of this study are discussed."
78,Social hierarchies and social networks in humans,"Daniel Redhead,Eleanor A Power,Daniel Redhead,Eleanor A Power","Across species, social hierarchies are often governed by dominance relations. In humans, where there are multiple culturally valued axes of distinction, social hierarchies can take a variety of forms and need not rest on dominance relations. Consequently, humans navigate multiple domains of status, i.e. relative standing. Importantly, while these hierarchies may be constructed from dyadic interactions, they are often more fundamentally guided by subjective peer evaluations and group perceptions. Researchers have typically focused on the distinct elements that shape individuals' relative standing, with some emphasizing individual-level attributes and others outlining emergent macro-level structural outcomes. Here, we synthesize work across the social sciences to suggest that the dynamic interplay between individual-level and meso-level properties of the social networks in which individuals are embedded are crucial for understanding the diverse processes of status differentiation across groups. More specifically, we observe that humans not only navigate multiple social hierarchies at any given time but also simultaneously operate within multiple, overlapping social networks. There are important dynamic feedbacks between social hierarchies and the characteristics of social networks, as the types of social relationships, their structural properties, and the relative position of individuals within them both influence and are influenced by status differentiation. This article is part of the theme issue 'The centennial of the pecking order: current state and future prospects for the study of dominance hierarchies'."
79,Enhancing purchase intention in circular economy: An empirical evidence of remanufactured automotive product in Thailand,"Pisitsankkhakarn, Rachada; Vassanadumrongdee, Sujitra","Within spectrum of circular economy concept, remanufacturing is known as the key closed-loop supply chain strategy. Although academic research on remanufacturing has been increasingly conducted, the majority of prior research were conducted in the theme of best practices. A small number of studies started to address the demand for circular economy products as a challenge to the continuity of circular economy practices. Thus, this study focuses on the demand aspect of remanufacturing, especially in emerging economies where literature in this area of study is limited. This research was conducted with the objective to explore the key drivers to enhance consumer demand for remanufactured products, especially in emerging economy like Thailand, where socio-economic conditions are different from those in developed countries. Quantitative data collection method was employed with a survey of 200 vehicle owners in Bangkok. The extended theory of planned behavior was used as theoretical framework with the inclusion of marketing stimuli to analyze consumer behavior in purchasing remanufactured products. In addition, partial least square-structural equation modeling with the importance-performance map analysis was employed as the key statistical analysis technique. The findings indicate that attitude and subjective norm are positively correlated with consumers' purchase intention toward remanufactured products. Product and price stimulating factors are also determined to significantly enhance consumers' purchase intention with significant effect size via attitude. Results lead to practical implication that joint coordination between government agencies and industrial players is required for product and price improvement to enhance consumers' purchase intention for remanufactured products in emerging economy."
80,"Renewable energy, urbanization, and ecological footprint in the Middle East and North Africa region","Nathaniel, Solomon; Anyanwu, Ogochukwu; Shah, Muhammad","The countries in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region have the greatest potential for renewable energy consumption in the world and is likely to be the most vulnerable to the horrendous effects of climate change. Unfortunately, only a few of the countries have tapped into this potential, as non-renewable energy still dominates the total energy mix of these countries. This study explores the effect of renewable and non-renewable energy consumption on the environment in MENA countries from 1990 to 2016 by applying the Augmented Mean Group algorithm while accounting for urbanization, financial development, and economic growth. The panel result suggests that financial development, economic growth, and urbanization add to environmental degradation. Also, findings reveal that renewable energy does not contribute meaningfully to environmental quality, while non-renewable energy consumption significantly adds to environmental degradation. A uni-directional causality flows from urbanization, economic growth, and energy use to environmental degradation. One way to abate this damage is for countries in this region to embrace and promote the consumption of clean energy sources."
81,Modelling reverse supply chain through system dynamics for realizing the transition towards the circular economy: A case study on electric vehicle batteries,"Alamerew, Yohannes A.; Brissaud, Daniel","Circular economy (CE) is increasingly recognized as an issue of critical importance for companies, academics, practitioners, policymakers, and society as a whole. A successful transition from the current, linear economic model towards a resource-efficient circular economy model requires a shared understanding of the interplay among the building blocks of circular economy and the interaction among various decision factors. This research aims to explore these dynamics using environmental, societal, and economic aspects from a reverse supply chain perspective. This paper presents a model to represent the complex system of reverse logistics to recover post-used products at their end-of-life (EoL) stage. A system dynamics (SD) approach is used to model the dynamics of cost, revenue, and strategic and regulatory decisions. In addition, the interplay among the main pillars of circular economy research is explored through a case study of electric vehicle batteries (EVBs). Moreover, the main enablers and challenges for recovery of end-of-life batteries are presented. The findings show the importance of a shared understanding to achieve a successful transition towards a resource-efficient and circular economy model. Furthermore, reuse strategies such as remanufacturing and repurposing present a huge market potential for the recovery of electric vehicle batteries in the near future. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

82,Design of fractional order PID controller for load frequency control system with communication delay,"Anand Kumar,Somnath Pan,Anand Kumar,Somnath Pan","This work explores a frequency-domain approach to design a fractional order proportional-integral-derivative (FO-PID) controller cascaded with a first-order filter for the load frequency control (LFC) system with communication delay. The proposed method is based on suitable reference model development in the direct synthesis (DS) approach, followed by frequency response matching technique. The reference model is developed for robust control-loop performance using the stability-margin and time-domain specifications. The values of the fractional orders of the integral and derivative terms are obtained according to the dynamics of the nominal system. The proposed controllers have been designed for some LFC systems taken from the literature that have different dynamics with reheat, non-reheat and hydraulic turbines and performances with non-linearity like generation rate constraint (GRC), generation dead band (GDB) along with noise have been compared favorably with that of some controllers prevalent in the literature. The proposed controllers have been shown to work efficaciously for the decentralized multi-area IEEE 39-bus New England test system along with variable communication delay. To show the efficacy of the proposed controllers the load-disturbance responses along with the frequency and time domain performance indices have been evaluated for comparison."
83,An optimised grey buffer operator for forecasting the production and sales of new energy vehicles in China,"He, Ling-Yang; Pei, Ling-Ling; Yang, Yu-He","In recent years, under a series of policy shocks, the production and sales of new energy vehicles in China show the characteristics of trend mutation and non-smoothness. In order to forecast the production and sales of new energy vehicles in China, an optimised grey buffer operator is proposed by introducing accumulation and translation transformations. Meanwhile, a genetic algorithm is employed to ascertain its optimum parameters. Forecasting results indicate that the optimised buffer operator can significantly improve the adaptability of the grey model to the production and sales data of new energy vehicles in China, and exhibits much higher prediction accuracy than those of the classical buffer operator and grey model. Besides, the prediction results show that the production and sales of China's new energy vehicles will continue to grow from 2018 to 2020, with an average annual growth rate of 27.53% and 30.49%, respectively.

84,Partial replacement of copper slag with treated crumb rubber aggregates in alkali-activated slag mortar,"Ameri, Farshad; Shoaei, Parham; Musaeei, Hamid Reza; Zareei, Seyed Alireza; Cheah, Chee Ban","Copper slag (CS) is an industrial waste, which is generally disposed of in landfills, posing threats to the environment. Alternatively, it can be used as natural aggregate replacement in concrete/m ortar, however, it results in a significant increase in material density, production and handling cost. The use of crumb rubber in combination with CS can overcome these problems, but there was no prior study on effect of such combination on the properties of alkali activated mortars (AAMs). The primary aim of this study is to address the problem stated above by replacing CS with 5, 10, 15% (by volume) crumb rubber in alkaliactivated slag mortars. Furthermore, the effect of pre-treatm ent of crumb rubber aggregates with sodium hydroxide (NaOH) solution for 1 h and 2 4 h on workability, compressive strength, flexural strength, w ater absorption, thermal conductivity, and microstructural properties of mortar mixes was investigated. Based on the test results, the use of crumb rubber resulted in inferior workability and mechanical strength, but better thermal insulating capability as compared to the control mix. Alkali treatm ent promoted the rubber-binder bond and effectively enhanced the strength of mixes, especially at an early-age (up to 59%), however, alkali treatm ent for 2 4 h drastically reduced the workability of fresh mix. Thus, it is recommended to use 10% crumb rubber pre-soaked in NaOH solution for 1 h to achieve acceptable performance. Finally, the economic and ecological analysis results revealed that the produced m ortar is beneficial to the environment. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."

SGA devices are widely used by EMS clinicians as both rescue and primary airway management devices. While in common use for more than four decades, major developments in SGA education, science, and technology have influenced clinical strategies of SGA insertion and use in prehospital airway management for patients of all ages. NAEMSP recommends:SGAs have utility as a primary or secondary EMS airway intervention. EMS agencies should select SGA strategies that best suit available resources and local clinician skillset, as well as the nature of their clinical practice setting.EMS agencies that perform endotracheal intubation must also equip their clinicians with SGA devices and ensure adequate training and competence.In select situations, drug-assisted airway management may be used by properly credentialed EMS clinicians to facilitate SGA insertion.Confirmation of initial and continuous SGA placement using waveform capnography is strongly encouraged as a best practice.When it is functioning properly, EMS clinicians should refrain from converting an SGA to an endotracheal tube. The decision to convert an SGA to an endotracheal tube must consider the patient's condition, the effectiveness of SGA ventilations, and the clinical context and course of initial SGA insertionSGA training, competency, and clinical use must be continuously evaluated by EMS agencies using focused quality management programs."

R. crispus has been established by researchers to be effective agasint a few parasitic worms. In this study, we evaluated the potency of R. crispus extracts on the model organism, Caenorhabditis elegans and the bioactive compounds of the extracts were also identified. The solvent extracts of R. crispus were tested against C. elegans for up to 72 h. The effect of the extracts on C. elegans was examined using light microscopy (LM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). LM and SEM analysis showed damage on the body wall, reduced body and slight modifications of the nematode organs. The lethality test reveals a significant reduction in the viability of the nematode with the water extract of leaf (LF-WAE), among others, having the strongest potency against the nematode, with 83% lethality. Anlysis done with Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) spectra reveals various characteristic vibration bands and fingerprint bands at 3400-600 cm-1, identifying phenols, organic acids, aromatics, amines, among others in the plant. The compounds were identified with liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS), under the categories of flavonoids, steroidal alkaloids and proanthocyanidin. In conclusion, this study confirmed that R. crispus has anthelmintic potential, using standardised C. elegans models as a tool and suggests that there could be novel compounds yet to be explored in the studied plant that could be of great benefit to livestock and humans."
88,The spatial effect of tourism economic development on regional ecological efficiency,"Haibo, Chen; Ke, Dong; Fangfang, Wang; Ayamba, Emmanuel Caesar","The process of tourism economic development is accompanied by the consumption of energy and environment. It is of a big significance to measure the level of tourism economic development and regional eco-efficiency correctly to clarify the relationship between them, as it contributes to realizing the high-quality development of the tourism economy and the construction of ""beautiful China"". On the basis of the panel data of China's 30 provinces and cities from 2002 to 2016, the paper intends to evaluate the regional eco-efficiency and tourism economic development level by using the super-efficiency DEA model and the grey entropy weight method, and then construct spatial panel econometric model which is based on the previous data to deeply discuss the influence of tourism economy development on regional ecological efficiency and its spatial effect. The research shows that (1) regional ecological efficiency has significant spatial dependence and spatial aggregation characteristics. With the passing of time, this kind of positive spatial autocorrelation is gradually strengthened. (2) In the long-term development, tourism economic development and regional ecological efficiency show a more obvious ""Kuznets curve"" effect. (3) The ""U""-curve relationship between urbanization, environmental regulation, and regional eco-efficiency was confirmed. (4) In the process of tourism economic transformation and development, industrial pollution control, environmental regulation, technological level, urbanization, and investment openness are the main factors that affect the improvement of ecological efficiency in the local region. (5) Tourism economic development and urbanization levels have different spatial spillover effects in different periods, while investment openness has obvious positive spillover effects."
89,Impact of foreign trade on energy efficiency in China's textile industry,"Zhao, Hongli; Lin, Boqiang","Improving energy efficiency is important to ensure economic growth while conserving energy and reducing emissions. Based on the total factor energy efficiency of China's textile industry, this paper constructs a simultaneous equation model that includes the Tobit model, and empirically analyzes whether foreign trade affects energy efficiency in the textile industry as well as the mechanism of any such influence. The empirical results demonstrate positive feedback between foreign trade and energy efficiency in the textile industry, with imports impacting energy efficiency more than do exports. The foreign trade of textile industry is divided into import trade and export trade, which have different impacts on energy efficiency. Simultaneously, the results also confirm that R&D input, ownership structure and energy price significantly impact the energy efficiency of China's textile industry. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

90,Circular RNA Plasmacytoma Variant Translocation 1 (CircPVT1) knockdown ameliorates hypoxia-induced bladder fibrosis by regulating the miR-203/Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 3 (SOCS3) signaling axis,"Teng Li,Yi Xing,Guoxian Zhang,Yan Wang,Yinsheng Wei,Lingang Cui,Shaojin Zhang,Qingwei Wang,Teng Li,Yi Xing,Guoxian Zhang,Yan Wang,Yinsheng Wei,Lingang Cui,Shaojin Zhang,Qingwei Wang","The effects of circular RNAs (circRNAs) on bladder outlet obstruction (BOO)-induced hypertrophy and fibrogenesis in rats and hypoxia-induced bladder smooth muscle cell (BSMC) fibrosis remain unclear. This study aimed to determine the regulatory role of circRNAs in the phenotypic changes in BSMCs in BOO-induced rats.circRNAmicroarray and real-time PCR were used to explore differentiated expressed circRNAs. Bioinformatics analyses and dual-luciferase reporter were performed to identify the targets for circRNA PVT1 (circPVT1). BOO was performed to establish a bladder fibrosis animal model. The circPVT1 and suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3) expression levels were upregulated (p = 0.0061 and 0.0328, respectively), whereas the microRNA-203a (miR-203) level was downregulated in rats with bladder remodeling (p=0.0085). Bioinformatics analyses and dual-luciferase reporter assay results confirmed that circPVT1 sponges miR-203 and that the latter targets the 3'-untranslated region of SOCS3. Additionally, circPVT1 knockdown alleviated BOO-induced bladder hypertrophy and fibrogenesis. Furthermore, hypoxia was induced in BSMCs to establish a cell model of bladder fibrosis. Hypoxia induction in BSMCs resulted in upregulated circPVT1 and SOCS3 levels (p = 0.0052) and downregulated miR-203 levels. Transfection with circPVT1 and SOCS3 shRNA ameliorated hypoxia-induced transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β1), TGFβR1, α-smooth muscle actin, fibrotic growth factor, extracellular matrix subtypes, BSMC proliferation, and apoptosis-associated cell injury, whereas co-transfection with miR-203 inhibitor counteracted the effect of circPVT1 shRNA on these phenotypes.These findings revealed a novel circRNA regulator of BOO-associated bladder wall remodeling and hypoxia-induced phenotypic changes in BMSCs by targeting the miR-203-SOCS3 signaling axis."
91,Reduction of acute gastric volvulus in a 3-year-old using a balloon-attached endoscope combined with gel immersion endoscopy,"Koji Yokoyama,Tomonori Yano,Hideki Kumagai,Yuko Okada,Yusuke Hashimoto,Shigeru Ono,Alan Kawarai Lefor,Takanori Yamagata,Koji Yokoyama,Tomonori Yano,Hideki Kumagai,Yuko Okada,Yusuke Hashimoto,Shigeru Ono,Alan Kawarai Lefor,Takanori Yamagata","When performing endoscopic reduction in patients with gastric volvulus, it is important to maintain a low level of intragastric pressure and to fix the endoscope in the duodenum. Gel immersion endoscopy is a new method for securing the visual field by injecting clear gel. The balloon-attached endoscope makes it easier to fix the tip in the duodenum without mucosal damage. We report successful reduction of a mesenteroaxial gastric volvulus using an endoscope with a balloon in combination with gel immersion endoscopy. A 3-year-old Japanese male developed gastric volvulus. Since gastric decompression using a nasogastric tube failed to reduce the volvulus, endoscopic reduction was performed under general anesthesia. After aspiration of intragastric gas, clear gel was injected through the accessory channel which secured the visual field in the stomach even with residue while maintaining low intragastric pressure. After reaching the descending portion of the duodenum, the balloon attached to the tip of the endoscope was inflated and fixed in the duodenum. The volvulus was successfully reduced by pulling back the endoscope with clockwise torque. Acute mesenteroaxial gastric volvulus has the potential to cause ischemia and perforation which can be life-threatening, so most patients are treated with surgical intervention. Gel immersion endoscopy is safe and effective to secure the visual field, even in children. Endoscopic reduction may be a viable treatment option for reducing gastric volvulus in non-emergent patients."
92,The impact of macroeconomic and financial development on carbon dioxide emissions in Pakistan: evidence with a novel dynamic simulated ARDL approach,"Khan, Muhammad Imran; Teng, Jian Zhou; Khan, Muhammad Kamran","This paper has empirically explored the impact of macroeconomic and financial development on CO(2)emissions by utilizing a novel dynamic simulated ARDL model for annual time series data from 1982 to 2018 for Pakistan. The results of a novel dynamic simulated ARDL disclosed that the growth of stock market, FDI, economic growth, and consumption of oil wield a positive impact on CO(2)emission, while domestic credit exerts a negative effect on CO(2)emission both in the short and the long run in Pakistan. The stock market development and domestic credit wield a significant influence on carbon dioxide emission in Pakistan both in the long and the short run. FDI exerts significant impact only in the long run, while economic growth and consumption of oil wield significant impact only in the short run on CO(2)emission in Pakistan. This study opens up new visions for the economy of Pakistan to sustain financial and economic growth by protecting environment from pollution through its efficient national environmental policy, fiscal policy, and monetary policy."

Its conventional recommended dose is 0.5-1.0 mg/kg per day to the cumulative dose of 120-150 mg/kg. To qualify the state of evidence and analyze the efficacy of the low-daily dose and the pulsed doses of isotretinoin in treating mild-to-moderate acne patients with regards to response and relapse rates. Systematic review and meta-analysis using an electronic literature search were performed. The 320 potentially relevant articles were included and reviewed. The level of evidence is moderate to low as conducted by the GRADE quality of evidence assessment. The pooled statistical estimate for response to treatment in the group comparing low-daily doses with conventional dose showed an overall benefit for conventional dose. On the other hand, pooled data from the group comparing the low-daily dose with the pulsed doses yielded an overall beneficial effect from using the low-daily dose compared with the pulsed doses on achieving the response. Given all of the available studies, the quality of evidence is low. It appears that conventional dose isotretinoin improves the odds of prolonged remission in adults with mild-to-moderate acne vulgaris compared to the low doses."
94,The Noctambuli: tales of sleepwalkers and secrets of the body in seventeenth-century England,"Elizabeth Hunter,Elizabeth Hunter","Seventeenth-century readers were fascinated by marvellous tales of people known as the noctambuli who rose up in their sleep, performed daily chores and attempted dangerous feats, such as clambering onto rooftops. On account of their uncanny nature, commentators noted that sleepers could be mistaken for spectres or those who had been bewitched. Depictions of the noctamubli were also influenced by the Malleus Maleficarum, which had argued that they were acting under the influence of demons and would fall if their Christian name was called. Medical texts explained this behaviour in terms of the escape of hot vapours within the body, the powers of the imaginative faculty, and the impairment of common sense during sleep. While this explanation was widely accepted, in the 1650s it was challenged by alternative views from esoteric writings, which conceptualised the movements of sleepers in terms of mystical powers within the body."
95,Benign mixed Müllerian (duct) vaginal tumor in a 12-y-old goat,"Svenja Hartung,Elfi K Schlohsarczyk,Alexandra Jost,Marlene Sickinger,Kernt Köhler,Svenja Hartung,Elfi K Schlohsarczyk,Alexandra Jost,Marlene Sickinger,Kernt Köhler","In human and veterinary medicine, mixed Müllerian tumors (MMTs) are rarely diagnosed neoplasms of the tubular female genital tract. Although there are case reports of malignant MMTs in various species, benign MMTs have only been described once in a macaque. Here we present a case of benign MMT in a 12-y-old goat, and review the literature on uterine, cervical, and vaginal neoplasia in goats. The doe was presented with vaginal discharge and was euthanized because of the high suspicion of intraabdominal neoplasia. On gross examination, an ulcerated vaginal mass was identified. Histologically, 2 distinct cell populations were present: smooth muscle cells that were well differentiated and positive for alpha-smooth muscle actin, and ciliated columnar epithelial cells that lined ductal structures and had no signs of malignancy. These findings led to the diagnosis of neoplasia of Müllerian origin. Benign MMT should be considered as a differential diagnosis for uterine and vaginal neoplasms in goats."
96,The risk of stent thrombosis of dual antithrombotic therapy for patients who require oral anticoagulant undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention: insights of a meta-analysis of randomized trials,"Toshiki Kuno,Hiroki Ueyama,Hisato Takagi,Sripal Bangalore,Toshiki Kuno,Hiroki Ueyama,Hisato Takagi,Sripal Bangalore","Recent meta-analyses investigating dual antithrombotic therapy (DAT) versus triple antithrombotic therapy (TAT) among patients who require oral anticoagulants especially with atrial fibrillation (AF) undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) raised the concern of stent thrombosis (ST) and myocardial infarction (MI), however, these meta-analyses did not include all randomized trials who require oral anticoagulants. We aimed to investigate the efficacy of DAT versus TAT in these patients undergoing PCI. Our data showed the risk of ST was not significantly different in DAT vs. TAT (HR [95%CI]: 1.50 [0.97-2.34], p = .07; I2 = 0%) and MI (HR [95%CI]: 1.17 [0.95-1.45], p = .14; I2 = 0%)."
97,Prediction of biogas production rate from anaerobic hybrid reactor by artificial neural network and nonlinear regressions models,"Tufaner, Fatih; Demirci, Yavuz","In the present study, a three-layer artificial neural network (ANN) and nonlinear regression models were developed to predict the performance of biogas production from the anaerobic hybrid reactor (AHR). Firstly, the performance of an AHR which is filled with perlite (2.38-4.36 mm) at fill rates of 1/3, 1/4 and 1/5 for the treatment of synthetic wastewater was investigated at a loading rate of 5, 7.5, 10, 12.5 and 15 kg COD m(-3) day with 12, 24, 36 and 48 h of hydraulic retention time (HRT) under mesophilic conditions (37 +/- 1 degrees C). In this study, experimental data were used to estimate the biogas production rate with models produced using both ANNs and nonlinear regression methods. Moreover, ten related variables, such as reactor fill ratio, influent pH, effluent pH, influent alkalinity, effluent alkalinity, organic loading rate, effluent chemical oxygen demand, effluent total suspended solids, effluent suspended solids and effluent volatile suspended solids, were selected as inputs of the model. Finally, ANN and nonlinear regression models describing the biogas production rate were developed. The R-2, IA, FA2, RMSE, MB for ANNs and nonlinear regression models were found to be 0.9852 and 0.9878, 0.9956 and 0.9945, 0.9973 and 0.9254, 217.4 and 332, 36 and 222, respectively. The statistical quality of ANNs and nonlinear regression models were found to be significant due to its high correlation between experimental and simulated biogas values. The ANN model generally showed greater potential in determining the relationship between input data and the biogas production rate according to statistical parameters (except R-2 and R). The results showed that the proposed ANNs and nonlinear regression models performed well in predicting the biogas production rate of AHR on behalf of avoiding economic and environmental sustainability problems.

98,The essential role of fungal peroxisomes in plant infection,"Christian Falter,Sigrun Reumann,Christian Falter,Sigrun Reumann","Several filamentous fungi are ecologically and economically important plant pathogens that infect a broad variety of crops. They cause high annual yield losses and contaminate seeds and fruits with mycotoxins. Not only powerful infection structures and detrimental toxins, but also cell organelles, such as peroxisomes, play important roles in plant infection. In this review, we summarize recent research results that revealed novel peroxisomal functions of filamentous fungi and highlight the importance of peroxisomes for infection of host plants. Central for fungal virulence are two primary metabolic pathways, fatty acid β-oxidation and the glyoxylate cycle, both of which are required to produce energy, acetyl-CoA, and carbohydrates. These are ultimately needed for the synthesis of cell wall polymers and for turgor generation in infection structures. Most novel results stem from different routes of secondary metabolism and demonstrate that peroxisomes produce important precursors and house various enzymes needed for toxin production and melanization of appressoria. All these peroxisomal functions in fungal virulence might represent elegant targets for improved crop protection."

Herein, considering the current progress of ultrasound imaging in accurately assessing the superficial soft tissues of the human body; it is noteworthy that ultrasound examination has the potential to augment the diagnostic process. In this sense/report, briefly revisiting the most common clinical maneuvers described in the pertinent literature, the authors try to match them with possible (static and dynamic) sonographic assessment techniques to exemplify/propose an 'ultrasound-guided' physical examination for different tissues in the evaluation of lymphedema."
100,Management of traumatic brain injury: a narrative review of current evidence,"M D Wiles,M D Wiles","Globally, approximately 70 million people sustain traumatic brain injury each year and this can have significant physical, psychosocial and economic consequences for patients, their families and society. The aim of this review is to provide clinicians with a summary of recent studies of direct relevance to the management of traumatic brain injury in order to promote best clinical practice. The use of tranexamic acid in the management of traumatic brain injury has been the focus of several studies, with one large randomised controlled trial suggesting a reduction in all-cause mortality within 24 h of injury. The use of therapeutic hypothermia does not improve neurological outcomes and maintenance of normothermia remains the optimal management strategy. For seizure management, levetiracetam appears to be as effective as phenytoin, but the optimal dose remains unclear. There has been a lack of clear outcome benefit for any individual osmotherapy agent, with no difference in mortality or neurological recovery. Early tracheostomy (< 7 days from injury) for patients with traumatic brain injury is associated with a reduction in the incidence of ventilator-associated pneumonia and duration of mechanical ventilation, critical care and hospital stay. Further research is needed in order to determine the optimal package of care and interventions. There is a need for research studies to focus on patient-centred outcome measures such as long-term neurological recovery and quality of life."

The authors used the modern methods of normalisation, threshold vector determination, and dynamic weight coefficients in order to identify the level of social safety of society. The authors developed the structure and a list of indicators considering three components of social safety: The standard of living, the demographic component, and the quality of life. This method allows determining the list and severity of threats, comparing the dynamics of integral indices with integral thresholds in one scale, identifying the state of security, and defining strategic goals and strategies. The suggested approach is universal and can be used by any country, region, economic activity, or business to develop evidence-based medium-to-long-term sustainable development scenarios."
103,Physiology and pathophysiology of human airway mucus,"David B Hill,Brian Button,Michael Rubinstein,Richard C Boucher,David B Hill,Brian Button,Michael Rubinstein,Richard C Boucher","The mucus clearance system is the dominant mechanical host defense system of the human lung. Mucus is cleared from the lung by cilia and airflow, including both two-phase gas-liquid pumping and cough-dependent mechanisms, and mucus transport rates are heavily dependent on mucus concentration. Importantly, mucus transport rates are accurately predicted by the gel-on-brush model of the mucociliary apparatus from the relative osmotic moduli of the mucus and periciliary-glycocalyceal (PCL-G) layers. The fluid available to hydrate mucus is generated by transepithelial fluid transport. Feedback interactions between mucus concentrations and cilia beating, via purinergic signaling, coordinate Na+ absorptive vs Cl- secretory rates to maintain mucus hydration in health. In disease, mucus becomes hyperconcentrated (dehydrated). Multiple mechanisms derange the ion transport pathways that normally hydrate mucus in muco-obstructive lung diseases, e.g., cystic fibrosis (CF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), non-CF bronchiectasis (NCFB), and primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD). A key step in muco-obstructive disease pathogenesis is the osmotic compression of the mucus layer onto the airway surface with the formation of adherent mucus plaques and plugs, particularly in distal airways. Mucus plaques create locally hypoxic conditions and produce airflow obstruction, inflammation, infection, and, ultimately, airway wall damage. Therapies to clear adherent mucus with hydrating and mucolytic agents are rational, and strategies to develop these agents are reviewed."

Using an appropriate transmission function, we estimate the impact of the third surge of COVID-19 in Italy. Also, we assess two different vaccination programmes. In one of them, a single shot is administered to all citizens over 16 years old before second shots are available. In the second model, first and second shots are administered to each citizen within, approximately, 20 days of time-gap."
105,Hymen and virginity: What every paediatrician should know,"Dehlia Moussaoui,Jasmine Abdulcadir,Michal Yaron,Dehlia Moussaoui,Jasmine Abdulcadir,Michal Yaron","Paediatricians may face the notion of 'virginity' in various situations while caring for children and adolescents, but are often poorly prepared to address this sensitive topic. Virginity is a social construct. Despite medical evidence that there is no scientifically reliable way to determine virginity, misconceptions about the hymen and its supposed association with sexual history persist and lead to unethical practices like virginity testing, certificate of virginity or hymenoplasty, which can be detrimental to the health and well-being of females of all ages. The paediatrician has a crucial role in providing evidence-based information and promoting positive sexual education to children, adolescents and parents. Improving knowledge can help counter misconceptions and reduce harms to girls and women."

Herein, we report the first highly enantioselective radical-based manifold. Under a dual organocatalyst system involving a chiral phosphoric acid and DPZ as the photoredox sensitizer, transformations of N-arylglycines, in which aryls with CF3 substituents are introduced, with alkenyl azaarenes afforded valuable hydroaminoalkylation adducts with satisfactory results. In addition to the diversity of azaarenes, the method can be used to construct aryl-, alkyl- and silyl-substituted stereocenter. Control experiments and density functional theory calculations were performed to elucidate a plausible reaction mechanism and the origin of stereoselectivity, wherein nonclassical H-bonding interactions were found to assist chiral catalysts in offering sufficient enantiocontrol."
107,Assessment of tumor burden and response to therapy in patients with colorectal cancer using a quantitative ctDNA test for methylated BCAT1/IKZF1,"Erin L Symonds,Susanne K Pedersen,Bernita Yeo,Hiba Al Naji,Susan E Byrne,Amitesh Roy,Graeme P Young,Erin L Symonds,Susanne K Pedersen,Bernita Yeo,Hiba Al Naji,Susan E Byrne,Amitesh Roy,Graeme P Young","Failure of colorectal cancer (CRC) treatment is due to residual disease, and its timely identification is critical for patient survival. Detecting CRC-associated mutations in patient circulating cell-free DNA is confounded by tumor mutation heterogeneity, requiring primary tumor sequencing to identify relevant mutations. In this study, we assessed BCAT1 and IKZF1 methylation levels to quantify circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) and investigated whether this method can be used to assess tumor burden and efficacy of therapy. In 175 patients with CRC who were ctDNA-positive pretreatment, ctDNA levels were higher with advancing stage (P < 0.05) and correlated with tumor diameter (r = 0.35, P < 0.001) and volume (r = 0.58, P < 0.01). After completion of treatment (median of 70 days [IQR 49-109] after surgery, +/- radiotherapy, +/- chemotherapy), ctDNA levels were reduced in 98% (47/48) and were undetectable in 88% (42/48) of patients tested. For those with incomplete adjuvant chemotherapy after surgery, roughly half remained ctDNA-positive (11/21, 52.4%). The presence of ctDNA after treatment was associated with disease progression (HR 9.7, 95%CI 2.5-37.6) compared to no ctDNA. Assaying blood for ctDNA methylated in BCAT1/IKZF1 has the potential for identifying residual disease due to treatment failure, informing a potential need for therapy adjustment in advanced disease."
108,Medullary bone in male budgerigars ( Melopsittacus undulatus) with testicular neoplasms,"Nathan K Hoggard,Linden E Craig,Nathan K Hoggard,Linden E Craig","Medullary bone is a calcium-rich, labile bone normally occurring in female birds with each egg-laying cycle. The stimulus for formation of medullary bone is, in part, the cyclic increase in serum estrogens produced by preovulatory ovarian follicles. Increased bone density due to formation of medullary bone, particularly in pneumatic bones, has been termed polyostotic hyperostosis, even if physiologic. This study investigated the formation of medullary bone in nonpneumatic (femur) and pneumatic (humerus) bones in sexually mature male budgerigars submitted for autopsy. Of the 21 sexually mature male budgerigars submitted for autopsy, 7 (33%) had medullary bone in 1 or more bones examined. All 7 male budgerigars with medullary bone had a testicular neoplasm, which was morphologically consistent with a testicular sustentacular cell tumor, seminoma, or interstitial cell tumor. Medullary bone was not present in the 14 cases with other diseases. Medullary bone formation in pneumatic and nonpneumatic bones can occur in male budgerigars with testicular neoplasms. Radiographic increases in medullary bone density, particularly in the humerus, could provide antemortem indication of testicular neoplasia in male budgerigars."
109,Removal of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) emitted from a textile dyeing wastewater treatment plant and the attenuation of respiratory health risks using a pilot-scale biofilter,"Liang, Zhishu; Wang, Jijun; Zhang, Yuna; Han, Cheng; Ma, Shengtao; Chen, Jiangyao; Li, Guiying; An, Taicheng","The textile dyeing is a significant worldwide economic pillar of the industry mainstay of the region's industrial economy. Therefore, significant attention should be paid to its emitted volatile organic compounds (VOCs) regarding their potential adverse effects on ecosystems and human health. In this study, a spray tower (ST) (preferential elimination of hydrosoluble VOCs) and biofilter (primary removal of particle-free VOCs) were used in combination. Three techniques, including gas chromatography-mass spectrometer (GC-MS), e-nose, and Proton transfer reaction time-of-flight mass spectrometry (PTR-TOF-MS) were used to accurately identify the associated VOCs profile. In total, 50 types of VOCs, with total concentrations ranging from 1.26 to 2.79 mg M-3, were detected from the outlet of the TDWTP over a 90-day treatment period. The highest level occurred for nitrogen- and oxygen-containing compounds (NAOCCs), followed by aliphatic hydrocarbons (AIHs), aromatic hydrocarbons (AHs), and halogenated hydrocarbons (HHs). Average removal efficiencies (REs) of the four studied VOC groups (NAOCCs, AIHs, AHs, and HHs) were 66.7%, 67.9%, 11.7%, and 52.1%, respectively. Proteobacteria dominated the biofilter, followed by Actinobacteria, Firmicutes, and Bacteroidetes. A positive correlation was observed between the relative abundance of Proteobacteria and the RE of NAOCCs, with RE significantly increased from 38.1% (day 1) to 83.2% (day 90). The degradation of these organic pollutants, such as NAOCCs, may be mainly performed by the dominant genus, such as Acidithiobacillus and Metallibacterium, as predicted by PICRUSt. A respiratory health risk evaluation demonstrated that the cancer and non-cancer risks of typical VOCs were dramatically reduced after the above-mentioned purification. The combined results indicate that the ST-biofilter is an efficient approach for the end-of-pipe treatment of exhausted gas in TDWTP and helps attenuate human health risk. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

110,Estimating health burden and economic loss attributable to short-term exposure to multiple air pollutants in China,"Yao, Minghong; Wu, Gonghua; Zhao, Xing; Zhang, Juying","Existing studies focused on the evaluation of health burden of long-term exposure to air pollutants, whereas limited information is available on short-term exposure, particularly in China. Air pollutant concentrations in 338 Chinese cities in 2017 were used to estimate the air pollutants related health burden which was defined as premature mortalities from all-cause, cardiovascular and respiratory disease as well as hospital admissions for cardiovascular and respiratory disease. Log-linear model was used as the exposure-response function to estimate the health burden attributable to each air pollutant. The value of statistical life and cost of illness methods were used to estimate economic loss of the premature mortalities and hospital admissions, respectively. The national all-cause premature mortalities attributable to all air pollutants was 1.35 million, accounting for 17.2% of reported deaths in China in 2017. Among all-cause premature mortality, contributions of PM2.5, PM2.5-10, NO2, SO2, O-3 and CO werel 11.1%, 5.2%, 28.9%, 9.6%, 23.0%, and 22.2%, respectively. The national cardiovascular and respiratory premature mortalities were 0.77 and 0.21 million, respectively. About 7.8 million cardiovascular and respiratory disease hospital admissions were attributed to short-term exposure to all air pollutants. The economic loss of the overall health burden (premature mortality and hospital admissions) was 2065.54 billion Yuan, which was equivalent to 2.5% of the national GDP in 2017. The health burden and economic loss attributable to short-term exposure to ambient air pollutant are substantial in China. It suggested that the adverse health effects attributable to short-term exposure to air pollutant should not be neglected in China. In order to reduce the health impact of air pollution, each city should develop air pollution prevention and control measures based on existing scientific evidence."

Owais; Munir, Anjum","Hybrid renewable energy systems (HRES) are becoming popular as stand-alone power systems for providing electricity in remote areas due to the advancement in renewable energy technologies and subsequent rise in the prices of conventional fuels. A hybrid energy system, or hybrid power, usually consists of two or more renewable energy sources used together to provide increased system efficiency as well as greater balance in energy supply. Therefore, this paper aims at the design optimization of the hybrid renewable energy systems to meet the specific daily residential load profile for remote areas. The optimization problem regarding the design of a hybrid renewable energy system has been solved using Homer Pro Software depending on demand-side management during peak and off-peak hours. Four cases are used to evaluate the performance of the proposed design scheme. The simulation results have shown that the proposed design scheme is suitable for remote areas in comparison to the earlier proposed systems depicted in four cases. In addition, a properly planned hybrid system with demand-side management will reduce the overall system cost and increase the system efficiency by reducing carbon emissions, balancing power system by managing overloading and reduction in load shedding as well as less complex design and easy implementation in remote areas."
112,Efficient irrigation water allocation and its impact on agricultural sustainability and water scarcity under uncertainty,"Li, Mo; Xu, Yaowen; Fu, Qiang; Singh, Vijay P.; Liu, Dong; Li, Tianxiao","Agriculture is a key economic sector in developing countries that are facing challenges of low efficiency of water resources utilization and of shrinking water supply. This study develops an optimization model for the allocation of agricultural irrigation water to improve irrigation water use efficiency (IWUE), considering uncertainties of fluctuating water supply. Then, it assesses the impact of efficient water allocation on the sustainability and water scarcity under different levels of water supply. This study can help answer questions as to how to optimal allocate limited water supplies to different crops and different subareas under uncertainty to improve IWUE, how water shortage affects economic, social, and environmental aspects, and what the relationship between system sustainability and water shortage is. To demonstrate its feasibility, the proposed models are applied to an irrigation district in northeastern China. These models can also be applied to other regions that suffer from water scarcity. Results of application are found to be satisfactory for explaining the impact of agricultural irrigation water allocation on net economic benefit, water resources allocation equity, total greenhouse gas emissions, and water scarcity footprint under different water supply conditions. This study provides insights into tradeoffs amongst resources, economy, society, and environment in irrigated agricultural systems under uncertainty."

Dietary interventions or nutraceuticals may provide efficacious treatments through prevention and cure. Soybean meal, a byproduct of soy oil refining, has health benefits, but its effect on memory function is unknown. Therefore, we evaluated the effect of the oral administration of soybean meal extract (SME) for 2 weeks on memory function using the Morris water maze (MWM) test in healthy rats and investigated the possible underlying mechanisms. First, analysis of the composition revealed that SME is rich in isoflavones; SME did not exhibit hepatotoxicity or renal toxicity at the different doses tested. The MWM results revealed that the escape latency and movement distance of rats were significantly shorter in the SME group than in the control group, indicating that SME can help in memory preservation. In addition, SME increased the levels of presynaptic proteins such as synaptophysin, synaptobrevin, synaptotagmin, syntaxin, synapsin I, and 25-kDa synaptosome-associated protein as well as protein kinases and their phosphorylated expression, including extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2), protein kinase C (PKC), and Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) in the hippocampal nerve terminals (synaptosomes). Transmission electron microscopy also indicated that SME increased the number of synaptic vesicles in hippocampal synaptosomes. Furthermore, SME rats exhibited altered microbiota composition compared with control rats. Therefore, our data suggest that SME can increase presynaptic function and modulate gut microbiota, thus aiding in memory preservation in rats."

In vitro, CC-90001 glucuronidation was catalysed by UGT1A9, UGT1A4, and UGT1A1, while oxidative metabolism was primarily mediated by CYP3A4/5 with minor contributions from CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2B6, and CYP2D6.CC-90001 in vitro inhibits CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4 ≤ 55% at 100 μM, and the inhibition was negligible at ≤30 μM. CC-90001 is not a time-dependent CYP inhibitor.In human hepatocytes CC-90001 is an inducer of CYP2B6 and CYP3A, with mRNA levels increased 34.4% to 52.8% relative to positive controls.In vitro CC-90001 is a substrate of P-gp, and an inhibitor of P-gp, BCRP, OAT3, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OCT2, MATE1, and MATE2k with IC50 values of 30.3, 25.8, 17.7, 0.417, 19.9, 0.605, 4.17, and 20 μM, respectively.A clinical study demonstrated that CC-90001 has no or little impact on the exposure of warfarin (CYP2C9), omeprazole (CYP2C19), midazolam (CYP3A) or metformin (OCT2, MATE1/2k). CC-90001 co-administration increases the AUCt and Cmax 176% and 339% for rosuvastatin (BCRP/OATP1B1/3), 116% and 171% for digoxin (P-gp), and 266% and 321% for nintedanib (CYP3A & P-gp), respectively.In conclusion, CC-90001 in unlikely to be a victim or perpetrator of clinically relevant interactions involving CYPs or UGTs. Weak to moderate interactions are expected in clinic with substrates of P-gp and OATP1B1 due to CC-90001 inhibition of these transporters."
115,Globalization and CO(2)emissions nexus: evidence from the EKC hypothesis in South Asian countries,"Mehmood, Usman; Tariq, Salman","In the last few decades, developing countries continued to increase their manufacturing industries' phenomenal growth rate. Due to the emergence of globalization, these developing countries are getting economic growth at the cost of environmental pollution. In this context, the extent of linkages between globalization and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions has been investigated over the time period of 1972-2013 in South Asian countries. The econometric and graphical analyses are found U-shape association between globalization and CO(2)emissions in Nepal, Afghanistan, Bangladesh, and Sri Lanka, and an inverted U-shape relationship is observed in Pakistan and Bhutan. Moreover, results have shown that there exists a bi-directional causality between globalization and CO(2)emissions in Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Nepal. This indicates that globalization is increasing CO(2)emissions and CO(2)emissions impact globalization by economic growth. However, after some threshold level, globalization is responsible for decreasing CO(2)emissions in Pakistan and Bhutan. For the first time, globalization is incorporated in the economic analysis, showing the U-shape and inverted U-shape associations between globalization and CO(2)emissions. This study suggests some strong policy recommendations to consider globalization as cost-effective tool to achieve sustainable economic growth in South Asian countries."
116,Techno-economic assessment of coal- or biomass-fired oxy-combustion power plants with supercritical carbon dioxide cycle,"Wei, Xiaoyu; Manovic, Vasilije; Hanak, Dawid P.","Oxy-fuel combustion is regarded as a feasible technology that can contribute towards decarbonisation of the power industry. Although it has been shown that oxy-fuel combustion results in lower carbon dioxide emissions at a lower cost of carbon dioxide captured compared to the mature amine scrubbing process, its implementation still results in high economic penalties. This study proposes to replace the conventional steam cycle in the state-of-the-art oxy-combustion coal-fired power plants with the supercritical carbon dioxide cycle to reduce both economic and efficiency penalties. In addition, in order to further reduce carbon dioxide emissions, biomass is considered as a replacement fuel for coal in the oxy-fuel combustion power plant and the proposed process becomes a type of bio-energy with carbon capture and storage. The process models were developed in Aspen Plus (TM) to assess techno-economic feasibility of the considered processes. The results showed that on replacement of the conventional steam cycle with the supercritical carbon dioxide cycle, the efficiency penalties were reduced by up to 2% points and the levelised cost of electricity was reduced up to 4.6% (4.1 (sic)/MWh). Moreover, when biomass was used as a fuel, the net efficiency penalties increased by 0.5% points and the levelised cost of electricity increased by 24.4 (sic)/MWh. Although techno-economic performance in this case was less favourable under no carbon tax conditions, using biomass resulted in significant negative carbon dioxide emissions (-3.70 megatonnes of carbon dioxide per annum). Such negative emissions can offset carbon dioxide emissions from other sources that are relatively difficult to decarbonise. If the carbon tax is above 24 (sic) per tonne of carbon dioxide, bio-energy with carbon capture and storage became more economically feasible than fossil fuel with carbon capture and storage."

We sought to investigate which components of the glomerular filtration barrier could be involved in the antiproteinuric and renoprotective effects of SGLT2 inhibition in diabetes. BTBR (black and tan, brachyuric) ob/ob mice that develop a type 2 diabetic nephropathy received a standard diet with or without empagliflozin for 10 weeks, starting at 8 weeks of age, when animals had developed albuminuria. Empagliflozin caused marked decreases in blood glucose levels and albuminuria but did not correct glomerular hyperfiltration. The protective effect of empagliflozin against albuminuria was not due to a reduction in podocyte damage as empagliflozin did not affect the larger podocyte filtration slit pore size nor the defective expression of nephrin and nestin. Empagliflozin did not reduce the thickening of the glomerular basement membrane. In BTBR ob/ob mice, the most profound abnormality seen using electron microscopy was in the endothelial aspect of the glomerular capillary, with significant loss of endothelial fenestrations. Remarkably, empagliflozin ameliorated the subverted microvascular endothelial ultrastructure. Caveolae and bridging diaphragms between adjacent endothelial fenestrae were seen in diabetic mice and associated with increased expression of caveolin-1 and the appearance of PV-1. These endothelial abnormalities were limited by the SGLT2 inhibitor. Although no expression of SGLT2 was found in glomerular endothelial cells, SGLT2 was expressed in the podocytes of diabetic mice. VEGF-A, which is a known stimulus for endothelial caveolin-1 and PV-1, was increased in podocytes of BTBR ob/ob mice and normalized by SGLT2 inhibitor treatment. Thus, empagliflozin's protective effect on the glomerular endothelium of diabetic mice could be due to a limitation of the paracrine signaling of podocyte-derived VEGF-A that resulted in a reduction of the abnormal endothelial caveolin-1 and PV-1, with the consequent preservation of glomerular endothelial function and permeability. © 2022 The Pathological Society of Great Britain and Ireland."
118,CO2 utilization: Turning greenhouse gas into fuels and valuable products,"Anwar, M. N.; Fayyaz, A.; Sohail, N. F.; Khokhar, M. F.; Baqar, M.; Yasar, A.; Rasool, K.; Nazir, A.; Raja, M. U. F.; Rehan, M.; Aghbashlo, M.; Tabatabaei, M.; Nizami, A. S.","This study critically reviews the recent developments and future opportunities pertinent to the conversion of CO2 as a potent greenhouse gas (GHG) to fuels and valuable products. CO2 emissions have reached an alarming level of around 410 ppm and have become the primary driver of global warming and climate change leading to devastating events such as droughts, hurricanes, torrential rains, floods, tornados and wildfires across the world. These events are responsible for thousands of deaths and have adversely affected the economic development of many countries, loss of billions of dollars, across the globe. One of the promising choices to tackle this issue is carbon sequestration by pre- and post-combustion processes and oxyfuel combustion. The captured CO2 can be converted into fuels and valuable products, including methanol, dirnethyl ether (DINE), and methane (CH4). The efficient use of the sequestered CO2 for the desalinization might be critical in overcoming water scarcity and energy issues in developing countries. Using the sequestered CO2 to produce algae in combination with waste-water, and producing biofuels is among the promising strategies. Many methods, like direct combustion, fermentation, transesterification, pyrolysis, anaerobic digestion (AD), and gasification, can be used for the conversion of algae into biofuel. Direct air capturing (DAC) is another productive technique for absorbing CO2 from the atmosphere and converting it into various useful energy resources like CH4. These methods can effectively tackle the issues of climate change, water security, and energy crises. However, future research is required to make these conversion methods cost-effective and commercially applicable."

A total of 816 patients were included in the study, the patients who received aspirin aged 60-69 (29.65%), followed by patients aged 50-59 years old (29.53%) and 70-79 years old (22.91%). Demographic information shown that the majority of the patients were males (58.55%). The BMI revealed that 85.78% of patients were obese. The majority of the patients have diabetes 78.67%, hypertension 74.38%, and dyslipidemia 65.68%. The mean systolic blood pressure was 136 ± 7.4 and diastolic blood pressure was 74.9 ± 5.2. After applying aspirin candidacy calculation, only 6% patients were highly recommended to be on aspirin, 49% patients had reasonable recommendation of aspirin, 27% patients use aspirin based on ""may be considered"" recommendation, and 23% patients were on aspirin with no indication or recommendation. The study highlights the importance of following the international recommendations in aspirin prescribing, and flags the inappropriate use and prescribing by our healthcare providers. The current study encourages further investigation to be carried out which should include patient and clinician education, to well understand and alleviate the inequalities in aspirin use and adherence. Further studies are also warranted to understand of the prescribing pattern and to provide solutions to avoid aspirin associated complications."

The plausibility of the expressed plant is substantiated with regarding economic, thermodynamic and environmental concepts as the utmost efficacious equipment for operating evaluation of the thermal systems. An ejector refrigeration system beside a PEM electrolyzer are employed for cooling and hydrogen production. Furthermore, a heat recovery heat exchanger is employed for heating purposes. All subsystems are cautiously investigated and validated considering the reliable reports. The findings portrayed that the introduced multigeneration system can generate cooling load, heating capacity, net output power, and H-21 rate of 84.421kW, 2771kW, 184.21kW, and 1.4331kg/h, respectively. In this occasion, the first-law efficiency, exergetic efficiency, product overall cost, and environmental penalty cost are calculated 79.57%, 33.92%, 897.7 $/GJ, and 0.3527 $/h, respectively. Also, among all constituents, the superior portion of exergy destruction attributed to the solid oxide fuel cell module by 783.31kW, approximately 35.6% of the overall exergy destruction rate. Meantime, a thoroughgoing parametric evaluation of the set-up is established and it is illustrated that the suggested multigeneration plant's exergetic efficiency can be maximized according to the inlet temperature of the solid oxide fuel cell unit, compression ratio, and solid oxide fuel cell current density. Moreover, the product cost rate of the plant can be minimized with ejector motive fluid pressure, solid oxide fuel cell inlet temperature, and gas turbine outlet pressure. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Due to the complexity of the marine environment, researchers considered it as a new field to search for compounds with therapeutic efficacy, marine sponges represents the milestone in the discovery of unique compounds of potent activities against parasitic infections. In the present article, literatures published from 2010 until March 2021 were screened to review antiparasitic potency of bioactive compounds extracted from marine sponges. 45 different genera of sponges have been studied for their antiparasitic activities. The antiparasitic activity of the crude extract or the compounds that have been isolated from marine sponges were assayed in vitro against Plasmodium falciparum, P. berghei, Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense, T. b. brucei, T. cruzi, Leishmania donovani, L. tropica, L. infantum, L. amazonesis, L. major, L. panamesis, Haemonchus contortus and Schistosoma mansoni. The majority of antiparastic compounds extracted from marine sponges were related to alkaloids and peroxides represent the second important group of antiparasitic compounds extracted from sponges followed by terpenoids. Some substances have been extracted and used as antiparasitic agents to a lesser extent like steroids, amino acids, lipids, polysaccharides and isonitriles. The activities of these isolated compounds against parasites were screened using in vitro techniques. Compounds' potent activity in screened papers was classified in three categories according to IC50: low active or inactive, moderately active and good potent active."
123,Plastoquinone homeostasis in plant acclimation to light intensity,"Brigitte Ksas,Jean Alric,Stefano Caffarri,Michel Havaux,Brigitte Ksas,Jean Alric,Stefano Caffarri,Michel Havaux","Arabidopsis plants were grown from seeds at different photon flux densities (PFDs) of white light ranging from 65 to 800 µmol photons m-2 s-1. Increasing PFD brought about a marked accumulation of plastoquinone (PQ) in leaves. However, the thylakoid photoactive PQ pool, estimated to about 700 pmol mg-1 leaf dry weight, was independent of PFD; PQ accumulation in high light mostly occurred in the photochemically non-active pool (plastoglobules, chloroplast envelopes) which represented up to 75% of total PQ. The amounts of PSII reaction center (on a leaf dry weight basis) also were little affected by PFD during growth, leading to a constant PQ/PSII ratio at all PFDs. Boosting PQ biosynthesis by overexpression of a solanesyl diphosphate-synthesizing enzyme strongly enhanced the PQ levels, particularly at high PFDs. Again, this accumulation occurred exclusively in the non-photoactive PQ pool. Mutational suppression of the plastoglobular ABC1K1 kinase led to a selective reduction of the thylakoid PQ pool size to ca. 400 pmol mg-1 in a large range of PFDs, which was associated with a restriction of the photosynthetic electron flow. Our results show that photosynthetic acclimation to light intensity does not involve modulation of the thylakoid PQ pool size or the amounts of PSII reaction centers. There appears to be a fixed amount of PQ molecules for optimal interaction with PSII and efficient photosynthesis, with the extra PQ molecules being stored outside the thylakoid membranes, implying a tight regulation of PQ distribution within the chloroplasts."
124,Enhancement of early-age strength of the high content fly ash blended cement paste by sodium sulfate and C-S-H seeds towards a greener binder,"Zou, Fubing; Hu, Chuanlin; Wang, Fazhou; Ruan, Yunxing; Hu, Shuguang","Due to the economic and environmental benefits, the industry by-products like fly ash have been intensively employed to partially substitute cement in concrete and other cementitious materials. However, with the increased substitution level of cement by fly ash, the major drawback is the low early-age strength of cement paste owing to the slow pozzolanic reaction of fly ash. This study aims to accelerate the early-age strength of high content fly ash blended cement paste using sodium sulfate and calcium silicate hydrate (C-S-H) seeds. The results show that sodium sulfate and C-S-H seeds exhibit a synergistic enhancement effect on the early-age strength of high content fly ash blended cement paste, which is much higher than the sum of individual effects of sodium sulfate and C-S-H seeds. Therefore, the high replacement of cement by fly ash towards a greener binder can be achieved by the application of sodium sulfate and C-S-H seeds. Moreover, the underlying mechanism of the synergistic effect is revealed through this study. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."

These behaviors may also hinder positive family interactions and have a significant impact on parents and other family members. Although various parent training approaches exist to increase parents' capacity to address these challenging behaviors, many parents are reportedly not able to access training due to time and resource constraints. To address inequitable dissemination of information, we developed and piloted the use of the Challenging Behavior Online Modules with 10 parents of children with disabilities. In particular, we examined the feasibility of the Challenging Behavior Online Modules for increasing parents' knowledge and use of positive parenting practices with their young children. Parents reported satisfaction with the contents and delivery method of the intervention. Implications and directions for future research are also suggested."
126,Optimisation of cascade reservoir operation considering environmental flows for different environmental management classes,"Suwal, Naresh; Huang, Xianfeng; Kuriqi, Alban; Chen, Yingqin; Pandey, Kamal Prasad; Bhattarai, Khem Prasad","Most commonly, hydropower operation focused on the economic and social benefits of the humankind, whereas neglecting the riverine ecosystem conservation. This conventional approach of operation led to the degradation of the riverine ecosystem. As research progressed, adoption of natural flow variability in the operation of reservoir gained momentum. Flow variability is a major driver of the healthy river ecosystem, whereby discharging a certain amount of water could potentially reduce the adverse effect of reservoirs and dams on the riverine ecosystem. On this preface, the study presented here constitutes a multi-objective optimisation model of cascade reservoirs to maximise the power generation while minimising the shortage of environmental flows considering five environmental management classes. This paper analyses the case studies for Liujiaping-Yumitan cascade reservoirs. The environmental flows regarding each environmental management classes were calculated using ""Global Environmental Flow Calculator"", the model was solved using an anon-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II). The NSGA-II helps to find Pareto optimal sets of solutions, NSGA-II, however, cannot be used solely for taking a comprehensive decision. Therefore, the Projection Pursuit Cluster (PPC) model has been used additionally for the optimal sequencing of the compromised optimal solutions. The maximum annual power production considering five environmental management classes were respectively: 1.121, 1.109, 1.103, 1.109, and 1.117 (x10(8) kWh) with environmental flows shortage of 2060.82, 616.497, 200.52, 28.88, and 0.004 (x10(4) m(3)) respectively. Findings resulted from this study, highlight the necessity for power production compromise for a better degree of environmental protection. In contrast, the environmental benefit is more important not only for the sustainable operation of the hydropower but also for fulfilling the universal needs of the riverine ecosystem. Therefore, the outcomes of this study can be a guideline for decision-makers to improve the comprehensive benefits of the Liujiaping-Yumitan cascade hydropower station along with the conservation of the environmental health of the river.

At present, two procedures based on central nervous pharmacological manipulation have been shown to be effective in bringing core body temperature well below 30 °C in the rat, a non-hibernator: the first, based on the inhibition of a key relay in the central thermoregulatory pathway, the other, based on the activation of central adenosine A1 receptors. Although the role of mitochondria in the activation and maintenance of torpor has been extensively studied, no data are available for centrally induced hypothermia in non-hibernators. Thus, in the present work the respiration rate of mitochondria in the liver and in the kidney of rats following the aforementioned hypothermia-inducing treatments was studied. Moreover, to have an internal control, the same parameters were assessed in a well-consolidated model, i.e., mice during fasting-induced torpor. Our results show that state 3 respiration rate, which significantly decreased in the liver of mice, was unchanged in rats. An increase of state 4 respiration rate was observed in both species, although it was not statistically significant in rats under central adenosine stimulation. Also, a significant decrease of the respiratory control ratio was detected in both species. Finally, no effects were detected in kidney mitochondria in both species. Overall, in these hypothermic conditions liver mitochondria of rats remained active and apparently ready to be re-activated to produce energy and warm up the cells. These findings can be interpreted as encouraging in view of the finalization of a translational approach to humans."
128,Asymmetric effect of structural change and renewable energy consumption on carbon emissions: designing an SDG framework for Turkey,"Tomiwa Sunday Adebayo,Seun Damola Oladipupo,Husam Rjoub,Dervis Kirikkaleli,Ibrahim Adeshola,Tomiwa Sunday Adebayo,Seun Damola Oladipupo,Husam Rjoub,Dervis Kirikkaleli,Ibrahim Adeshola","A plethora of studies have shown that structural change helps nations achieve socioeconomic growth. The influence of structural change on environmental quality, on the other hand, has yet to be thoroughly investigated. As a result, the current study assesses the asymmetric impact of structural change on CO2 emissions while controlling for the effects of economic progress, renewable energy utilization, and nonrenewable energy in Turkey. To this end, this research used yearly data stretching from 1965 to 2019. The study applied several econometric approaches including nonlinear auto-regressive distributed lag (NARDL) and spectral causality to assess these associations. The outcomes from the NARDL reveal that variations in the regressors have a nonlinear influence on CO2 in Turkey. Moreover, the transition in the economy's structure helps to boost ecological quality, while the findings also show that Turkey's current economic progress trajectory is unsustainable due to the country's reliance on fossil fuel-based energy consumption. The outcomes of the spectral causality test also show that structural change can predict CO2 emissions in Turkey at different frequencies. Based on the study findings, the government should encourage investment in the service sector in order to maintain a suitable level of environmental sustainability."
129,Evaluating the impact of clean energy consumption and factor allocation on China's air pollution: A spatial econometric approach,"Li, Li; Hong, Xuefei; Wang, Jun","China's air pollution has become a widespread concern in the academic world, but there are few studies based on spatial measurement methods to quantify the impact of clean energy consumption and factor allocation on a variety of pollutants. Based on an exploratory spatial data analysis, a spatial Durbin model and extended Cobb-Douglas production function (C-D production function) are used to study the direct, indirect and total effects of clean energy consumption and element allocation on China's air pollution emissions. The exploratory spatial data analysis results showed that the three emissions had significant agglomeration effects, and the spatial aggregation patterns of the emissions were similar to the patterns of fossil energy consumption spatial aggregation. The spatial Durbin model estimation results showed that the clean energy consumption proportion and factor allocation of energy and labour inhibited air pollution emissions. The spatial spillover effect was greater than the direct effect. The fossil energy structure and factor allocation of energy and capital stock were positively related to air pollution emissions. These findings help to formulate regional industrial policies and energy policies and contribute to the governance of air pollution and the sustainable development of economic, environmental and energy resources.

Second-generational unit root test is used to address the issue of cross-sectional dependency. Mixed order of integration enabled us to use panel autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) method to investigate short-run and long-run association. Moreover, this study also employs Granger causality test to explore causalities among the selected variables. Empirical results reveal that FDI has a positive and statistically significant effect on environmental degradation. Institutional quality is measured as rule of law has insignificant impact on ecological footprint both in short run as well as long run. However, government stability decreases environmental degradation while corruption enhances environmental hazards tremendously. This study also supports environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) for the South Asian countries. This study emphasized the role of political institutions in environmental degradation. South Asian countries must focus on the implementation of environmental laws and regulations by improving the quality of institutions to achieve the goal of sustainable development."

However, this paper finds that this transformation is not complete. While catering to the national environmental protection governance requirements, some enterprises still persist the profit growth pattern of ""growth with pollution."" How to solve this problem? By attracting government subsidies, reducing tax burdens, and increasing the proportion of technical personnel employed, we theoretically and empirically demonstrate that the positive effect of ""new infrastructure"" in accelerating enterprises' transformation away from the profit growth pattern of ""growth with pollution"" to sustainable development. In the heterogeneity analysis section, we found that in enterprises with higher political correlation, more technical personnel, and lower labor cost, the ""new infrastructure"" has a stronger restraining effect on the ""growth with pollution"" pattern."

A.","A thermal, environmental, and economic behavior study was performed for social housing in Mexico. This research focuses on the comparison between a traditional roof (TR) and a green roof (GR) under the weather conditions of eight cities in Mexico. The study was carried out by means of thermal simulations using the EnergyPlus software, which were validated with experimental data from two test boxes (TR and GR). For the validation of the simulations, the interior surface temperature and the heat flow of the roof of the test boxes were measured, and a maximum error of 3.55% and 2.17% was found for the interior surface temperature for the traditional and green roof, respectively. The results of the simulation showed that in locations with warm weather the GR reduced the indoor temperature of the house up to 4.7 degrees C. In locations with temperate weather, the GR reduced the cooling energy demand by up to 99%, and at the same time increased the heating energy demand by 25%. From the environmental study, it was found that the GR also reduced the CO2 by 45.7%. In the economic part, the GR had a payback period of 8.8 years, which makes the implementation of the green roof viable. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

When prostate-specific antigens are present, the aptamer-modified PtNP@Co3O4 hollow nanopolyhedrals and magnetic beads form sandwich structures, which have excellent peroxidase-like activities, because of the synergetic effect of PtNP@Co3O4 hollow nanopolyhedrals. The sandwich structures can be separated from the mixture by the magnetic effect of the magnetic beads and catalyze the redox reactions between H2O2 and TMB, generating quantitative electrochemical and colorimetric responses in homogeneous solution simultaneously. Under the optimized conditions, the linear range of both electrochemical (0.01 to 10 ng/ml) and colorimetric (0.01-15 ng/ml) channels can satisfy the demand of prostate-specific antigen detection in clinic (4 ng/ml), and the electrochemical and colorimetric channels have a low detection limit of 0.0079 ng/ml and 0.01 ng/ml respectively without using natural enzymes. The strategy by using synergetic PtNP@Co3O4 hollow nanopolyhedrals as signal probes provides a promising scheme for developing simple, rapid, reliable, and ultrasensitive dual-channel homogeneous biosensors, which has a great potential as a powerful tool in prostate cancer diagnosis."

136,Economic benefits of fourth generation district heating,"Averfalk, Helge; Werner, Sven","The main impetus for lower distribution temperatures in district heating systems is the lower heat supply costs obtained by these lower temperatures. In this paper, the differences in heat supply costs for two different temperature levels have been estimated for various future heat supply options. The estimations were obtained by modelling a district heating system characterised by typical climate conditions for Central Europe. High sensitivity to lower supply costs from lower temperatures was found for geothermal heat, industrial excess heat, and heat pumps, whereas low cost sensitivity was estimated for combined heat and power plants using waste or biomass. Lower heat distribution loss constitutes a minor component of the total cost reductions. The current use of high heat distribution temperatures was identified as an important barrier for the transition to renewable and recycled heat supply in district heating systems. Hence, lower distribution temperatures would facilitate this required transition because lower distribution temperatures provide higher profitability for these renewable and recycled heat sources.

This study aims to conduct a control experiment on cool pavement bricks selection from the local market. The surface temperature difference and change characteristics of 28 bricks with different physical properties (i.e. colour, thickness, size and internal structure) were recorded by an infrared thermal imager and thermometers. Comparative analysis shows that the maximum surface temperature of the light-yellow brick is 7.3 °C lower than that of the ash black one, and the maximum surface temperature of hollow bricks is 5.6 °C lower than that of solid bricks. Thick bricks have a slightly low mean and maximum surface temperatures, and large bricks also have a low maximum surface temperature, but only deep coloured bricks. The analysis of variance revealed that for the maximum surface temperature, the three factors (i.e. colour, thickness and internal structure) have an interactive effect; for the mean surface temperature, only the colour and internal structure factors have a significant independent effect. This paper provides a feasible bottom-up cooling scheme for urban underlying surface."

We examined the association between social support and HRQL in a sample of persons with fibromyalgia and tested the potential mediating role of self-compassion. Self-identified adults in the United States with fibromyalgia (N = 508) were recruited from state, regional, and national organizations and support groups and completed an online battery of self-report questionnaires including: Multidimensional Health Profile-Psychosocial Functioning Index, Short-Form 36 Health Survey, and Self-Compassion Scale-Short Form. Individuals with greater subjective social support reported higher levels of self-compassion and, in turn, higher mental HRQL. These findings provide greater information about psychosocial constructs and HRQL and extend our understanding of self-compassion among individuals living with fibromyalgia."
140,Protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor type Z1 inhibits the cisplatin resistance of ovarian cancer by regulating PI3K/AKT/mTOR signal pathway,"Peng Wang,Yuanjing Hu,Pengpeng Qu,Ying Zhao,Jing Liu,Jianguo Zhao,Beihua Kong,Peng Wang,Yuanjing Hu,Pengpeng Qu,Ying Zhao,Jing Liu,Jianguo Zhao,Beihua Kong","Most patients with ovarian cancer (OC) get remission after undergoing cytoreductive surgery and platinum-based standard chemotherapy, but more than 50% of patients with advanced OC relapse within the first 5 years after treatment and develop resistance to standard chemotherapy. The production of medicinal properties is the main reason for the poor prognosis and high mortality of OC patients. Cisplatin (DDP) resistance is a major cause for poor prognosis of OC patients. PTPRZ1 can regulate the growth and apoptosis of ovarian cancer cells, while the molecular mechanism remains unknown. This study was designed to investigate the roles of PTPRZ1 in DDP-resistant OC cells and possible mechanism. PTPRZ1 expression in OC tissues and normal tissues was analyzed by GEPIA database and verified by Real-time Quantitative Reverse Transcription PCR (RT-PCR) assay. PTPRZ1 expression in normal ovarian cancer cells and DDP-resistant OC cells was also analyzed. Subsequently, RT-PCR, Western blot, MTT experiment and flow cytometry were used to assess the effects of PTPRZ1-PI3K/AKT/mTOR regulating axis on DDP resistance of OC. PTPRZ1 expression was abnormally low in OC tissues, and notably reduced in DDP-resistant OC cells. MTT experiment and flow cytometer indicated that overexpression of PTPRZ1 enhanced the DDP sensitivity of OC cells and promoted the cell apoptosis. Moreover, the results of our research showed that PTPRZ1 might exert its biological effects through blocking PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway. PTPRZ1 overexpression inhibitied OC tumor growth and resistance to DDP in vivo. Overall, PTPRZ1 might suppress the DDP resistance of OC and induce the cytotoxicity by blocking PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway."
141,"Impact of irrigation and fertilization regimes on greenhouse gas emissions from soil of mulching cultivated maize (Zea mays L.) field in the upper reaches of Yellow River, China","Li, Changjian; Xiong, Yunwu; Huang, Quanzhong; Xu, Xu; Huang, Guanhua","Greenhouse gas emissions from agricultural soil are strongly affected by the field practices including fertilization, irrigation and cultivation model. Understanding the mechanism of greenhouse gas emissions from soil and their impact factors is essential for cleaner agricultural production and global greenhouse gas mitigation. This paper investigated greenhouse gas emissions from soil of mulching cultivated maize (Zea mays L.) field under different irrigation and fertilization regimes. Border and drip irrigation with different schedules were implemented in the upper reaches of Yellow River, China. Border irrigation included three different irrigation depths (180, 315 and 450 mm), and drip irrigation was controlled by a tensiometer and triggered by three different matric potentials (similar to 15, similar to 25 and similar to 35 kPa). Three nitrogen fertilizer levels (350, 250 and 150 kg ha(-1)) were applied for the drip irrigation triggered by the matric potential of -25 kPa. Soil acted as a sink of CH4 in the semiarid site regardless of irrigation and nitrogen fertilization regimes. Irrigation scheduling had no significant influence on CO2 emissions, but the irrigation method did have. Cumulative CO2 emissions increased by 24.7% for drip irrigation compared with border irrigation at the same water and nitrogen fertilizer levels. Cumulative CO2 emissions for the high nitrogen fertilizer treatment (350 kg ha(-1)) increased by 19.3% in comparison with the medium and low levels under drip irrigation. N2O emissions were positively related to the irrigation depth under both drip and border irrigation. Cumulative N2O emissions reduced by 23.5% for drip irrigation compared with border irrigation at the same water and nitrogen fertilizer levels. N2O emissions increased with the increase in nitrogen fertilizer application under drip irrigation. Drip irrigation with high frequency (- 15 kPa) and medium nitrogen fertilization (250 kg ha(-1)) obtained the best economic and environmental performance through comprehensive evaluation of the yield, water and fertilizer productivity, global warming potential, greenhouse gas intensity and net ecosystem economic budget. The findings can provide an opportunity for greenhouse gas mitigation without crop yield reduction following the proper irrigation and fertilization regimes in the semiarid region.

142,New challenges of food security in Northwest China: Water footprint and virtual water perspective,"Liu, Xian; Shi, Lijie; Engel, Bernie A.; Sun, Shikun; Zhao, Xining; Wu, Pute; Wang, Yubao","In this study, the water footprint (blue, green and grey WF) and virtual water theory were used to uniform measure the new challenges (population growth, population urbanization, dietary structure change, energy industry development, grain trade and climate change) of food security in Northwest China. Moreover, this study quantified the demand for new challenges to water resources from 2000 to 2016, and then evaluated their impact on water resources and food security in Northwest China. The results showed that in 2000-2016, population growth caused the food consumption WF to increase from 153.8 Gm ( )to 159.6 Gm(3), with an average annual growth rate of 0.4%. The ratio of per capita consumption of WF of urban residents to rural areas has increased from 80.3% to 120%. The per capita food consumption in the region increased by 1.3% annually due to changes in dietary structure. However, with the increase of water use efficiency, the WF decreased by 0.3% per year. Among them, the total consumption WF of food rations decreased by 51.9%, with an average annual decrease of 4.4%, and that of meat, dairy products and aquatic products increased by 2.4%, 10.8% and 3.0% per year, respectively. From the economic point of view, the development of the energy industry has increased the competition index of energy-grain to water resources from 0.22 to 0.49. Due to climate change, although the precipitation increased at a rate of 3.2 mm/yr, the increase in ET 0 was 3.3 mm/yr, and thus the demand for water resources in agricultural production increased. Based on the results, this paper suggests to carry out measures such as optimizes crop planting structure, adopts effective biological, agricultural technologies, guides healthy food consumption structure, strengthens international food trade and biofuel use and so on to reduce the WF of grain crops and energy industry. Ultimately, the goal of reducing regional water stress and ensuring food security is achieved. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."
143,Techno-economic analysis of grid-integrated PV/wind systems for electricity reliability enhancement in Ethiopian industrial park,"Azerefegn, Tefera Mekonnen; Bhandari, Ramchandra; Ramayya, A. Venkata","In most developing countries, the electricity supply system is highly unreliable. Ethiopia is one of the least developed country in the world, and the existing distribution system of the country has encountered frequent power interruptions. During this interruption, diesel generator supplied the critical load of most industries in the country. This paper examines the feasibility of integrating PV/wind power systems into existing unreliable grid/diesel generator systems for supplying the critical loads of industrial parks in three different regions of Ethiopia. The study focused on how to provide a reliable supply with cost-effective and environment-friendly resources. Based on load variation, grid interruption, and meteorological data of the study areas, modeling and techno-economic analysis of grid-connected PV/wind/diesel systems were carried out using HOMER Pro software by exploring four different scenarios involving the consideration of unscheduled outages. Results showed that grid//diesel/PV/battery systems are technically, economically, and environmentally feasible for all three climate regions with the cost of energy at 0.044, 0.049, and 0.048 $/kWh, respectively. Also found that excess electricity, cost of energy, and the net present cost is slightly increased with PV penetration, whereas the CO2 emissions for these locations decreased by 45%, 44%, and 42% compared to the existing systems."
144,Analyzing the environmental Kuznets curve hypothesis: The role of disaggregated transport infrastructure investments,"Erdogan, Sinan","The provision of affordable and sustainable transport systems is a crucial issue for both the establishment of sustainable cities and the development of society. It is a significant part of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). In this paper, we aimed to unveil interactions between infrastructure investments in transport systems and environmental degradation in 21 Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries. The empirical findings can be summed up as follows: (a) there is a long-run relationship between variables; (b) gross domestic product (GDP) per capita has a positive and statistically significant coefficient, while GDP per capita square has a negative statistically significant coefficient, and therefore, the environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) hypothesis is valid (c) additionally, rail infrastructure investment has a negative and statistically significant parameter sign, whereas road and air infrastructure investments have a positive and statistically significant parameter sign; and (d) trade openness has a positive and statistically significant coefficient. Hence, rail investment helps achieve the establishment of sustainable transport systems and low-environmental pollution targets of SDGs, whereas road and air investments hamper their establishment."

We provide the historical context in which IE was developed, and explain the principles and terminology in IE for the novice researcher. Through the use of worked examples, the reader will be able to appreciate how IE can be used to approach research questions in the healthcare system that other methods would be unable to answer. We show how IE and qualitative research methods maintain quality and rigour in research findings. We hope to demonstrate to healthcare professionals and researchers that healthcare systems can be analysed as social organisations, and IE may be used to identify and understand how higher-level processes and policies affect day-to-day clinical work. This understanding may allow the formulation and implementation of actionable improvements to solve problems on the ground."
146,Impact of income inequality on CO2 emissions in G20 countries,"Chen, Jiandong; Xian, Qin; Zhou, Jixian; Li, Ding","Over the past three decades, the G20 countries have experienced rapid economic growth but also a widening income disparity and deteriorating environment. We examined whether and how income distribution affects CO2 emissions during economic growth under the extended EKC framework. Using simultaneous quantile regression analysis, we show that, for developing countries, a more equal income distribution favors reductions to the CO2 emissions per capita, whereas, in most developed countries, income inequality hardly affects CO2 emissions. Meanwhile, the EKC hypothesis is valid in G20. Based on the empirical results, we particularly emphasize the importance of reducing income inequality in developing countries and that the entire G20 takes the path of sustainable development."
147,The analysis and probabilistic health risk assessment of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in cereal products,"Fariba Khalili,Nabi Shariatifar,Mohammad Hadi Dehghani,Kamyar Yaghmaeian,Ramin Nabizadeh Nodehi,Mehdi Yaseri,Majid Arabameri,Fariba Khalili,Nabi Shariatifar,Mohammad Hadi Dehghani,Kamyar Yaghmaeian,Ramin Nabizadeh Nodehi,Mehdi Yaseri,Majid Arabameri","The analysis and probabilistic health risk assessment of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in cereal products were done by using magnetic solid-phase extraction (MSPE) method and gas chromatography/mass spectrometric (GC/MS). The results of method showed LOQ and LOD of PAHs compounds were 0.105-0.180 and 0.035-0.060 µg/kg, and the recorded values were 4.3-12.1 and 6.1-20.3% for repeatability and reproducibility with an estimated recovery of 94.4-103.4%. In this study, we analyzed kind of bread (Barbari, Sangak, Baguette, Taftoon, Lavash), macaroni, lasagna, and cooked rice that mean of total PAHs were 98.2, 121.7, 134.9, 166.3, 176.3, 176.2, 130.1, and 248.3 μg/kg, respectively. Further, the correlation between the type and amount of 16 PAHs with cereal products samples evaluated with multivariate principal component analysis and heat map visualization. The highest incremental lifetime cancer risk (ILCR) was found in cooked rice (7.80E-6), while the lowest ILCR was found in Lasagna (2.35E-07). In conclusion, the PAHs content in the tested products were in low health risk ranges (1 × 10-6 < ILCR < 1 × 10-4), and all of the cereal products sold in Tehran are considered safe for consumers. Therefore, cereal products should be regularly evaluated and monitored by regulatory agencies to reduce contaminants in these high-consumption products."
148,Impact of Trade Openness and Human Capital on Economic Growth: A Comparative Investigation of Asian Countries,"Intisar, Rabail Amna; Yaseen, Muhammad Rizwan; Kousar, Rakhshanda; Usman, Muhammad; Makhdum, Muhammad Sohail Amjad","The aim of this study is to analyze the impact of trade openness and human capital on economic growth in 19 Asian countries from 1985 to 2017. We selected two geographically distributed regions (Western and Southern Asia) based on difference in their GDP per capita. We applied the unit root tests to examine the level of stationarity and found that all variables were integrated at first difference. Kao and Fisher cointegration tests were employed and the results revealed the presence of a long-run relationship. We applied fully modified ordinary least square (FMOLS) and dynamic ordinary least square (DOLS) models to check the magnitude of the long-run coefficients among trade openness, human capital and economic growth. To investigate the direction of causality, we used a Dumitrescu and Hurlin (DH) causality test. The results indicated that trade openness and human capital have a significant and positive relationship while labor force participation has a negative effect on economic growth in Southern Asia, and in the case of Western Asia, the impact is positive. Foreign direct investment (FDI) has a negative and significant impact on GDP per capita (GDPPC) in Western Asia while it is positive and significant in Southern Asia; Total population (TPOP) has a negative impact on GDPPC in both regions. Furthermore, human capital has a positive and significant impact on trade openness in both panels. Meanwhile, labor force participation (LFP) has a positive and significant impact on trade openness in Southern Asia and a negative impact in the case of Western Asia. Trade openness and economic growth have bidirectional causality in Western Asia and unidirectional causality in Southern Asia. It also shows that human capital and economic growth have unidirectional causality in both regions."
149,Environmental sustainable value in agriculture revisited: How does Common Agricultural Policy contribute to eco-efficiency?,"Czyzewski, Bazyli; Matuszczak, Anna; Grzelak, Aleksander; Guth, Marta; Majchrzak, Adam","The conflict between capital-intensive agriculture, often called industrial agriculture, and sustainable farming is ongoing, and not because of Western European countries, where intensification is increasingly sustainable. It is caused by several million small farms in Central and Eastern Europe that must choose a long-term development path. This is also a dilemma for agricultural policy: Are small farms so environmentally friendly that they should play the role of 'landscape guardians' at the expense of public support and economic vegetation, or should they strive to improve productivity through investments? This study offers a methodological contribution to the value-based sustainability approach by computing indicators of environmental sustainable value (ESV). The authors have attempted to combine the value-oriented approach with frontier benchmarking. They then tested how the European Union Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) schemes contribute to ESV using a long-term panel of regionally representative farms from Farm Accountancy Data Network (FADN) with regard to factor endowments, for the years 2004-2017. The seminal within-between specification was employed to control the time variant and time invariant space heterogeneity of European regions. The main finding is that higher investment support is beneficial to ESV. Regarding factor endowment influence, there was a positive impact of the capital-labour ratio. Except the cross-sectional impact of environmental subsidies, the payments exert a negative effect on ESV."
150,How is COVID-19 affecting environmental pollution in US cities? Evidence from asymmetric Fourier causality test,"Pata, Ugur Korkut","This paper aims to examine the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on PM(2.5)emissions in eight selected US cities with populations of more than 1 million. To this end, the study employs an asymmetric Fourier causality test for the period of January 15, 2020 to May 4, 2020. The outcomes indicate that positive shocks in COVID-19 deaths cause negative shocks in PM(2.5)emissions for New York, San Diego, and San Jose. Moreover, in terms of cases, positive shocks in COVID-19 cause negative shocks in PM(2.5)emissions for Los Angeles, Chicago, Phoenix, Philadelphia, San Antonio, and San Jose. Overall, the findings of the study highlight that the pandemic reduces environmental pressure in the largest cities of the USA. This implies that one of the rare positive effects of the virus is to reduce air pollution. Therefore, for a better environment, US citizens should review the impact of current production and consumption activities on anthropogenic environmental problems."
151,"Causal interactions between trade openness, renewable electricity consumption, and economic growth in Asia-Pacific countries: Fresh evidence from a bootstrap ARDL approach","Ghazouani, Tarek; Boukhatem, Jamel; Sam, Chung Yan","This paper applies a new bootstrap Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) approach to examine the nexus between trade openness, renewable electricity consumption, and economic growth for seven countries in the Asia-Pacific region during 1980-2017 period. In fact, there is no evidence of cointegration among real trade openness, electricity consumption, and real GDP per capita in countries, with the exception of Malaysia, where real GDP serves as dependent variable. However, cointegration does manifest in the cases of Indonesia, Japan, South Korea, and Thailand when trade openness is used as the dependent variable. A similar outcome is observed for Indonesia, Malaysia, and Thailand when renewable electricity consumption is used as the dependent variable. A short-run analysis reveals mixed results in term of the direction of the causality among different variables for various countries. Such results have implications for trade, energy, and environmental policies. One implication is that any environmental policy aiming to reduce the use of non-renewable energy and carbon dioxide emissions will inevitably lead to greater renewable energy consumption, which in turn may enhance trade openness and ultimately accelerate economic growth."
152,Use of waste marble dust and recycled glass for sustainable concrete production,"Bostanci, Sevket Can","Commitments on reducing embodied CO2 emissions and declining available natural resources puts pressure on the concrete sector to produce more sustainable approaches. Waste materials are widely being used in concrete production. Feasibility and practicality of waste materials on concrete properties are mainly associated with fresh and hardened properties. The use of waste materials can be feasible only under the condition of successful satisfaction of environmental and economic sustainability. In this respect, this research aimed to investigate fresh and hardened properties of equal 28 d design strength (45 MPa) concretes made with natural aggregates and 5% and 10% marble dust as a replacement of Portland cement and Portland cement mix containing 20% recycled glass sand as a replacement to natural sand. Then, a further detailed investigation was carried out to assess the environmental and economic sustainability of laboratory mixes. The results showed that the use of waste materials provided similar fresh properties as control mix. The 28 d compressive cube strength decreased by 10%-19% for recycled glass sand and marble dust added mixes. Studies assessing other engineering properties, including sound permeability, thermal conductivity and water permeability showed enhanced performances for waste incorporated mixes. Regarding sustainability performance, marble dust and recycled glass sand mixes had a lower environmental footprint and higher cost compared to conventional concrete. Considering overall performance analysis, marble dust and recycled glass sand showed 17% and 8% improvement, respectively, revealing a promising solution for sustainable concrete production.

We are currently living in a pandemic phase, and corruption is even more damaging during these times of crisis that the world is experiencing with COVID-19. Vaccination is the only survival option that we have. The development of a nation will soon be measured by the criteria of who owns more vaccines. This study has four objectives. The first is to explore the most recent relevant literature. Moreover, we also investigate the unique trilogy of corruption, the environment, and the COVID-19 pandemic. The second is to identify adequate channels for distributing the COVID-19 vaccines. The vaccines should be dispersed based on the categories of age, gender, ethnicity, profession, and health conditions. Third, we explored the factors that are causing corruption in the distribution of the COVID-19 vaccines. Our findings show that unequal distribution, theft and black markets, weaponization of vaccines, logistical challenges, and substandard and falsified vaccines are the factors that potentially lead to corruption. The fourth objective is to investigate solutions for mitigating corruption. We revealed that blockchain, awareness, well-planned distribution channels, and prioritization of vulnerable groups are the steps that could effectively reduce corruption."
154,Medical abortion in primary care,"Deborah Bateson,Kathleen McNamee,Caroline Harvey,Deborah Bateson,Kathleen McNamee,Caroline Harvey","Early medical abortion is a safe, cost effective and acceptable alternative to surgical abortion. It offers privacy and autonomy and can be provided by general practitioners who have completed an online training module. Abortion can be induced with mifepristone and misoprostol up to nine weeks of gestation. Apart from anticoagulation and severe anaemia, there are few contraindications and precautions for medical abortion. Obtaining informed consent requires the provision of information on expected effects, adverse effects and complications. The woman must know when to present to an emergency department. Follow-up must be arranged to ensure the abortion is complete. A serum human chorionic gonadotropin concentration or a low-sensitivity urine pregnancy test is used to confirm completion. Most contraceptive methods can be started immediately following medical abortion. If an intrauterine device is preferred, it should be inserted after confirming the abortion is complete."
155,Are smart cities more ecologically efficient? Evidence from China,"Yao, Tingting; Huang, Zelin; Zhao, Wei","As a new mode of urbanization, smart city both influences the environmental load and economic performance of cities through technology effect, resource allocation effect and industrial structure upgrade effect. So comes the natural question: has smart city construction improved the eco-efficiency of cities In China? How does the impact change over time? Is the impact heterogeneous across cities? Based on Green Solow model, this paper adopts the Super-efficiency SBM model to measure the eco-efficiency of 152 prefecture-level cities in China covering the period 2003-2016, and then DID model is applied to investigate the impact of smart city pilot policy on eco-efficiency. On the whole, the smart city construction significantly improves the eco-efficiency, and the multi-stage DID results reveal that the promotion effect is increasing over time due to the annual superposition. Furthermore, the impact is heterogeneous across cities. Although the promotion effect on medium-sized cities is less than that of large cities, the promotion effect has actually weakened when the urban population size exceeds 5 million. Moreover, the lower the level of city's economic development, the greater the role of smart city construction in promoting eco-efficiency. The research conclusion is of great practical significance for the reform of urban governance model and the realization of high-quality urban development."
156,Desmoglein-3 induces YAP phosphorylation and inactivation during collective migration of oral carcinoma cells,"Usama Sharif Ahmad,Eric Kenneth Parkinson,Hong Wan,Usama Sharif Ahmad,Eric Kenneth Parkinson,Hong Wan","Alterations of the Hippo-YAP pathway are potential targets for oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) therapy, but heterogeneity in this pathway could be responsible for therapeutic resistance. We analysed the Hippo-YAP signatures in a cohort of characterised keratinocyte cell lines derived from the mouth floor and buccal mucosa from different stages of OSCC tumour progression and focused on the specific role of YAP on invasive and metastatic potential. We confirmed heterogeneity in the Hippo-YAP pathway in OSCC lines, including overexpression of YAP1, WWTR1 (often referred to as TAZ) and the major Hippo signalling components, as well as the variations in the genes encoding the intercellular anchoring junctional proteins, which could potentially regulate the Hippo pathway. Specifically, desmoglein-3 (DSG3) exhibited a unique and mutually exclusive regulation of YAP via YAP phosphorylation during the collective migration of OSCC cells. Mechanistically, such regulation was associated with inhibition of phosphorylation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) (S695/Y1086) and its downstream effectors heat shock protein beta-1 (Hsp27) (S78/S82) and transcription factor AP-1 (c-Jun) (S63), leading to YAP phosphorylation coupled with its cytoplasmic translocation and inactivation. Additionally, OSCC lines displayed distinct phenotypes of YAP dependency or a mixed YAP and TAZ dependency for cell migration and present distinct patterns in YAP abundance and activity, with the latter being associated with YAP nuclear localisation. In conclusion, this study provides evidence for a newly identified paradigm in the Hippo-YAP pathway and suggests a new regulation mechanism involved in the control of collective migration in OSCC cells."
157,Green Brand of Companies and Greenwashing under Sustainable Development Goals,"Pimonenko, Tetyana; Bilan, Yuriy; Horak, Jakub; Starchenko, Liudmyla; Gajda, Waldemar","Implementing Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and increasing environmental issues provokes changes in consumers' and stakeholders' behavior. Thus, stakeholders try to invest in green companies and projects; consumers prefer to buy eco-friendly products instead of traditional ones; and consumers and investors refuse to deal with unfair green companies. In this case, the companies should quickly adapt their strategy corresponding to the new trend of transformation from overconsumption to green consumption. This process leads to increasing the frequency of using greenwashing as an unfair marketing instrument to promote the company's green achievements. Such companies' behavior leads to a decrease in trust in the company's green brand from the green investors. Thus, the aim of the study is to check the impact of greenwashing on companies' green brand. For that purpose, the partial least-squares structural equation modeling (PLS-PM), content analysis and Fishbourne methods were used. The dataset for analysis was obtained from the companies' websites and financial and non-financial reports. The objects of analysis were Ukrainian large industrial companies, which work not only in the local market but also in the international one. The findings proved that a one point increase in greenwashing leads to a 0.56 point decline in the company's green brand with a load factor of 0.78. The most significant variable (loading factor 0.34) influencing greenwashing was the information at official websites masking the company's real economic goals. Thus, a recommendation for companies is to eliminate greenwashing through the publishing of detailed official reports of the companies' green policy and achievements."
158,The complex web of canonical and non-canonical Hedgehog signaling,"Tara Akhshi,Rachel Shannon,William S Trimble,Tara Akhshi,Rachel Shannon,William S Trimble","Hedgehog (Hh) signaling is a widely studied signaling pathway because of its critical roles during development and in cell homeostasis. Vertebrate canonical and non-canonical Hh signaling are typically assumed to be distinct and occur in different cellular compartments. While research has primarily focused on the canonical form of Hh signaling and its dependency on primary cilia - microtubule-based signaling hubs - an extensive list of crucial functions mediated by non-canonical Hh signaling has emerged. Moreover, amounting evidence indicates that canonical and non-canonical modes of Hh signaling are interlinked, and that they can overlap spatially, and in many cases interact functionally. Here, we discuss some of the many cellular effects of non-canonical signaling and discuss new evidence indicating inter-relationships with canonical signaling. We discuss how Smoothened (Smo), a key component of the Hh pathway, might coordinate such diverse downstream effects. Collectively, pursuit of questions such as those proposed here will aid in elucidating the full extent of Smo function in development and advance its use as a target for cancer therapeutics."
159,Struvite pyrolysate cycling technology assisted by thermal hydrolysis pretreatment to recover ammonium nitrogen from composting leachate,"Zhang, Tao; Wu, Xiaosha; Li, Huanhuan; Tsang, Daniel C. W.; Li, Guoxue; Ren, Hongqiang","Composting leachate containing high concentrations of nitrogen imposes a significant burden on aquatic environment. Struvite crystallization to recover ammonium nitrogen from composting leachate is limited by the inefficient capture of organic nitrogen and excessive magnesium and phosphate input. To cope with these challenges, struvite pyrolysate cycling technology coupled with a thermal hydrolysis pretreatment was investigated to recover ammonium nitrogen from composting leachate. Struvite and its pyrolysate were characterized by SEM-EDX, FTIR, and particle size analyzer. The optimal conversion rate of nitrogen in composting leachate with thermal hydrolysis-assisted was obtained at 180 degrees C for 75 min, achieving an NH4+-N to total nitrogen proportion of 82.2%. The optimal parameters for struvite pyrolysate generation were found to be: molar ratio of hydroxyl to NH4+-N of 1:1, heating temperature of 110 degrees C, and holding time of 3 h. SEM-EDX analysis revealed that the principal struvite pyrolysate was MgNa-PO4 center dot 7H(2)O. When the struvite pyrolysate was reprocessed as novel magnesium and phosphate sources, the removal efficiency of NH4+-N decreased from 98.3 +/- 1.3% in the first cycle to 78.1 +/- 1.0% in the fifth cycle. FTIR analysis indicated the increase in the impurities content of struvite pyrolysate and the decrease in active phosphorus and magnesium sources. Particle size analysis suggested ammonium precipitation was restricted by the crystal growth size. An economic analysis demonstrated that 59.0% of processing costs could be saved by cycling struvite pyrolysate compared with a non-cycling process. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."

CDKN2A variants of uncertain significance (VUSs) are reported in up to 4.3% of patients with PDAC and result in significant uncertainty for patients and their family members as an unknown fraction are functionally deleterious, and therefore, likely pathogenic. Functional characterization of CDKN2A VUSs is needed to reclassify variants and inform clinical management. Twenty-nine germline CDKN2A VUSs previously reported in patients with PDAC or in ClinVar were evaluated using a validated in vitro cell proliferation assay. Twelve of the 29 CDKN2A VUSs were functionally deleterious (11 VUSs) or potentially functionally deleterious (1 VUS) and were reclassified as likely pathogenic variants. Thus, over 40% of CDKN2A VUSs identified in patients with PDAC are functionally deleterious and likely pathogenic. When incorporating VUSs found to be functionally deleterious, and reclassified as likely pathogenic, the prevalence of pathogenic/likely pathogenic CDKN2A in patients with PDAC reported in the published literature is increased to up to 4.1% of patients, depending on family history. Therefore, CDKN2A VUSs may play a significant, unappreciated role in risk of pancreatic cancer. These findings have significant implications for the counselling and care of patients and their relatives."
161,Satisfaction of Basic Psychological Needs and Adherence to Responsible Gambling Practices: The Mediating Role of Flourishing,"Kwok Kit Tong,Anise M S Wu,Juliet Honglei Chen,Kwok Kit Tong,Anise M S Wu,Juliet Honglei Chen","Responsible gambling (RG) is a practical approach to contain potential gambling-associated harms to an acceptable level. However, few studies have proposed a theoretical framework to account for significant individual differences in RG adherence, which hinders an effective RG promotion in public. To address this missing link, the current study aims to identify psychological need factors associated with adherence to RG practices. We applied the self-determination theory (SDT) to explore the association between the satisfaction of basic psychological needs (i.e., relatedness, competency, and autonomy) and RG adherence in a probability Chinese community adult sample (N = 1002; 55.7% women and M age = 44.28 years), acquired from a telephone survey conducted in the 2018 fall with a two-stage cluster random sampling method. We found that the three types of basic needs satisfaction were significantly and positively related to RG adherence via a full mediation of flourishing. The findings provide practical insights to understanding individual differences in RG adherence and designing corresponding SDT-based interventions for gambling communities globally."
162,Reliability and validity of the polish version of the vulnerability to Abuse Screening Scale (VASS),"Karolina Filipska,Monika Biercewicz,Adam Wiśniewski,Kornelia Kędziora-Kornatowska,Robert Ślusarz,Karolina Filipska,Monika Biercewicz,Adam Wiśniewski,Kornelia Kędziora-Kornatowska,Robert Ślusarz","Our aim was to assess the psychometric properties and reliability of a Polish version of the VASS. This cross-sectional validation study involved 228 patients above 65 years of age. Authors-Designed Questionnaire, the Geriatric Depression Scale, and the Activities of Daily Living Scale were used to assess construct validity. Psychometric properties, reliability and repeatability were assessed. Cronbach's alpha coefficient for the VASS scale was 0.89. Almost all items showed a high correlation value in relation to the others (R > 0.45). A high coefficient of repeatability and narrow limits of agreement were observed in the Bland-Altman analysis. All items analyzed had excellent intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC>0.9) and weighted kappa (κ > 0.9) scores. Very strong, significant correlations with other tools confirm the accuracy of the VASS scale. Our research shows promising validity and reliability Polish version of the VASS scale to assess the risk of elder abuse and neglect."
163,Numerical analysis of photovoltaic solar panel cooling by a flat plate closed-loop pulsating heat pipe,"Alizadeh, Hossein; Nazari, Mohammad Alhuyi; Ghasempour, Roghayeh; Shafii, Mohammad Behshad; Akbarzadeh, Aliakbar","Photovoltaic (PV) panels provide a suitable way for the direct conversion of solar energy into electricity. The electrical output and efficiency of PV modules are dependent on working temperature. The present study contributes to investigate the efficiency of utilizing a flat plate closed-loop pulsating heat pipe (CLPHP) to cool down a PV panel in both thermal and economic aspects. Accordingly, a numerical investigation is employed to obtain the surface temperature and electrical gain of the PV panel through four scenarios, including natural cooling without additional equipment, CLPHP-based passive cooling, CLPHP-based active cooling, and a conventional flat plate cooling methods. The efficiency of the cooling approaches is investigated in three different solar radiations and ambient temperatures according to the climatic condition of the considered location, Kerman, Iran. The improvement rate function is established to elaborate on the electrical gain efficiency of each scenario. Furthermore, each scenario is economically compared in terms of the payback period of the different cooling approaches. It is concluded that applying CLPHP-based passive, and active cooling approaches increase the improvement rate by 23% and 35% at the solar radiation of 1235 W/m(2), respectively. In addition, the results demonstrated that while the 4th scenario, conventional approach, induces higher improvement rate, it requires more operational cost, so increases the payback period by about 10% compared to the 3rd scenario. Accordingly, it is concluded that utilizing CLPHP for cooling the PV panel is an appropriate and cost-effective approach to increase the efficiency of the PV panel."
164,Quantitative structure-activity relationship(QSAR) models for color and COD removal for some dyes subjected to electrochemical oxidation,"Katha S Hirpara,Upendra D Patel,Katha S Hirpara,Upendra D Patel","Electrochemical oxidation is an efficient method for the destruction of dyes in wastewater streams. The experimental conditions during electrochemical oxidation (EO) and molecular structure of a dye greatly influence the extent of degradation. The extent of degradation for a variety of dyes by EO can be predicted conveniently by the use of Quantitative structure-activity Relationship (QSAR) models. An abundant amount of published data on dye degradation by EO using highly variable experimental conditions lies unutilized to prepare QSAR models. In this study, an effort is made to use published experimental data on EO of aqueous dyes after applying an easy method of normalization, to prepare QSAR models for percent color and COD removal. Normalized color and COD removal were obtained by multiplying the reported removal by volume of reactor and concentration of dye; and divided by total current passed and the time of electrolysis. More than 15 molecular descriptors were computed using Schrodinger-suit 2018-3. The multiple linear regression (MLR) approach was used to develop normalized color and COD removal models. The quantum chemical descriptors: highest occupied molecular orbital energy (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital energy (LUMO), polar surface area (PSA), hydrogen bond donor count (HBD), and number of atoms were found significant. The statistical indices: goodness-of-fit, R2 > 0.75, and internal and external validations, Q2LOOCV and Q2ext, > 0.5, satisfied the criteria for predictive models and indicated that the method of normalization used in this study is adequate. Developed QSAR models are quite simple, interpretable, and transparent."
165,Techno-economic assessment of biomass gasification-based mini-grids for productive energy applications: The case of rural India,"Chambon, Clementine L.; Karia, Tanuj; Sandwell, Philip; Hallett, Jason P.","As the costs of solar PV continuously decrease and pollution legislation imposes less burning of agricultural residues, decentralized renewable energy is increasingly affordable for providing electricity to one billion people lacking access to a power grid. This paper presents a techno-economic feasibility case study of biomass gasification in off-grid and grid-connected mini-grids for community-scale energy application in rural Uttar Pradesh, India. Energy demand data was collected through surveys in a village with irrigation and agro-processing loads and off-grid households and used to construct a seasonal load profile based on statistical methods. This was used to simulate single-source and hybrid mini-grids based on solar PV, biomass gasification and diesel generation using HOMER Pro. Hybrid PV-biomass or PV-diesel systems were found to offer the highest reliability for off-grid power at the lowest cost. Single-source PV was cheaper than biomass gasification, though the cost of electricity is highly sensitive to biomass supply and gasifier maintenance. Both renewable options were around half the cost of diesel generation. The findings held across grid-connected systems with weak, moderate and strong reliability of grid supply. This suggests that biomass gasification-based mini-grids are not cost-competitive with PV unless the two generation sources are combined in a hybrid system, though they require operational testing prior to implementation.

166,Linking biomass energy and CO2 emissions in China using dynamic Autoregressive-Distributed Lag simulations,"Danish; Ulucak, Recep","Can biomass energy mitigate CO2 emissions in China? Given increasing environmental pollution and global warming, countries are switching to alternate energy sources that might help pollution reduction and mitigate climate change. In this scenario, biomass energy has received the attention of academic scholars and policy analyst alike. What role biomass energy can play in environmental pollution remains uncertain, so further investigation is necessary. To this end, this study explores the relationships of biomass energy and real income with CO2 emissions for China. Empirical evidence is based on the use of Jordan and Philips' (2018) econometric tool, dynamic Autoregressive-Distributed Lag (DARDL) simulations, on data from 1982 to 2017. The results reveal a negative relationship between China's biomass energy consumption and CO2 emissions, suggesting that biomass energy consumption is helpful in reducing pollution. Likewise, biomass energy production reduces carbon emissions and might be the best alternative to fossil fuels. Useful policy implications can be drawn related to biomass energy, especially in attaining sustainable development goals. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."
167,Economic and environmental life cycle assessment of organic waste treatment by means of incineration and biogasi fication. Is source segregation of biowaste justi fied in Germany?,"Mayer, Felix; Bhandari, Ramchandra; Gaeth, Stefan A.; Himanshu, Himanshu; Stobernack, Niklas","In the realm of the German scope, four different waste treatment options for the Organic Fraction of Municipal Solid Waste (OFMSW) were evaluated against the environmental and economic background: (i) anaerobic digestion followed by composting, (ii) incineration of OFMSW, (iii) incineration of separately pre-dried OFMSW and (iv) a cascaded treatment system, which couples anaerobic digestion with incineration (i.e. incineration of digestate). Environmental life cycle assessment (eLCA) and a calculation of the levelized costs of exergy (LCOE) were performed to map the sustainability aspects of the different product systems. Within a hybrid approach, consisting of literature data evaluation, theoretical modelling, the conduct of lab-scaled experiments and a substrate analysis, a comprehensive assessment was compiled. Within the eLCA, the main drivers of the total environmental impact were the categories global warming potential (GWP) and the fossil depletion potential (FDP). (i) Anaerobic digestion followed by composting and (ii) incineration were hereby characterized by the fewest environmental impacts. With regards to the base case, the GWP was calculated to similar to 500 g CO2-Eq/kWh exergy for these options. The FDP was <0.05 kg oil-Eq/kWh exergy for anaerobic digestion and -0.075 kg oil-Eq/kWh exergy for incineration. The other examined treatment options were characterized by a significantly higher GWP and FDP. The economic assessment showed median LCOE of 27 ct/kWh exergy for anaerobic digestion followed by composting and thus outcompeted incineration (median: 55 ct/kWh Exergy). Separate pre-drying prior to incineration increased the economic burdens marginally. Anaerobic digestion followed by incineration showed the highest economic expenses (89 ct/kWh exergy). In conclusion, anaerobic digestion followed by composting was marked by an overall preferential environmental and economic constellation and source segregation is thereof justified and should further be maintained.

We encountered a case of multiple LCNECs in the rectum and the descending colon. A 66-year-old man presented with anal pain. Colonoscopy showed an ulcerated infiltrating tumor in the rectum, and 0.5 cm of erosion in the descending colon. A biopsy revealed LCNEC in both regions. Abdominal computed tomography revealed irregularly enhanced wall thickening at the rectum and hepatic metastases. Due to the diagnosis of LCNEC, laparoscopic abdominoperineal resection of the rectum was performed. Histopathological examination showed a poorly differentiated, LCNEC in both regions. Immunohistochemical examination demonstrated that the tumor cells were positive for chromogranin and synaptophysin. LCNEC was confirmed, and systemic chemotherapy with cisplatin/irinotecan was initiated. To our knowledge, this is the first case report that describes multiple LCNECs in the rectum and descending colon."
169,Acid-base effects of combined renal deletion of NBCe1-A and NBCe1-B,"Hyun-Wook Lee,Jill W Verlander,Gary E Shull,Autumn N Harris,I David Weiner,Hyun-Wook Lee,Jill W Verlander,Gary E Shull,Autumn N Harris,I David Weiner","The molecular mechanisms regulating ammonia metabolism are fundamental to acid-base homeostasis. Deletion of the A splice variant of Na+-bicarbonate cotransporter, electrogenic, isoform 1 (NBCe1-A) partially blocks the effect of acidosis to increase urinary ammonia excretion, and this appears to involve the dysregulated expression of ammoniagenic enzymes in the proximal tubule (PT) in the cortex but not in the outer medulla (OM). A second NBCe1 splice variant, NBCe1-B, is present throughout the PT, including the OM, where NBCe1-A is not present. The purpose of the present study was to determine the effect of combined renal deletion of NBCe1-A and NBCe1-B on systemic and PT ammonia metabolism. We generated NBCe1-A/B deletion using Cre-loxP techniques and used Cre-negative mice as controls. As renal NBCe1-A and NBCe1-B expression is limited to the PT, Cre-positive mice had PT NBCe1-A/B deletion [PT-NBCe1-A/B knockout (KO)]. Although on a basal diet, PT-NBCe1-A/B KO mice had severe metabolic acidosis, yet urinary ammonia excretion was not changed significantly. PT-NBCe1-A/B KO decreased the expression of phosphate-dependent glutaminase and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase and increased the expression of glutamine synthetase, an ammonia-recycling enzyme, in PTs in both the cortex and OM. Exogenous acid loading increased ammonia excretion in control mice, but PT-NBCe1-A/B KO prevented any increase. PT-NBCe1-A/B KO significantly blunted acid loading-induced changes in phosphate-dependent glutaminase, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, and glutamine synthetase expression in PTs in both the cortex and OM. We conclude that NBCe1-B, at least in the presence of NBCe1-A deletion, contributes to PT ammonia metabolism in the OM and thereby to systemic acid-base regulation.NEW & NOTEWORTHY The results of the present study show that combined deletion of both A and B splice variants of electrogenic Na+-bicarbonate cotransporter 1 from the proximal tubule impairs acid-base homeostasis and completely blocks changes in ammonia excretion in response to acidosis, indicating that both proteins are critical to acid-base homeostasis."
170,"Role of Inflammatory Niche and Adult Cardiomyocyte Coculture on Differentiation, Matrix Synthesis, and Secretome Release by Human Bone Marrow Mesenchymal Stem Cells","Jyotsna Joshi,Chandrasekhar R Kothapalli,Jyotsna Joshi,Chandrasekhar R Kothapalli","Myocardial infarction (MI) causes cardiomyocyte death, provokes innate immune response, and initiates tissue remodeling. The intrinsic healing process is insufficient to replace the lost cells, or regenerate and restore the functional features of the native myocardium. Autologous bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cell (BM-MSC) transplantation is being explored to offer therapeutic potential after MI. Here, we cultured human BM-MSC spheroids in three-dimensional collagenous gels for 28 days under exposure to tumor necrosis factor-alpha (+ TNFα), and coculture with adult human cardiomyocytes, or with conditioned media (CM) pooled from TNFα-stimulated adult cardiomyocytes. MSC differentiation marker (CD90, GATA4, cTnI, cTnT, Cx43, MHC, α-actin) expression, matrix protein (elastin, hyaluonic acid, sulfated glycosaminoglycans, laminin, fibrillin, nitric oxide synthase) synthesis, and secretome (cytokines, chemokines, growth factors) release at days 12 and 28 were assessed. MSC density decreased with duration in all culture conditions, except in controls. GATA4 expression was higher in cocultures but lower in + TNFα cultures. Synthesis and deposition of various extracellular matrix proteins and lysyl oxidase within MSC cultures, as well as secretome composition, were strongly dependent on the culture condition and duration. Results suggest that TNFα-induced inflammation suppresses BM-MSC survival and differentiation into mature cardiomyocytes by day 28, while promoting matrix protein synthesis and cytokine release conducive to MI remodeling. These findings could have implications in developing tissue engienering and cell transplantation strategies targeting MI, as well as to develop therapuetics to target inflammation-induced matrix remodeling post-MI."

In animals without comorbidities, Angipur administered intravenously was 1.2 times less effective, in terms of ED50, than the well-known inhibitor of GPIIb/IIIa platelet receptors tirofiban. However, under conditions of non-coronary myocardial infarction, Angipur significantly prolonged the time of thrombus formation and exhibited 1.4-fold higher activity than the reference drug tirofiban."
172,"Drought Risk to Agricultural Systems in Zimbabwe: A Spatial Analysis of Hazard, Exposure, and Vulnerability","Frischen, Janna; Meza, Isabel; Rupp, Daniel; Wietler, Katharina; Hagenlocher, Michael","The devastating impacts of drought are fast becoming a global concern. Zimbabwe is among the countries more severely affected, where drought impacts have led to water shortages, declining yields, and periods of food insecurity, accompanied by economic downturns. In particular, the country's agricultural sector, mostly comprised of smallholder rainfed systems, is at great risk of drought. In this study, a multimethod approach is applied, including a remote sensing-based analysis of vegetation health data from 1989-2019 to assess the drought hazard, as well as a spatial analysis combined with expert consultations to determine drought vulnerability and exposure of agricultural systems. The results show that droughts frequently occur with changing patterns across Zimbabwe. Every district has been affected by drought during the past thirty years, with varying levels of severity and frequency. Severe drought episodes have been observed in 1991-1992, 1994-1995, 2002-2003, 2015-2016, and 2018-2019. Drought vulnerability and exposure vary substantially in the country, with the south-western provinces of Matabeleland North and South showing particularly high levels. Assessments of high-risk areas, combined with an analysis of the drivers of risk, set the path towards tailor-made adaptation strategies that consider drought frequency and severity, exposure, and vulnerability."
173,"Urban Digital Twins for Smart Cities and Citizens: The Case Study of Herrenberg, Germany","Dembski, Fabian; Woessner, Uwe; Letzgus, Mike; Ruddat, Michael; Yamu, Claudia","Cities are complex systems connected to economic, ecological, and demographic conditions and change. They are also characterized by diverging perceptions and interests of citizens and stakeholders. Thus, in the arena of urban planning, we are in need of approaches that are able to cope not only with urban complexity but also allow for participatory and collaborative processes to empower citizens. This to create democratic cities. Connected to the field of smart cities and citizens, we present in this paper, the prototype of an urban digital twin for the 30,000-people town of Herrenberg in Germany. Urban digital twins are sophisticated data models allowing for collaborative processes. The herein presented prototype comprises (1) a 3D model of the built environment, (2) a street network model using the theory and method of space syntax, (3) an urban mobility simulation, (4) a wind flow simulation, and (5) a number of empirical quantitative and qualitative data using volunteered geographic information (VGI). In addition, the urban digital twin was implemented in a visualization platform for virtual reality and was presented to the general public during diverse public participatory processes, as well as in the framework of the ""Morgenstadt Werkstatt"" (Tomorrow's Cities Workshop). The results of a survey indicated that this method and technology could significantly aid in participatory and collaborative processes. Further understanding of how urban digital twins support urban planners, urban designers, and the general public as a collaboration and communication tool and for decision support allows us to be more intentional when creating smart cities and sustainable cities with the help of digital twins. We conclude the paper with a discussion of the presented results and further research directions."

175,Elaboration of geopolymers based on clays by-products from phosphate mines for construction applications,"Mabroum, S.; Aboulayt, A.; Taha, Y.; Benzaazoua, M.; Semlal, N.; Hakkou, R.","Yellow clays from Moroccan phosphate mines are extracted with other waste rocks lithologies and stored in large dumps within the mine site. The present paper investigates the use of this by-product as a new aluminosilicate source for geopolymers elaboration at the laboratory scale. Yellow clays studied are mainly composed of montmorillonite, dolomite and quartz as major phases. The Toxicity Characteristic Leaching Procedure (TCLP) showed no existence of contaminant. In order to reach thermal activation, the raw clays were first calcined at different temperatures between 500 and 900 degrees C. Raw and calcined clays were characterized using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) and Fourier transformed infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. For the synthesis of geopolymers, calcined powder was mixed with an alkaline solution presenting different NaOH/Na2SiO3 ratios. The compressive strength was measured at 7, 14 and 28 days and material porosity was determined using Mercury Intrusion Porosimetry method in order to explain the mechanical behavior. XRD, 27Al and 29Si Magic Angle Spinning Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (MAS-NMR) spectroscopy, Fourier transformed infrared and TGA have been used to investigate the gel structure. The thermal treatment at 900 degrees C allowed the destruction of crystalline structure of montmorillonite clays, as well as the formation of new phases such as periclase (MgO) and gehlenite (Ca2Al2SiO7). Furthermore, the Al-27 - Si-29 MAS-NMR and the XRD analysis of the elaborated materials confirmed the formation of two cementitious gels C-A-S-H (Calcium aluminum silicate hydrate) and N-A-S-H (Sodium aluminum silicate hydrate). The compressive strength was around 25 MPa at 28 days. The obtained results are promising; they have shown that elaborated materials can be adapted for construction applications. In this case, it is recommended that economic and commercial study be developed. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."

177,"Pollution, economic growth, and COVID-19 deaths in India: a machine learning evidence","Mele, Marco; Magazzino, Cosimo","This study uses two different approaches to explore the relationship between pollution emissions, economic growth, and COVID-19 deaths in India. Using a time series approach and annual data for the years from 1980 to 2018, stationarity and Toda-Yamamoto causality tests were performed. The results highlight unidirectional causality between economic growth and pollution. Then, a D2C algorithm on proportion-based causality is applied, implementing the Oryx 2.0.8 protocol in Apache. The underlying hypothesis is that a predetermined pollution concentration, caused by economic growth, could foster COVID-19 by making the respiratory system more susceptible to infection. We use data (from January 29 to May 18, 2020) on confirmed deaths (total and daily) and air pollution concentration levels for 25 major Indian cities. We verify a ML causal link between PM2.5, CO2, NO2, and COVID-19 deaths. The implications require careful policy design."

The fish is emerging as an important model animal in sexual development, in addition to economic and pharmaceutical implications. Tracing genomic history that shapes speciation of the fish has led to discovery of the whole genome-wide chromosome fission/fusion events. Natural intersex differentiation is a compelling feature for sexual development research. Notably, identification of progenitors of germline stem cells that have bipotential to differentiate into either male or female germline stem cells provides new insight into sex reversal. Here, we review these advances that have propelled the field forwards and present unsolved issues that will guide future investigations to finally elucidate vertebrate sexual development using the new model."
179,Circular economy strategies for adaptive reuse of cultural heritage buildings to reduce environmental impacts,"Foster, Gillian","Circular economy strategies seek to reduce the total resources extracted from the environment and reduce the wastes that human activities generate in pursuit of human wellbeing. Circular Economy concepts are well suited to the building and construction sector in cities. For example, refurbishing and adaptively reusing underutilized or abandoned buildings can revitalize neighborhoods whilst achieving environmental benefits. Cultural heritage buildings hold a unique niche in the urban landscape. In addition to shelter, they embody the local cultural and historic characteristics that define communities. Therefore, extending their useful lifespan has multiple benefits that extend beyond the project itself to the surrounding area, contributing to economic and social development. To explore this complex issue, the research applies systematic literature review and synthesis methods. Decision makers lack knowledge of the environmental benefits of adaptive reuse of cultural heritage buildings and lack tools to implement these projects. A new comprehensive circular economy framework for the adaptive reuse of cultural heritage buildings to reduce environmental impacts intends to meet these needs. The framework integrates methods and techniques from the building and construction literature that aim to reduce lifecycle environmental impact of buildings with a circular product supply chain approach."

As reported here, a platform based on Nicotiana benthamiana produced mAb therapeutics with high batch-to-batch reproducibility and flexibility, enabling production of 19 different mAbs of sufficient purity and safety for clinical application(s). With a single manufacturing run, impurities were effectively removed for a representative mAb product (the ZMapp component c4G7). Our results show for the first time the reproducibility of the platform for production of multiple batches of clinical-grade mAb, manufactured under current Good Manufacturing Practices, from Nicotiana benthamiana. The flexibility of the system was confirmed by the results of release testing of 19 different mAbs generated with the platform. The process from plant infection to product can be completed within 10 days. Therefore, with a constant supply of plants, response to the outbreak of an infectious disease could be initiated within a matter of weeks. Thus, these data demonstrated that this platform represents a reproducible, flexible system for rapid production of mAb therapeutics to support clinical development."
181,The application of ecological footprint and biocapacity for environmental carrying capacity assessment: A new approach for European cities,"Swiader, Malgorzata; Lin, David; Szewranski, Szymon; Kazak, Jan K.; Iha, Katsunori; van Hoof, Joost; Belcakova, Ingrid; Altiok, Selen","Contemporary socio-environmental problems such as the reduced availability of natural resources, the loss of biodiversity, soil degradation, pollution, an unprecedented population growth, the mass migration of people to cities, and urban sprawl may be associated with the consequences of an economic infinite growth paradigm on a finite planet. Despite international goals for improving the spatial and environmental management, current and future developments are continuously planned without the consideration of the biophysical limits to growth. This could be equated with the environmental carrying capacity (ECC), a concept and a tool for the sustainable development of human settlements. This research use the environmental indicators such as Ecological Footprint (EF) and biocapacity (BC) for ECC quantification. Despite EF and BC accounting is well-developed at the global, national and regional levels, there is still lack of local - urban standard for EF assessment. Therefore, the main goal of this study is to present the local approach for EF assessment and its potential to use for ECC assessment at local (i.e., city) level. The study compares the hybrid EF, which joined the bottom-up CF with the remaining EF's components from a top-down approach, with the standard top-down EF approach. In this study, the assessment focused mainly on household consumption which could be equated as main driver responsible for Ecological Footprint. Thus, the impact of household consumption was quantified according to four categories reflecting resources' use and waste generation as: Food, Housing, Mobility, Services and Goods. The analysis of ECC was conducted for the Polish city of Wroclaw in Central Eastern Europe for the year 2016. The results showed, that the city of Wroclaw exceeds its ECC. Both calculations were affected by data limitations, and likely represent overestimation of the EF. The proposed approach could be important for ECC assessment, quantification of the EF of human activities, and more sustainable spatial management of the city."

Nevertheless, the economic viability of lignocellulosic ethanol is also dependent of an efficient utilization of the hemicellulosic fraction, which contains xylose as a major component in concentrations that can reach up to 40% of the total biomass in hardwoods and agricultural residues. This major bottleneck is mainly due to the necessity of chemical/enzymatic treatments to hydrolyze hemicellulose into fermentable sugars and to the fact that xylose is not readily consumed bySaccharomyces cerevisiae-the most used organism for large-scale ethanol production. In this work, industrialS. cerevisiaestrains, presenting robust traits such as thermotolerance and improved resistance to inhibitors, were evaluated as hosts for the cell-surface display of hemicellulolytic enzymes and optimized xylose assimilation, aiming at the development of whole-cell biocatalysts for consolidated bioprocessing of corn cob-derived hemicellulose. Results These modifications allowed the direct production of ethanol from non-detoxified hemicellulosic liquor obtained by hydrothermal pretreatment of corn cob, reaching an ethanol titer of 11.1 g/L corresponding to a yield of 0.328 g/g of potential xylose and glucose, without the need for external hydrolytic catalysts. Also, consolidated bioprocessing of pretreated corn cob was found to be more efficient for hemicellulosic ethanol production than simultaneous saccharification and fermentation with addition of commercial hemicellulases. Conclusions These results show the potential of industrialS. cerevisiaestrains for the design of whole-cell biocatalysts and paves the way for the development of more efficient consolidated bioprocesses for lignocellulosic biomass valorization, further decreasing environmental and economic costs."

These tumours have been reported to undergo rapid growth during gestation and regression post-partum, implicating a role for female sex hormones in tumour physiology. In addition, these tumours occur at a higher incidence in the skull base compared to sporadic meningiomas in the general population, often impinging neurovascular structures and requiring emergent resection. While the genomics of sporadic meningiomas have been described, there are no reports characterizing the genetic features of those associated with pregnancy. Here we describe a patient diagnosed with a diphragma sellae meningioma early in the third trimester after presenting with rapidly deteriorating vision. At 32 weeks gestation the baby was delivered by caesarean section and the tumour subsequently removed. Genomic profiling of the tumour sample revealed variants of unknown significant (VUS) in six genes, none of which were in canonical meningioma drivers. We describe our surgical approach and discuss the relevant pathology and genomics, as well as medical and surgical management considerations of meningiomas in pregnancy."
184,A photoelicitation exploration on formally homeless people experience with Universal Credit: System error and 'the government don't care',"Bruno B De Oliveira,Bruno B De Oliveira","This article explores the impact of Universal Credit (UC) on a group of formerly homeless people who were forcibly made to experience a system of full of errors and government that, in their view, did not care. The experience of a marginalised and vulnerable group with complex needs allows one to consider the impacts of welfare reforms on vulnerable people. The research was conducted with formerly homeless contacted via organisations that support people who experienced homelessness in Brighton, Southeast of the UK. Five people (32 years and older) participated. Qualitative data were obtained in photo-elicitation interviews and were thematically analysed. Findings were that they faced a system of error as well as experiencing a sense the government did not care about their situation. The participants expressed their views on how the UC process made them 'struggle' and caused them to have to 'use food banks', and argued that the staff did not know the policy. The system is singled out as the cause of UC claimants' destitution. For the participants, policymakers' negligence, contempt, and detachment were not hard to understand. The article provides implications for practice and research."
185,Effects of technological innovation on energy efficiency in China: Evidence from dynamic panel of 284 cities,"Wang, Huiping; Wang, Meixia","Technological innovation and energy efficiency are important indicators used to measure the success of the sustainable development strategy in China. This paper aims to explore the total factor energy efficiency (TFEE) at the city level in China and to evaluate the impact of technological innovation on TFEE. Therefore, a two-stage analysis was conducted for the period from 2001 to 2013. The first stage includes an estimation of TFEE scores using the Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) methodology and Malmquist-Luenberger index, while the second stage includes an exploration of the impact of technological innovation on the TFEE scores obtained in the first stage using a system Generalised Method of Moment (GMM) regression analysis. Based on the results of the Malmquist-DEA, the TFEE of cities in China shows an upward trend overall, but obvious differences in the TFEE are observed among the four regions, with the highest TFEE observed in the eastern region, the second highest TFEE in the central region, a lower TFEE in the northeastern region and the lowest TFEE in the western region. The system GMM regression results reveal a significant positive impact of technological innovation on TFEE at the national level. According to the regional characteristics, the technological innovation in the eastern, western and northeastern regions is particularly important for improving TFEE, but technological innovation in the central region has inhibited the improvement of the TFEE. A logical response to these findings would be to develop different policies for different regions. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."
186,An assessment of environmental sustainability corridor: The role of economic expansion and research and development in EU countries,"Adedoyin, Festus Fatai; Alola, Andrew Adewale; Bekun, Festus Victor","Given that the European Union-28 countries proposed a target of 3% of the Gross Domestic Product on research and development (R&D) expenditure by 2020, the current study attempts to examine the role of R&D on environmental sustainability. In addition, the study further investigates the long-run and causal interaction between, renewable energy consumption, nonrenewable energy consumption, and economic growth in an ecological footprint-income function. Notably, the study incorporates research and development (R&D) expenditure to the model as an additional variable, and measures impact of each variable on ecological footprint. Empirical evidence is based on a balanced panel data between annual periods of 1997-2014 for selected EU-16 countries. The Pedroni, Johansen Multivariate and Kao tests all reveal a cointegration between ecological footprint, economic growth, research and development expenditure, renewable, and nonrenewable energy consumption. The Fully Modified and Dynamic Ordinary Least Squares models (FMOLS and DOLS) both suggest a negative significant relationship between the countries' research and development expenditure and ecological footprint in the long-run. This implies that spending on R&D significantly impacts on environmental sustainability of the panel countries. Our study affirms that nonrenewable energy consumption and economic growth increase carbon emission flaring while renewable energy consumption declines ecological footprint. The panel causality analysis reveals a feedback mechanism between ecological footprint. R&D expenditure, renewable, and nonrenewable energy consumption. We further observed a one-way causality between ecological footprint and economic growth. The current further validates that the Environmental Kuznet Curve Hypothesis (EKC) holds for this panel of EU countries examined. Effective policy implications could be drawn toward modern and environmentally friendly energy sources, especially in attaining the Sustainable Development Goals via spending on R&D.

187,Global prevalence of cardiopulmonary resuscitation training among the general public: a scoping review,"Alexei Birkun,Adhish Gautam,Fatima Trunkwala,Alexei Birkun,Adhish Gautam,Fatima Trunkwala","A scoping review was conducted to identify, map, and analyze international evidence from studies investigating the prevalence of community cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) training. We searched major bibliographic databases and grey literature for original studies evaluating the prevalence of CPR training in the general population. Studies published from January 2000 to October 2020 were included without language or publication type restrictions. Seventy-three eligible papers reported a total of 61 population-based surveys conducted in 29 countries. More than three-fourths of the surveys were conducted in countries with high-income economies, and none in low-income countries. Over half of the surveys were at a subnational level. Globally, the proportion of laypeople trained in CPR varied greatly (median, 40%). For high-income countries, the median percentage was twice as high as that of upper middle-income countries (50% vs. 23%). The studies used heterogeneous survey methods and reporting patterns. Key methodological aspects were frequently not described. In summary, few studies have assessed CPR training prevalence among the general public. The rates of resuscitation training for the vast majority of countries remain unknown. High heterogeneity of studies precludes a reliable interpretation of the research. International Utstein-style consensus guidelines are needed to inform future research and reporting of public resuscitation training worldwide."
188,The impact of diet on wastewater treatment works phosphorus loading,"Chloe Down,Sean Comber,Chloe Down,Sean Comber","Phosphorus (P) is a building block for life in which the human body requires 0.55 g of per day. In some cases, this requirement is exceeded by 2 g per day, with P additives contributing to half of this exceedance. The use of P has become prominent as demand for processed convenience foods has increased. P can cause significant eutrophication once discharged to the environment. As of October 2019, 55% of assessed rivers and 73% of assessed lakes in England failed the current water quality standards. A survey was conducted to calculate the average P consumption of individuals who identify as meat eaters, flexitarians, vegetarians and vegans based on stated eating habits and reported P levels in foods, revealing an estimated P consumption of 1715, 1664, 1244, 1125 mg P/day respectively. It was estimated that current diets contribute 45% of the P load to UK wastewater treatment works (WwTW). If the UK population were to all convert to veganism this would decrease by 54% reducing the load to WwTW by over 15,000 tonnes of P per year, or 9000 tonnes of P per year if there was a move towards a 50% vegetarian or vegan population. Finally, the population needs to be better informed on what is in their food and the associated environmental impacts."
189,Using different multivariate approaches to assess water quality of qanats in arid zones of Southern Central Mexico,"Jacinto Elías Sedeño-Díaz,Eugenia López-López,A Joseph Rodríguez-Romero,Karla Fierro Leos,Melissa Tiburcio Martínez,Oscar Emiliano Escobar Sánchez,Jacinto Elías Sedeño-Díaz,Eugenia López-López,A Joseph Rodríguez-Romero,Karla Fierro Leos,Melissa Tiburcio Martínez,Oscar Emiliano Escobar Sánchez","Qanats in the aquifer of the Tehuacán Valley (Mexico) represent an ancient way of using groundwater that is still practiced today. They are used mainly for agricultural irrigation. However, anthropogenic activities have jeopardized the use of these aquifers. We analyzed 24 qanats in the Tehuacán Valley to assess water quality. Based on 24 physicochemical variables, a water quality index (WQI) was constructed on a zero-to-100 scale, divided into five water quality classes. A decision-tree analysis was applied to identify the parameters with the highest influence on the WQI, considering the water quality classes as categorical responses and the values of physicochemical variables as drivers of these categories. We produced interpolation maps to identify trends. The relationship between the WQI and the normalized difference indices of vegetation and salinity (NDVI and NDSI, respectively) was analyzed using a ternary diagram. WQI scores showed that 12.5% of the qanats have very good quality; 25%, good quality; and the remaining (62.5%) range from moderate to unacceptable quality. The CHAID classification-tree method correctly explained 83.3% of the categories, with sulfates, alkalinity, conductivity, and nitrates as the main parameters that explain water quality. WQI was inversely related to NDVI and NDSI, showing seasonal differences. Interpolation maps suggest a better water quality in the northern zone of the aquifer."
190,Assessing alternative crop establishment methods with a sustainability lens in rice production systems of Eastern India,"Devkota, Krishna Prasad; Sudhir-Yadav; Khanda, C. M.; Beebout, Sarah J.; Mohapatra, Bidhan K.; Singleton, Grant R.; Puskur, Ranjitha","Sustainability of rice production systems is a prime concern for Asia to maintain food security and to support economic growth. This gain in productivity not only depends on agricultural inputs but also depends on social and environmental factors. To address these emerging issues, new resource- and capital-efficient and profitable technologies have been introduced. The conventional method of rice production (puddling and manual transplanting, PTR) is considered as highly input intensive. As an alternative, dry direct seeded rice (DSR) using seed drill has been promoted to save labor and production costs compared with PTR. Similarly, machine transplanted rice (MTR) has been also considered and promoted in many rice growing countries of South and East Asia. Economic, environmental, and social performances of DSR and MTR (alternative rice establishment technologies) were compared to the PTR using Sustainable Rice Platform (SRP) defined 12 Performance Indicators (PIs) (version 1.0) as a gauge to measure their sustainability. For that, a household survey was conducted on 652 households in Odisha India during 2016. The gaps, i.e., the target to achieve better sustainability, were computed for most of the indicators from the difference between top 10th percentile and the population mean value of the indicator. The results indicated a yield gap of 1.35 t ha(-1) , a profit gap of $273 ha(-1), labor productivity gap of 21 kg day(-1), nitrogen (N) use efficiency gap of 22 kg grain kg(-1) N, phosphorus (P) use efficiency gap of 105 kg grain kg(-1) P, and water productivity gap of 0.00010 kg grain L-1 water in rice production systems in Odisha. Among the compared technologies, MTR results in the highest yield, profit, labor productivity, nitrogen-, phosphorus-use efficiency, and water productivity (at par), and is positive for children's welfare and the overall energy productivity, indicating better sustainability and has the potential to replace PTR. Direct seeded rice has the highest yield gap (1.57 t ha(-1); 38%) but has the lowest production cost (can reduce the cost of production by $130 ha(-1)), and the highest greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction potential. SRP PIs are capable for assessing the sustainability of rice establishment technologies except for a few indicators, for example food safety and workers health and safety, which are more applicable to watershed and household level indicators, respectively. The SRP PIs provide scientific evidence and practical impetus for the selection and promotion of sustainable rice production technologies. (C) 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd."

However, the taxonomic status of the three subspecies of the Chinese pangolin has not been well resolved, which impedes regional conservation and illegal trade traces. In this study, the complete mitogenome sequence of M.p.pentadactyla, an endemic subspecies of the Chinese pangolin in Taiwan, was determined. The complete mitogenome of M.p.pentadactyla is 16,570 base pairs (bp) in length with 13 protein-coding genes (PCG), 23 transfer RNAs (tRNAs), two ribosomal RNAs and a 1164 bp control region. The overall base composition of the genome showed a slight A + T bias (59.9%), positive AT skew (0.1515) and negative GC skew (-0.3406), which is similar to that of other pangolins. All PCGs started with a typical ATN codon and all tRNAs were typical cloverleaf-shaped secondary structures, except for tRNA-Ser(GCU). Phylogenetic analysis indicated a monophyletic relationship for M.p.pentadactyla and M.p.aurita and was monophyletic for M.p.pentadactyla, but paraphyletic for M.p.aurita. The paraphyly of M.p.aurita resulted from an incomplete lineage sorting. This study enriched the mitogenome database of the Chinese pangolin and the molecular information obtained should be very useful for future research on mitogenome evolution and genetic diversification in M.pentadactyla."
193,Personal willingness to receive a Covid-19 vaccine and its relationship with intergroup psychology: Evidence from the Philippines and Pakistan,"Hanna Zagefka,Erwine Dela Paz,Ma Elizabeth J Macapagal,Saima Ghazal,Hanna Zagefka,Erwine Dela Paz,Ma Elizabeth J Macapagal,Saima Ghazal","High levels of vaccine hesitancy are an obstacle to the successful management of the Covid-19 pandemic. In this research, we identify psychological correlates of reluctance to personally receive a Covid-19 vaccine, with a focus on intergroup relations. Insights are based on two survey studies conducted in traditionally underresearched settings, the Philippines (N = 289) and Pakistan (N = 275). Results show that trust in vaccines, concerning both the vaccine's efficacy and the vaccine's safety, was associated with willingness to use the vaccine. Perceptions of trust were related to intergroup psychology, such that vaccine donations from political opponents rather than allies were trusted less. This meant that in the Philippines, there was a preference to use vaccines from the United States over those from China, although the pattern was less clear in Pakistan. Having said this, the highest levels of trust and willingness to use vaccines in both countries were for vaccines offered by the World Health Organization (WHO). Last but not least, a perception of global common fate of all humans in the face of the pandemic was positively associated with willingness to get vaccinated, even when controlling for concerns about the vaccine's efficacy and safety. Implications are discussed in relation to intergroup psychology and public health management."

Cities have different characteristics in MSW components, generation quantity, influencing factors and disposal ways. Beijing, Guangzhou and Lhasa of Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei economic circle, Pearl River Delta economic zone, and Qinghai-Tibet plateau regions were selected as representative cities, to compare and analyze the features, influencing factors to the MSW generation quantities, and its components by grey correlation analysis. Predictions of MSW generation quantities for Beijing, Guangzhou and Lhasa in 2025 would be 1251.22, 704.71 and 71.040 million tons, respectively, made by BP (back propagation) nerve work using MATLAB software. Results showed that the main indicators of influencing factors to MSW in three cities were all of economic development levels, population and investments of government input. Based on the analysis of internal relationship and characteristics of MSW, some barriers of MSW management were analyzed, and recommendations were given. Our study analyzed the influencing factors and forecasted quantities of MSW generation in representative cities in China, providing valuable evidences for the severe MSW disposal situation of different economic zones in China.

The empirical exercise was conducted using Pesaran Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) bounds testing approach. To accomplish our study objective, we analyze stationarity properties of the series using the unit root test after which we applied Bayer-Hanck (B-H) combined technique to cointegration to assess whether a long-run relationship exists among the series. Empirical results show that a 1% change in FDI account for 0.002% and 0.013% increase in economic expansion in the short- and long- run respectively. Also, a 1% increase in coal consumption influence GDP negatively by 0.083% and 0.207% in the short and long run respectively. Furthermore, a 1% increase in total natural resource rent positively affects GDP by 0.02% and 0.05% respectively in the short and long run. Industrialization, on the other hand, demonstrates a positive and significant impact on the economic growth process both in the short and long run. Industrialization contributes 0.506% and 1.274% to economic expansion both in the short and long run respectively. The causality tests suggest that a one-way causal link running from FDI to industrialization and from industrialization to coal consumption exists. Finally, FDI inflow drives total natural resource rents in South Africa. This study also gives reliable growth and energy policy proposals to policymakers applicable to countries around the globe."
196,The potential for integration of hydrogen for complete energy self-sufficiency in residential buildings with photovoltaic and battery storage systems,"Lokar, Jan; Virtic, Peter","This paper presents an analysis of energy production in a pilot building located in Slovenia, which is a typical residential house with an installed photovoltaic (PV) system and pilot battery storage system. Energy management system gathers data from smart meters every 15 min. As the pilot building location is in central Europe, complete energy self-sufficiency cannot be provided. The most problematic period of energy production with photovoltaic systems is winter. Solar radiation during the winter is much lower than in the summer and sometimes snow covers photovoltaic panels and disables energy production. Energy production and energy consumption are analyzed for one year. This study shows that complete self-sufficiency can be achieved by supplementing photovoltaic systems with hydrogen fuel cells. The amount of hydrogen, which would suffice for complete self-sufficiency for the whole period, is calculated according to the analyzed data. A synergy between photovoltaic system and hydrogen fuel cells is a step forward to complete self-sufficiency with renewable energy sources. The share of self-sufficiency of a hybrid PV fuel cell system would be 62.13%, meaning that there is no possibility for complete self-sufficiency from the pilot system. The shortage of hydrogen is 144.24 kg for one year and for achieving complete energy self-sufficiency, PV system should be bigger. A hybrid system with photovoltaic system, battery storage system and hydrogen fuel cells can be a solution for complete self-sufficiency. From an economic point of view, such systems are accessible for commercial use. The initial investment is relatively high, because of the high cost of the hydrogen storage tank.

A deeper understanding of the complex stromal biology of the TME will identify new avenues to establish treatment strategies for PDAC patients. Herein, we sought to clarify whether stromal remodeling by NAC affects recurrence patterns and prognosis in BR PDAC patients. We retrospectively analyzed data from 104 BR PDAC patients who underwent pancreatectomy with or without NAC (upfront surgery [UpS], n = 44; gemcitabine + nab-paclitaxel [GnP], n = 28; and gemcitabine + S-1 [GS], n = 32) to assess the correlations of treatment with early recurrence, the stromal ratio, and Ki-67 levels. Eighty-six patients experienced recurrence, and those with liver metastasis had significantly shorter recurrence-free survival than those with other recurrence patterns. The frequency of liver metastasis was significantly higher in patients with a low stromal ratio than in those with a high stromal ratio in the NAC group but not in the UpS group. Patients in the GnP group had significantly higher Ki-67 than those in the GS and UpS groups. A low stromal ratio was positively correlated with high Ki-67 in the NAC group but not in the UpS group. The low stromal ratio induced by NAC promoted early liver metastasis in patients with BR PDAC. Our findings provide new insights into the complexity of stromal biology, leading to consideration of the optimal NAC regimen."
198,The influence of multiple environmental regulations on haze pollution: Evidence from China,"Zhang, Ming; Liu, Xiaoxiao; Sun, Xinran; Wang, Wenwen","Air quality in China has deteriorated continuously within the last ten years, the Chinese central government has developed numerous environmental regulations (ERs) to improve the air condition. This paper adopts three different standards to measure the ERs for studying the impacts of ERs on haze pollution. According to previous studies, the mechanism of environmental regulations on air quality of this paper are developed and empirically analyzed by system GMM (Generalized Method of Moments) method using provincial panel data from 2006 to 2016 from China. Our empirical results conclude that (i) command-controlled regulations (ER1) and economic-incentive regulations (ER2) have nonlinear relationships with haze pollution, but the linear regression results of voluntary-consciousness environmental regulation (ER3) are not statistical significant; (ii) the effectiveness of the ERs is varied at different significance levels and most coefficients of western region are not statistical significant; (iii) the coefficients of foreign direct investment (FDI) are positive and statistical significant. However, FDI can also have a negative impact on haze pollution when ERs are fully carried out. The empirical analysis of the whole country is basically consistent with the ones of four different regions in China."
199,The impacts of different proxies for financialization on carbon emissions in top-ten emitter countries,"Amin, Azka; Dogan, Eyup; Khan, Zeeshan","The nexus of financialization and carbon emissions has been widely discussed in the literature. A vast body of literature that estimates the impact of financialization on carbon emissions proxies financialization with either domestic credit or market capitalization. However, these representatives do not fully respond to the complicated nature of financial development. To till the gaps in the existing literature, nine different proxies for financial development are used in the links with carbon emissions in the framework of EKC theory for the years 1980-2014. This study exposes reliable and robust empirical results due to the use of a number of proxies for financialization and second-generation econometric approaches in the empirical analysis. The quantile regression approach deals with unobserved heterogeneity for each cross-section and estimates different slope parameters at varying quantiles. Because non-normality and heterogeneity are detected in datasek quantile regression provides more robust and reliable estimates than conventional econometric techniques. Results from quantile regression estimator support mixed effects of financial development on carbon emissions over quantiles: in addition, the impact of financial development on carbon emissions is varying not only for each quantile but also for different proxies of financial development. The EKC hypothesis is validated for the top-ten emitter economies. Interpretations and policy suggestions are further discussed in the present study. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

Methods and Results To study the impact of routine transplacental fetal treatment, we reviewed 130 consecutive cases, including 108 with AVB III and 22 with other diagnoses (first-degree/second-degree atrioventricular block [n=10]; isolated endocardial fibroelastosis [n=9]; atrial bradycardia [n=3]). Dexamethasone was started at a median of 22.4 gestational weeks. Additional treatment for AVB III included the use of a β-agonist (n=47) and intravenous immune globulin (n=34). Fetal, neonatal, and 1-year survival rates with AVB III were 95%, 93%, and 89%, respectively. Variables present at diagnosis that were associated with perinatal death included an atrial rate <90 beats per minute (odds ratio [OR], 258.4; 95% CI, 11.5-5798.9; P<0.001), endocardial fibroelastosis (OR, 28.9; 95% CI, 1.6-521.7; P<0.001), fetal hydrops (OR, 25.5; 95% CI, 4.4-145.3; P<0.001), ventricular dysfunction (OR, 7.6; 95% CI, 1.5-39.4; P=0.03), and a ventricular rate <45 beats per minute (OR, 12.9; 95% CI, 1.75-95.8; P=0.034). At a median follow-up of 5.9 years, 85 of 100 neonatal survivors were paced, and 1 required a heart transplant for dilated cardiomyopathy. Cotreatment with intravenous immune globulin was used in 16 of 22 fetuses with diagnoses other than AVB III. Neonatal and 1-year survival rates of this cohort were 100% and 95%, respectively. At a median age of 3.1 years, 5 of 21 children were paced, and all had normal ventricular function. Conclusions Our findings reveal a low risk of perinatal mortality and postnatal cardiomyopathy in fetuses that received transplacental dexamethasone±other treatment from the time of a new diagnosis of immune-mediated heart disease."
201,Time-varying effect of oil price shocks on the stock market returns: Evidence from oil-importing and oil-exporting countries,"Mokni, Khaled","This paper performs a two-stage methodology based on the Structural VAR and time-varying parameter regression models to examine the dynamic reaction of a set of oil-related countries' stock markets to oil price shocks. Oil prices are studied by disentangling demand and supply shocks. Based on monthly data from the 1999-2018 period, the results report evidence of a time-varying reaction of all stock market returns to different oil shocks. Moreover, the stock returns react to the demand shocks more than to the supply shocks. Besides, the effect of supply shocks on stock returns is generally limited and negative, while the aggregate demand shocks exert a positive effect on almost all stock returns. Oil-specific demand shocks have positive effects on the oil-exporting stock returns and negative effects in the case of oil-importing countries, except for the Chinese market. These findings have important policy implications for policymakers and investors. (C) 2020 The Author. Published by Elsevier Ltd."
202,A current perspective for photocatalysis towards the hydrogen production from biomass-derived organic substances and water,"Huang, Chao-Wei; Ba-Son Nguyen; Wu, Jeffrey C-S; Van-Huy Nguyen","Recently, an increasing interest has been devoted to produce chemical energy - hydrogen (H-2) by converting sustainable sunlight energy via water splitting and reforming of renewable biomass-derived organic substances. These photocatalytic processes are very promising, sustainable, economic, and environment-friendly. Herein, this article gives a concise overview of photocatalysis to produce H-2 as solar fuel via two approaches: water splitting and reforming of biomass-derived organic substances. For the first approach - photocatalytic water splitting, there are two reaction types have been used, including photoelectrochemical (PEC) and photochemical (PC) cell reactions. For the second approach, biomass-derived oxygenated substrates could undergo selective photocatalytic reforming under renewable solar irradiation. Significant efforts to date have been made for photocatalysts design at the molecular level that can efficiently utilize solar energy and optimize the reaction conditions, including light irradiation, type of sacrificial reagents. Critical challenges, prospects, and the requirement to give more attention to photo-catalysis for producing H-2 are also highlighted. (C) 2019 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

There are 158 metabolites measured by NMR spectroscopy in the 31-year follow-up of the Northern Finland Birth Cohort 1966 (NFBC66). These metabolites, as with many multivariate phenotypes produced by high-throughput biomarker technology, exhibit strong correlation structures. Existing approaches for combining such data with genetic variants for multivariate QTL analysis generally ignore phenotypic correlations or make restrictive assumptions about the associations between phenotypes and genetic loci. We present a computationally efficient Bayesian seemingly unrelated regressions model for high-dimensional data, with cell-sparse variable selection and sparse graphical structure for covariance selection. Cell sparsity allows different phenotype responses to be associated with different genetic predictors and the graphical structure is used to represent the conditional dependencies between phenotype variables. To achieve feasible computation of the large model space, we exploit a factorisation of the covariance matrix. Applying the model to the NFBC66 data with 9000 directly genotyped single nucleotide polymorphisms, we are able to simultaneously estimate genotype-phenotype associations and the residual dependence structure among the metabolites.

206,Risk assessment of corroded casing based on analytic hierarchy process and fuzzy comprehensive evaluation,"Chen, Sheng-Shan; Wang, Han-Xiang; Jiang, Hao; Liu, Ya-Nan; Liu, Yan-Xin; Lv, Xiao-Xiao","Casing corrosion during CO(2)injection or storage results in significant economic loss and increased production risks. Therefore, in this paper, a corroded casing risk assessment model based on analytic hierarchy process and fuzzy comprehensive evaluation is established to identify potential risks in time. First, the corrosion rate and residual strength characteristics are analyzed through corrosion tests and numerical simulations, respectively, to determine the risk factors that may lead to an accident. Then, an index system for corroded casing risk evaluation is established based on six important factors: temperature, CO(2)partial pressure, flow velocity, corrosion radius, corrosion depth and wellhead pressure. Subsequently, the index weights are calculated via the analytic hierarchy process. Finally, the risk level of corroded casing is obtained via the fuzzy comprehensive evaluation. The corroded casing risk assessment model has been verified by a case well, which shows that the model is valuable and feasible. It provides an effective decision-making method for the risk evaluation of corroded casing in CO(2)injection well, which is conductive to improve the wellbore operation efficiency."
207,The COVID-19 Pandemic and Its Implications for Rural Economies,"Phillipson, Jeremy; Gorton, Matthew; Turner, Roger; Shucksmith, Mark; Aitken-McDermott, Katie; Areal, Francisco; Cowie, Paul; Hubbard, Carmen; Maioli, Sara; McAreavey, Ruth; Souza-Monteiro, Diogo; Newbery, Robert; Panzone, Luca; Rowe, Frances; Shortall, Sally","This paper presents a rapid assessment of current and likely future impacts of the COVID-19 outbreak on rural economies given their socio-economic characteristics. Drawing principally on current evidence for the UK, as well as lessons from the 2001 Foot and Mouth Disease outbreak and the 2007/8 financial crises, it outlines the likely key demand and supply effects, paying attention to the situation for agriculture as well as discussing the implications for rural communities. A distinction is made between the effects on businesses offering goods and services for out-of-home as opposed to in-home consumption. Gendered dimensions are also noted as likely business and household strategies for coping and adaptation. The paper concludes with a brief mapping of a research agenda for studying the longer-term effects of COVID-19 on rural economies."
208,CrowdMed-II: a blockchain-based framework for efficient consent management in health data sharing,"Chaochen Hu,Chao Li,Guigang Zhang,Zhiwei Lei,Mira Shah,Yong Zhang,Chunxiao Xing,Jinpeng Jiang,Renyi Bao,Chaochen Hu,Chao Li,Guigang Zhang,Zhiwei Lei,Mira Shah,Yong Zhang,Chunxiao Xing,Jinpeng Jiang,Renyi Bao","The healthcare industry faces serious problems with health data. Firstly, health data is fragmented and its quality needs to be improved. Data fragmentation means that it is difficult to integrate the patient data stored by multiple health service providers. The quality of these heterogeneous data also needs to be improved for better utilization. Secondly, data sharing among patients, healthcare service providers and medical researchers is inadequate. Thirdly, while sharing health data, patients' right to privacy must be protected, and patients should have authority over who can access their data. In traditional health data sharing system, because of centralized management, data can easily be stolen, manipulated. These systems also ignore patient's authority and privacy. Researchers have proposed some blockchain-based health data sharing solutions where blockchain is used for consensus management. Blockchain enables multiple parties who do not fully trust each other to exchange their data. However, the practice of smart contracts supporting these solutions has not been studied in detail. We propose CrowdMed-II, a health data management framework based on blockchain, which could address the above-mentioned problems of health data. We study the design of major smart contracts in our framework and propose two smart contract structures. We also introduce a novel search contract for searching patients in the framework. We evaluate their efficiency based on the execution costs on Ethereum. Our design improves on those previously proposed, lowering the computational costs of the framework. This allows the framework to operate at scale and is more feasible for widespread adoption."
209,Design of the lentivirus-driven sustained LR12 delivery system for TREM-1 inhibition for palliating atherosclerosis,"Finosh G Thankam,David J Sanchez,Devendra K Agrawal,Finosh G Thankam,David J Sanchez,Devendra K Agrawal","Triggering Receptor Expressed on Myeloid cells-1 (TREM-1) has been a potential target in the management of pathophysiology and clinical sequelae of atherosclerosis. LR12 peptide effectively blocks ligand-TREM-1 interaction; however, the short half-life of LR12 is a major hurdle in its translational application in atherosclerosis management warranting new methods for sustained bioavailability in clinical applications. The present study reports a novel method of packing the coding sequence of LR12 in a lentiviral system to ensure a sustained expression and bioavailability for effective TREM-1 inhibition. Lentivirus vector systems (LV-LR12 and LV-SP) for the expression of LR12 peptide and SP (scrambled peptide) were successfully designed, constructed, and tested in vitro in smooth muscle cells (SMCs). Viral amounts obtained were 703.6 ± 145.12 and 609.3 ± 145.93 ng/ml p24 for LV-LR12 and LV-SP, respectively which correspond to ~ 107 IFU/ml for both vectors. Dot blot assay revealed significantly increased expression of LR12-FLAG and SP-FLAG in 125 μg total protein which was doubled in 250 μg protein with respect to un-transduced SMCs suggesting the sustained release of LR12/SP as confirmed by ELISA. Cellular expression of LR12-FLAG and SP-FLAG displayed 8.44-fold and 7.55-fold increase, respectively compared to the control SMCs. The findings demonstrated a promising strategy for packing the LR12 coding sequence in lentiviral vector for TREM-1 inhibition for the management of atherosclerosis and other inflammatory diseases."

We report an unusual case of Brown-Sequard syndrome in a 55-year-old man who presented at the ED with right-sided weakness and contralateral loss of pain and temperature sensation after a cervical epidural injection for shoulder pain. Cervicla spine magnetic resonance imaging showed an epidural hematoma from C4 to C6. After admission, his right hemiparesis and contralateral sensory loss improved within eight days, and surgical decompression was not required. Diagnosing spinal lesions in the ED is challenging, especially in patients with acute neurological signs requiring immediate evaluation for stroke. In this case, definite hemiparesis and some contralateral sensory loss were noted. Therefore, a potential spinal lesion was suspected rather than a stroke. This case emphasized the importance of conducting a focused neurological examination after history taking."
211,Cardiorenal Effects of Long-Term Phosphodiesterase V Inhibition in Pre-Heart Failure,"Scott A Hubers,Siu-Hin Wan,Fadi W Adel,Sherry L Benike,John C Burnett Jr,Christopher Scott,Horng H Chen,Scott A Hubers,Siu-Hin Wan,Fadi W Adel,Sherry L Benike,John C Burnett Jr,Christopher Scott,Horng H Chen","Background Phosphodiesterase V (PDEV) is upregulated in heart failure, leading to increased degradation of cGMP and impaired natriuresis. PDEV inhibition improves the renal response to B-type natriuretic peptide in animal models. We tested the hypothesis that long-term PDEV inhibition would improve renal function and cardiorenal response after short-term volume load in subjects with pre-heart failure. Methods and Results A total of 20 subjects with pre-heart failure (defined as an ejection fraction ≤45% without previous diagnosis of heart failure) and renal impairment were randomized in a 2:1 manner to tadalafil or placebo. Baseline echocardiography and renal clearance study were performed, followed by a short-term saline load and repeated echocardiography and renal clearance study. Subjects then received either tadalafil at a goal dose of 20 mg daily or placebo, and the study day was repeated after 12 weeks. Long-term tadalafil did not improve glomerular filtration rate (median increase of 2.0 mL/min in the tadalafil group versus 13.5 mL/min in the placebo group; P=0.54). There was no difference in urinary sodium or cGMP excretion with PDEV inhibition following short-term saline loading. Conclusions Glomerular filtration rate and urinary sodium/cGMP excretion were not significantly different after 12 weeks of tadalafil compared with placebo. These results do not support the use of PDEV inhibition to improve renal response in patients with pre-heart failure.

Evidence of working memory processes involved,"Leandro da Silva-Sauer,Ricardo Basso Garcia,Alan Ehrich de Moura,Bernardino Fernández-Calvo,Leandro da Silva-Sauer,Ricardo Basso Garcia,Alan Ehrich de Moura,Bernardino Fernández-Calvo","The d2 Test of Attention (d2) is widely used for assessing sustained attention and we aimed at verifying whether working memory may be a secondary construct measured by d2. 70 university students were assessed using d2 conventional paper-and-pencil and computational version. The experimental group and control group performed the task with or without target key, respectively. Continuous Performance Test (CPT) and N-back (1 and 2-back) tasks were used to measure sustained attention and working memory, respectively. Computational d2 performance was predicted by CPT (p < .05; R2 = .15) in the experimental group, and it was predicted by 2-back (p < .05; R2 = .28) in the control group. Conventional d2 performance was predicted by 2-back for both control group (p = .01; R2 = .20) and experimental group (p = .02, R2 = .17). Results suggest the involvement of working memory in d2, possibly a secondary construct assessed by this instrument."
213,Hidden toxins: bathtubs as a potential source of lead exposure in children,"Joanna Balza,Joanna Balza","Exposure to lead (Pb) remains a serious health concern for children in the United States, particularly those residing in deteriorating housing. While some sources of Pb such as deteriorating paint and lead waterworks are relatively well understood and widely known, other sources remain hidden. One potential hidden source is bathtubs. In this experiment, water resting in a leaded bathtub was tested over a course of 60 min to determine the extent of metal leaching from the tub to the water. Lead levels in the water increased from 6.8 μg/L at baseline to 13 μg/L after resting in the tub for 60 min. Further research is needed to understand if this is typical, the contributing factors, and clinical significance of this finding."
214,Role of the nurse in supporting patients to self-manage their medicines effectively,"Sue Latter,Sue Latter","Medicines are an integral element of the effective management of many clinical conditions. As people live longer, many of them will experience multiple long-term conditions, and will frequently require various prescribed medicines. Patients, their family members and/or carers will often have to manage their medicines at home without the assistance of nurses or other healthcare professionals. In addition, many patients do not adhere to their medicine regimens, either unintentionally due to issues such as memory loss, or intentionally because of fears about side effects, for example. This article explains how nurses practising in hospital, community and primary care settings can support patients to self-manage their medicines effectively, in accordance with the principles of shared decision-making and person-centred care."
215,Bi-Level Programming for Optimal Operation of an Active Distribution Network With Multiple Virtual Power Plants,"Yi, Zhongkai; Xu, Yinliang; Zhou, Jianguo; Wu, Wenchuan; Sun, Hongbin","Virtual power plants (VPPs) have become an effective technique to manage a growing number of flexible resources, which have posed great technical challenges to distribution system operators (DSOs). This article proposes a bi-level programming approach for the collaborative management of an active distribution network (ADN) with multiple VPPs by designing comprehensive prices for active and reactive power. The upper layer aims to minimize the overall operation cost of the ADN considering the system security and economic operation and the interactions among the power market, ADN and VPPs. The lower layer aims to maximize the benefits of each VPP agent considering various flexible resources. Then, the bi-level model is transformed into a tractable single-level problem by using a linearization method, the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) optimality conditions, the Fortuny-Amat transformation and the strong duality theorem. Case analyses indicate that the proposed strategy can effectively enhance the system security and improve the system economic performance by introducing reactive power pricing. The implementation effect and superiority of the proposed strategy are profoundly analyzed under different scenarios and conditions, which indicates its promising application value in the industrial field."
216,Targeted Treatment of Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia: Clinical Utility of Acalabrutinib,"Candida Vitale,Jamie Lynn Gibbons,Alessandra Ferrajoli,Candida Vitale,Jamie Lynn Gibbons,Alessandra Ferrajoli","In chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), a deeper understanding of the disease biology led over the last decade to the development and clinical use of different targeted drugs, including Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitors. The first BTK inhibitor approved for clinical use is ibrutinib, which showed excellent efficacy and good tolerability. More recently, the interest is growing for novel more selective BTK inhibitors that may reduce the off-target effects of the drug, thus minimizing side effects and subsequent treatment interruptions or discontinuations. Acalabrutinib is an orally administered irreversible BTK inhibitor, characterized by the lack of inhibition towards other kinases. In this review, we present the most recent data from clinical trials on the clinical efficacy of acalabrutinib and acalabrutinib-based combinations for the treatment of patients with relapsed/refractory and treatment-naïve CLL. We delineate the safety profile of the drug, describe side effects of interest and discuss the clinical management of patients receiving acalabrutinib. Due to its efficacy and the favorable safety profile, acalabrutinib has emerged as a viable therapy option in the current landscape of multiple approved treatments for CLL."
217,Modelling and optimisation of a hybrid PV-wind turbine-pumped hydro storage energy system for mini-grid application in coastline communities,"Nyeche, E. N.; Diemuodeke, E. O.","This study proposes a clean, reliable and affordable hybrid energy conversion technology that is based on sunlight and wind, with a hydro based energy storage system. The proposed system comprises Photovoltaic arrays, wind turbine (WT) and Pumped Hydro Energy Storage (PHES). The study was focused on satisfying energy demand of a typical coastline community, Patani (Lat. 5.23 degrees N and Long. 6.17 degrees E) - a Local Government Area (LGA). Genetic algorithm was adopted to optimise the PHES of the proposed hybrid plant to minimise the difference between energy demand and energy generated. Economic models were developed to ascertain the economic feasibility of the hybrid plant. High fidelity software (HOMER (R), MATLAB (R) and MS Excel (R) spreadsheet) were utilised for the analysis and optimisation. The peak rated power of PV and WT required to satisfy the energy demand of the LGA are 217 kW(p) and 226050 kW, respectively. The minimum storage capacity of the PHES was estimated at about 3,930,615 kWh, with the upper reservoir volume of 43170.06 m(3). The value of 0.27 $/kWh was obtained for the Levelised Cost of Energy (LCOE); while the loss of load probability of the proposed energy system was estimated at 0.1086. The proposed energy system supports the Sustainable Development Goal 7 - affordable and clean energy, with climate change mitigation potential. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."
218,Spatiotemporal regularity and spillover effects of carbon emission intensity in China's Bohai Economic Rim,"Song, Mei; Wu, Jin; Song, Mengran; Zhang, Liyan; Zhu, Yaxu","The Bohai Economic Rim (BER) is a momentous economic growth district with rapid development in northern China, but the environmental problems there have also become prominent. In 2017 the BER's carbon emission intensity outclassed the national average, the emission reduction situation was also grim. For clarifying the influence mechanism of the economy on carbon emission intensity, this paper explores the spatiotemporal regularity, the spatial correlation, and the spillover effect in carbon emission intensity employing the Moran index and the spatial Durbin model. The results indicate that the carbon emission intensity in the BER decreased year-by-year from 2006 to 2017. Shanxi and Inner Mongolia were emission hot spots, whereas Beijing and Tianjin were emission cold spots. And the Moran's I values all passed the significance test, which verified the spatial correlation of the carbon emission intensity in the BER is significant. Urbanization, energy intensity, population density, and industry structure have a biggish impact on such spatial distribution of the carbon emission intensity. The direct effect coefficient of the energy intensity is the highest, and the spillover effect of the industry structure is the most significant Finally, this paper puts forward suggestions on the formulation of regional coordinated carbon reduction programs in the BER.

When using 4-nitrophenols a rare 1,3-Truce-Smiles rearrangement is observed leading to diarylacetamide derivatives. 2-Nitro-derivatives lead to a completely different reactivity pattern that may be explained by a nitro to nitroso conversion followed by a σ-π metathesis. All mechanistic assumptions are confirmed by DFT calculations performed on both families of adducts. The potential of this work has been further demonstrated by the use of N-aryl α-ketoamides as alternative starting materials for these cascades as well as the disclosure of new aza-Nazarov access to hydroxy-indolones."

However, established chiral HOMHs often suffer from their relatively small band gaps, which lead to negative impacts on transparent window and laser-induced damage thresholds (LDT). Here, we have synthesized two chiral HOMHs based on CuI halides, namely (R-/S-MBA)CuBr2 , which feature well-balanced NLO performances with a highly efficient SHG response, outstanding optical transparency, and high LDT. The effective second-order NLO coefficient of (R-MBA)CuBr2 has been determined to be ≈24.7 pm V-1 , which is two orders of magnitude higher than that of their CuII counterparts. This work shows the promising potential of CuI -based chiral HOMHs for nonlinear photonic applications in wide wavelength regions."
221,Prediction intervals of the COVID-19 cases by HAR models with growth rates and vaccination rates in top eight affected countries: Bootstrap improvement,"Eunju Hwang,Eunju Hwang","This paper is devoted to modeling and predicting COVID-19 confirmed cases through a multiple linear regression. Especially, prediction intervals of the COVID-19 cases are extensively studied. Due to long-memory feature of the COVID-19 data, a heterogeneous autoregression (HAR) is adopted with Growth rates and Vaccination rates; it is called HAR-G-V model. Top eight affected countries are taken with their daily confirmed cases and vaccination rates. Model criteria results such as root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), R 2  , AIC and BIC are reported in the HAR models with/without the two rates. The HAR-G-V model performs better than other HAR models. Out-of-sample forecasting by the HAR-G-V model is conducted. Forecast accuracy measures such as RMSE, MAE, mean absolute percentage error and root relative square error are computed. Furthermore, three types of prediction intervals are constructed by approximating residuals to normal and Laplace distributions, as well as by employing bootstrap procedure. Empirical coverage probability, average length and mean interval score are evaluated for the three prediction intervals. This work contributes three folds: a novel trial to combine both growth rates and vaccination rates in modeling COVID-19; construction and comparison of three types of prediction intervals; and an attempt to improve coverage probability and mean interval score of prediction intervals via bootstrap technique."
222,Allocating planetary boundaries to large economies: Distributional consequences of alternative perspectives on distributive fairness,"Lucas, Paul L.; Wilting, Harry C.; Hof, Andries F.; van Vuuren, Detlef P.","The planetary boundaries (PBs) framework proposes global quantitative precautionary limits for human perturbation of nine critical Earth system processes. Together they define a global safe operating space for human development. Translating the global limits to the national level increases their policy relevance. Such translation essentially divides up the global safe operating space. What is considered fair distribution is a political decision and there is no globally agreed principle that can be applied. Here, we analyse the distributional consequences of alternative perspectives on distributive fairness. We scale the global limits of selected PBs to resource budgets for the EU, US, China and India, using three allocation approaches from the climate change literature. Furthermore, we compare the allocated budgets to 2010 environmental footprints of the four economies, to assess their performance with respect to the selected PBs. The allocation approaches are based on (1) current shares of global environmental pressure ('grandfathering'); (2) 'equal per capita' shares, and (3) 'ability to pay' to reduce environmental pressure. The results show that the four economies are not living within the global safe operating space. Their 2010 environmental footprints are larger than the allocated budgets for all approaches and parameterisations analysed for the PBs for climate change and biogeochemical flows, and, except for India, also for the PB for biosphere integrity. Grandfathering was found to be most favourable for the EU and US for all PBs, and ability to pay as least favourable. For climate change and biogeochemical flows, ability to pay even resulted in negative resource budgets for the two economies. In contrast, for China and India, equal per capita allocation and ability to pay were most favourable. Results were sensitive to the parameterisation. Accounting for future population growth in the equal per capita approach benefits India, with lower budgets for the EU, US and China, while accounting for future economic growth in ability to pay benefits the EU and US, with lower budgets for China and India. Our results underline the need for all four economies to act, while hinting at diverging preferences for specific allocation approaches. The methodology and results may help countries to define policy targets in line with global ambitions, such as those defined by the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), accounting for differences in countries' circumstances and capacities. Further attention is required for PB-specific allocation approaches and integration of biophysical and socioeconomic considerations in the allocation."
223,"Spatiotemporal Dynamics and Driving Forces of Urban Land-Use Expansion: A Case Study of the Yangtze River Economic Belt, China","Zhong, Yang; Lin, Aiwen; He, Lijie; Zhou, Zhigao; Yuan, Moxi","It is important to analyze the expansion of an urban area and the factors that drive its expansion. Therefore, this study is based on Defense Meteorological Satellite Program Operational Linescan System (DMSP/OLS) night lighting data, using the landscape index, spatial expansion strength index, compactness index, urban land fractal index, elasticity coefficient, the standard deviation ellipse, spatial correlation analysis, and partial least squares regression to analyze the spatial and temporal evolution of urban land expansion and its driving factors in the Yangtze River Economic Belt (YREB) over a long period of time. The results show the following: Through the calculation of the eight landscape pattern indicators, we found that during the study period, the number of cities and towns and the area of urban built-up areas in the YREB are generally increasing. Furthermore, the variations in these landscape pattern indicators not only show more frequent exchanges and interactions between the cities and towns of the YREB, but also reflect significant instability and irregularity of the urbanization development in the YREB. The spatial expansion intensity indices of 1992-1999, 1999-2006, and 2006-2013 were 0.03, 0.16, and 0.34, respectively. On the whole, the urban compactness of the YREB decreased with time, and the fractal dimension increased slowly with time. Moreover, the long axis and the short axis of the standard deviation ellipse of the YREB underwent a small change during the inspection period. The spatial distribution generally showed the pattern of ""southwest-north"". In terms of gravity shift, during the study period, the center of gravity moved from northeast to southwest. In addition, the Moran's I values for the four years of 1992, 1999, 2006, and 2013 were 0.451, 0.495, 0.506, and 0.424, respectively. Furthermore, by using correlation analysis, we find that the correlation coefficients between these four driving indicators and the urban expansion of the YREB were: 0.963, 0.998, 0.990 and 0.994, respectively. Through the use of partial least squares regression, we found that in 1992-2013, the four drivers of urban land expansion in the YREB were ranked as follows: gross domestic product (GDP), total fixed asset investment, urban population, total retail sales of consumer goods."
224,A step to clean energy - Sustainability in energy system management in an emerging economy context,"Mangla, Sachin Kumar; Luthra, Sunil; Jakhar, Suresh; Gandhi, Sumeet; Muduli, Kamalakanta; Kumar, Anil","Due to high consumption of energy, its associated concerns such as energy security and demand, wastage of resources, and material-energy recovery are leading to the importance of sustainable energy system development. This is a high time to assess the sustainability in energy systems for meeting the requirements of energy with an enhanced economic, ecological, and social performance from a nation context. The energy system plays a significant role in deciding the economic progress of emerging economies such as India, China, Brazil, and Africa. In this paper, an original attempt has been made to list and evaluate important indicators for sustainability assessment of energy systems development and management in an emerging economy especially India. Firstly, based on the analysis of the extant literature and then followed by expert opinion, potential key sustainability assessment indicators for energy systems development and management were identified. Further, grey based Decision-Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory technique to understand the causal interactions amongst indicators and segregate them into cause and effect groups, is used. This work can provide useful aids to decision making bodies, sustainability practitioners and business organisations in selective implementation, monitoring and control of sustainable strategies in energy systems development and management and meeting sustainable development goals of clean energy in a nation context.

225,Engineering of a protein probe with multiple inputs and multiple outputs for evaluation of alpha synuclein aggregation states,"Edward Chau,Jin Ryoun Kim,Edward Chau,Jin Ryoun Kim","The aggregation of α-synuclein (αS) into oligomers and fibrils is implicated in the pathology of Parkinson's Disease (PD). While a molecular probe for rapid and comprehensive evaluation of αS aggregation states is critical for a better understanding of PD pathology, identification of therapeutic candidates, and the development of early diagnostic strategies, no such probe has yet to be developed. A structurally flexible αS variant, PG65, was previously developed as a target binding-driven, conformation-switching molecular probe for rapid αS oligomer detection. Though informative, detection using PG65 provides no comprehensive assessment of the αS aggregation states. In the present study, we report engineering of a molecular probe, PG65-MIMO (a PG65 variant with Multiple-Inputs and Multiple-Outputs), that rapidly (within 2 hr) produces comprehensive information on αS aggregation states. PG65-MIMO generates distinct fluorescence responses to the three major αS conformers (monomers, oligomers, and fibrils). PG65-MIMO also displays unique fluorescent signals for αS oligomers, depending on the tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP) concentration. Our results suggest that the TCEP dependent signaling of PG65-MIMO may be associated with its conformational states. Overall, our study illustrates engineering of an αS variant to create a molecular probe for handling multiple inputs and multiple outputs, addressing the technological gap in αS detection."
226,Consumption-based carbon emissions and International trade in G7 countries: The role of Environmental innovation and Renewable energy,"Khan, Zeeshan; Ali, Shahid; Umar, Muhammad; Kirikkaleli, Dervis; Jiao, Zhilun","The role of a reliable carbon emissions measurement is important for devising a relevant climate policy to deals with environmental problems. Based on trade adjusted statistics of carbon emissions, a relevant climate policy response can be provided, especially following the conference of Paris (COP, 21). To explore the unidentified determinants of CO2 emissions in G7 countries from 1990 to 2017, this study uses second-generation panel co-integration methodologies. Results of P&Y's slope heterogeneity test and Pesaran's CD test confirm the existence of correlation among cross-sectional units and slope heterogeneity across countries. The results confirm a stable long-run relationship among CO2 emissions, trade, income, environmental innovation and renewable energy consumption. In the long run, imports and income enhance consumption-based carbon emissions, while exports, environmental innovation and renewable energy consumption are helpful in abating consumption-based CO2 emissions. The results are also reconfirmed by Augmented Mean Group (AMG) and Common Correlated Effect Mean Group (CCEMG) methods. Based on the results of the Dumitrescu and Hurlin (2012) Granger causality test, it is argued that any policy to target exports, imports, income and environmental innovation significantly changes CO2 emissions. On the contrary, any policy to support environmental degradation does not affect these variables. Moreover, any policy to target renewable energy sources significantly affects consumption-based CO2 emissions and vice versa. This might lead the policymakers to adopt strategies that are eco-friendly such as the deployment of renewable energy and environmental innovation to attain sustainable environment.

227,"The asymmetric effect of tourism, financial development, and globalization on ecological footprint in Turkey","Godil, Danish Iqbal; Sharif, Arshian; Rafique, Saima; Jermsittiparsert, Kittisak","With the growing interest among researchers in analyzing the ecological footprint of any country, this study focuses on new dimensions to analyze the long-run and short-run asymmetric impact of tourism, financial development, and globalization on ecological footprint in Turkey by using Quantile Autoregressive Distributed Lag model for the period from 1986 to 2018. Further, the EKC hypothesis was also tested. The results show that tourism, globalization, and financial development are positively and significantly associated with the EFP. This means that the increase in these variables will further increase the ecological footprint in Turkey. The U-shaped EKC curve was found to be valid in Turkey. The results also depict nonlinear and asymmetric association among most of the variables. Hence, based on the results, further research directions and practical implications can be suggested."

Old greenspaces that were fragmented from natural habitats are now overcrowded, while revegetated new greenspaces remain vacant. This is because they have different processes leading towards biodiversity equilibrium, and conservation management needs to differentiate between fragmented and revegetated greenspaces."
229,Comparison of PsbQ and Psb27 in photosystem II provides insight into their roles,"Christopher J Gisriel,Gary W Brudvig,Christopher J Gisriel,Gary W Brudvig","Photosystem II (PSII) catalyzes the oxidation of water at its active site that harbors a high-valent inorganic Mn4CaOx cluster called the oxygen-evolving complex (OEC). Extrinsic subunits generally serve to protect the OEC from reductants and stabilize the structure, but diversity in the extrinsic subunits exists between phototrophs. Recent cryo-electron microscopy experiments have provided new molecular structures of PSII with varied extrinsic subunits. We focus on the extrinsic subunit PsbQ, that binds to the mature PSII complex, and on Psb27, an extrinsic subunit involved in PSII biogenesis. PsbQ and Psb27 share a similar binding site and have a four-helix bundle tertiary structure, suggesting they are related. Here, we use sequence alignments, structural analyses, and binding simulations to compare PsbQ and Psb27 from different organisms. We find no evidence that PsbQ and Psb27 are related despite their similar structures and binding sites. Evolutionary divergence within PsbQ homologs from different lineages is high, probably due to their interactions with other extrinsic subunits that themselves exhibit vast diversity between lineages. This may result in functional variation as exemplified by large differences in their calculated binding energies. Psb27 homologs generally exhibit less divergence, which may be due to stronger evolutionary selection for certain residues that maintain its function during PSII biogenesis and this is consistent with their more similar calculated binding energies between organisms. Previous experimental inconsistencies, low confidence binding simulations, and recent structural data suggest that Psb27 is likely to exhibit flexibility that may be an important characteristic of its activity. The analysis provides insight into the functions and evolution of PsbQ and Psb27, and an unusual example of proteins with similar tertiary structures and binding sites that probably serve different roles."
230,Advances in nutrient management make it possible to accelerate biogas production and thus improve the economy of food waste processing,"Marousek, Josef; Strunecky, Otakar; Kolar, Ladislav; Vochozka, Marek; Kopecky, Marek; Marouskova, Anna; Batt, Jana; Poliak, Milos; Soch, Miloslav; Bartos, Petr; Kliestik, Tomas; Filip, Martin; Konvalina, Petr; Moudry, Jan; Peterka, Jiri; Suchy, Karel; Zoubek, Tomas; Cera, Edmond","Foodwaste (hereinafter, FW) is the most voluminous solid waste and its amount is growing rapidly all over the world. The turning of FW into biogas via anaerobic fermentation is widely recognized as an environmentally responsible and economically reasonable option. Based on the knowledge obtained from agricultural biogas stations, the current methods of FW fermentation management are based on balancing the ratio of total carbon and nitrogen. However, it was repeatedly and independently reported that the stability of this process is low, resulting in many concessions in terms of prolonged hydraulic retention time or reduced biogas yield. Hence, biochemical as well as economic performance of the process is balanced by mixing of FW with agricultural residues. FW samples of various origin were collected and biochemically analyzed. The data indicate that FW originating from homes and luxury restaurants tends to be lignocellulose-based, whereas the levels of crude fiber (25% up to 27%) are higher than those from agricultural feedstock (18%). In contrast, FW from school canteens and inexpensive restaurants tends to be starch-based with high levels of amyloids (21% up to 23%) and fat (5% up to 7%). A novel method better reflecting the bioavailability of carbon and nitrogen to anaerobic consortia is proposed. It is demonstrated that the previous optimization methods could somehow reflect the availability of nutrients in agricultural feedstock, as carbonaceous and nitrogen sources are relatively equally biodegradable. Nevertheless, the biodegradability of FW is considerably different, which is why higher amounts of proteins and lipids lead to increased levels of ammonia and sulfide, resulting in an inhibitory effect on the metabolism of anaerobic consortia. Optimizing the anaerobic fermentation of FW by the new method outperforms the previous technique and makes it possible to process FW more intensively, or, more precisely, with higher profitability and lower proportion of ballast agricultural feedstock."
231,Shape-stable thermo-responsive nano Fe3O4/fatty acids/PET composite phase-change material for thermal energy management and saving applications,"Rezaie, Ali Bashiri; Montazer, Majid","Organic phase change materials are sensitive to temperature calling thermo-responsive materials having ability of thermal energy storage/release in a warm/cold medium through latent heat, indicating proper potential for better thermal energy management. Nonetheless, leakage during melting and undesirable thermal conductivity are considered as two major disadvantages. Herein, for the first time, a simple one-step route is suggested for preparing novel shape-stable nano Fe3O4/fatty acids/PET composite can be utilized in thermal energy saving and management applications. This is based on simultaneous embedment of fatty acids as phase change materials into polyester (PET) fibers as supporting material and formation of iron oxide nanoparticles. The present approach not only obviates two stated drawbacks but also it is free from separately forming or providing nanoparticles and utilizing micro/nano encapsulation or electrospinning which may contain toxic chemicals. It is further conducted in one-single step preferring in the view of both economic and environmental aspects. The composites indicated promising phase temperature intervals of 36.3-54.1 and 26.9-35.5 degrees C for melting and freezing with latent heats of 40.3-59.7 and 40.1-58.2 J/g, respectively. The embedment of iron oxide nanoparticles resulted in thermal conductivity elevation around 44.5-85.8%. The prepared samples displayed good thermal endurance and reliability after 100 thermal treatments. They also had no leakage even after 120 min at 75 degrees C revealed their appropriate leakage-proof property in real usages. Overall, the paper introduces an affordable one-step mode for fabricating shape-stable nano-enhanced composite with proper thermal features for practical thermal energy management and saving applications."
232,"Chromodomain Helicase DNA Binding Protein 1-like, a negative regulator of Forkhead box O3a, promotes the proliferation and migration of Angiotensin II-induced vascular smooth muscle cells","Xueyao Zhang,Yingxian Sun,Xueyao Zhang,Yingxian Sun","Essential hypertension (EH) represents a major risk factor for stroke, myocardial infarction, and heart failure. Dysregulated proliferation and migration of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) play an important role in pathogenesis of EH. This study aims to investigate the effect of Chromodomain Helicase DNA Binding Protein 1-Like (CHD1L) on Angiotensin II (AngII)-induced VSMCs injury and reveal the underlying mechanism. The expression of CHD1L in EH patients was determined by bioinformatics analysis, and then it was silenced in AngII-induced VSMCs to detect the changes in cellular functions including proliferation, migration, invasion and phenotypic switching via CCK-8, EDU staining, wound healing, transwell and Western blot assays, respectively. Inflammation and oxidative stress were also measured by detecting related markers via commercial kits. After confirming the binding sites between forkhead box O3A (FOXO3a) and CHD1L and their negative association by bioinformatics analysis, FOXO3a was further silenced, and the cellular functions were assessed again to reveal the underlying mechanism. Results showed that CHD1L was highly expressed in EH, and interference of CHD1L suppressed the proliferation, migration, invasion and phenotypic switching in VSMCs. Inflammation and oxidative stress were also restrained by CHD1L knockdown. After validating the negative role of FOXO3a in regulating CHD1L, it was found that FOXO3a abrogated the effect of CHD1L knockdown on the cellular functions of AngII-induced VSMCs. In conclusion, FOXO3a suppresses the proliferation and migration of AngII-induced VSMCs by down-regulating CHD1L."
233,Does physical weight alter the mental representation of the body? Evidence from motor imagery in obesity,"Federica Scarpina,Clara Paschino,Massimo Scacchi,Alessandro Mauro,Anna Sedda,Federica Scarpina,Clara Paschino,Massimo Scacchi,Alessandro Mauro,Anna Sedda","Obesity is a clinical condition that impacts severely the physical body. However, evidence related to the mental representation of the body in action is scarce. The few available studies only focus on avoiding obstacles, rather than participants imagining their own body. To advance knowledge in this field, we assessed the performance of 22 individuals with obesity compared with 30 individuals with a healthy weight in two tasks that implied different motor (more implicit vs. more explicit) imagery strategies. Two tasks were also administered to control for visual imagery skills, to rule out confounding factors. Moreover, we measured body uneasiness, through a standard questionnaire, as body image negativity could impact on other body representation components. Our findings do not show differences in the motor imagery tasks between individuals with obesity and individuals with healthy weight. On the other hand, some differences emerge in visual imagery skills. Crucially, individuals with obesity did report a higher level of body uneasiness. Despite a negative body image and visual imagery differences, obesity per se does not impact on the representation of the body in action. Importantly, this result is independent from the level of awareness required to access the mental representation of the body."
234,"The environmental sustainability effects of income, labour force, and tourism development in OECD countries","Lasisi, Taiwo T.; Alola, Andrew A.; Eluwole, Kayode K.; Ozturen, Ali; Alola, Uju V.","The impacts of the increasing human activities mostly through socio-economic and environment interactions have continued to generate more scientific studies and contemporary discussion on issues ranging from the climate change to income and gender gap. Accordingly, the current study employed the cointegration and a two-step (system) SYS-Generalized Method of Moments to examine the environmental sustainability effects of income, international tourism arrivals, and labour force vis-a-vis gender unemployment in the panel of (32) Organization for Economic Development and Corporation (OECD) for the period 1995-2016. The study revealed that income growth in the OECD countries and increase in the inflow of international tourists into the OECD member countries are significant endangering factors for the bloc's environmental sustainability. More striking is the environmental impact of labour force in the panel countries. Intuitively, a positive labour force-environmental degradation nexus is expected; the negatively desirable labour force-environmental degradation nexus in the current study is a justification of (1) the prevailing gender employment/unemployment classifications in the OECD member countries, and (2) the increasing adoption of more environmental friendlier working conditions or operation among the member countries. Moreover, the current study strongly posits a significant policy framework for the governments and stakeholders of the OECD member countries."
235,Techno-economic analysis of a grid-connected PV/battery system using the teaching-learning-based optimization algorithm,"Ashtiani, Mina Najafi; Toopshekan, Ashkan; Astaraei, Fatemeh Razi; Yousefi, Hossein; Maleki, Akbar","In this paper, a novel framework for optimal sizing of a grid-connected photovoltaic (PV)/battery system is presented to minimize the total net present cost using a novel optimization algorithm based on the teaching and learning process, namely Teaching-Learning-Based Optimization (TLBO). The TLBO algorithm is an efficient optimization method based on the teacher's influence on the learners' output in a class. This article shows how backup PV/battery systems can reduce electricity bills, even in countries where their electricity is cheap and subsidized. In comparison to the non-renewable case, the net present cost (NPC) and the cost of energy (COE) of the on-grid PV/battery system are 15.6% and 16.8% more efficient, respectively. The NPC and COE factors were calculated and compared with two other popular optimization algorithms, particle swarm optimization, and genetic algorithm to validate the proposed approach and to ascertain the strength and accuracy of the TLBO algorithm. To compare the results, different cities were examined and the similarity of the results showed that the system is efficient regardless of the surrounding climate. Also, sensitivity analyses on different cities' climatic data, different load demands and PV prices outlined the economic optimal size of the system."
236,Interplay between technological innovation and environmental quality: Formulating the SDG policies for next 11 economies,"Sinha, Avik; Sengupta, Tuhin; Alvarado, Rafael","Since the inception of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), the Next 11 (N11) countries are facing difficulties in attaining the SDG objectives, as maintaining the environmental quality has been a challenge for them. In this study, we have revisited the technology policies of these countries, and in doing so, we have tried to address the problem of environmental degradation, while addressing the issues of sustained economic growth, clean and affordable energy, and quality education. In this pursuit, we have designed two indices for environmental degradation and technological advancement, and then analyzed the association between them following the Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) hypothesis. The empirical analysis has been done by IPAT framework, and by using bootstrapped quantile regression and rolling window heterogeneous panel casualty tests, over a period of 1990-2017. Following the results obtained from the analysis, we have tried to address the objectives of SDG 13, SDG 4, SDG 8, SDG 9, SDG 7, and SDG 10. (c) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."

This paper aims to review the treatment technologies for the wastewater, compare the process technologies, discuss recent innovations, and propose future perspectives in the research area. The review observed that nanofiltration was the most effective membrane process for the treatment of the effluent (at >95% pollutant rejection). Other separation processes like adsorption and distillation had technical challenges of desorption, a poor fit for high pollutant load and cost limitations. Chemical treatment processes have varying levels of success but they are expensive and produce toxic sludge. Sludge production would be a hurdle when product recovery and reuse are targeted. It is difficult to make an outright choice of the best process for treating the effluent because each has its merits and demerits and an appropriate choice can be made when all factors are duly considered. The process intensification of the industrial-scale production of the bakers' yeast process will be a very direct approach, where the process optimisation, zero effluent discharge, and enhanced recovery of value-added product from the waste streams are important approaches that need to be taken into account."
238,Frequency of Thrombotic Risk Factors in Patients with Chronic Thromboembolic Pulmonary Hypertension and Acute Pulmonary Embolism: A Case-Control Study,"Mark W Dodson,Meghan M Cirulis,Haojia Li,Zhang Yue,Lynette M Brown,C Gregory Elliott,Mark W Dodson,Meghan M Cirulis,Haojia Li,Zhang Yue,Lynette M Brown,C Gregory Elliott","Chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH) is a serious complication of acute pulmonary embolism (PE) which remains underdiagnosed. A better understanding of risk factors for CTEPH would improve our ability to predict which PE survivors are at risk. Several medical conditions-including malignancy, splenectomy, thyroid hormone supplementation, the presence of an intravascular device, inflammatory bowel disease, osteomyelitis, and non-O blood group-have been associated with increased risk of CTEPH, primarily in studies comparing patients with CTEPH to individuals with non-thrombotic conditions. Because many of these conditions increase thrombosis risk, it remains unclear whether their association with CTEPH reflects a general effect on thrombosis risk, or a specific effect on the risk of developing CTEPH as an outcome of thrombosis. We performed a case-control study comparing the frequencies of these conditions in patients with CTEPH versus patients with acute PE who did not develop CTEPH. The conditions studied were equally frequent in the CTEPH and PE cohorts, although there was a trend towards an increased frequency of splenectomy and non-O blood group among the CTEPH cohort. Thus, other than the possible exceptions of splenectomy and non-O blood group, the investigated medical conditions do not appear likely to increase the risk of CTEPH as an outcome of acute PE, and thus are unlikely to be useful in predicting CTEPH risk among PE survivors."

240,Coordination of dual-function acquisition price and corporate social responsibility in a sustainable closed-loop supply chain,"Hosseini-Motlagh, Seyyed-Mahdi; Ebrahimi, Samira; Zirakpourdehkordi, Roza","In reverse supply chains, acquisition price strategy provided by manufacturers plays an essential role in collecting used products. On the other hand, owing to the fact that the acquisition price contributes to the improvement of the environmental sustainability, it can influence the purchasing behaviors of eco-friendly customers. Thus, acquisition price strategy not only can positively affect the amount of returned products but also can positively affect the market demand. This study integrates bilateral effects of the acquisition price to analyze the performance of a sustainable closed-loop supply chain (CLSC) by introducing a dual-function acquisition price. This paper also contributes to the sustainable CLSC literature by proposing an analytical coordination mechanism to coordinate the dual-function acquisition price as an environmental sustainability and corporate social responsibility (CSR) as a social sustainability. Motivated by a real case of dairy industry, the bilateral effects of the acquisition price on both reverse and forward channels are considered through its dual functionality. In the sustainable CLSC consisting of two competitive manufacturers and one retailer, the manufacturers compete with each other on the dual-function acquisition price offered to the customers. Moreover, to facilitate the collection process, the manufacturers encourage the retailer to do the collection process by offering him a credit time scheme. Besides the collection process, the retailer invests in the CSR as social sustainability to boost the market share. At first, we use a manufacturer-Stackelberg game to model the problem under decentralized structure where each member individually optimizes its own profitability. Afterward, the problem is formulated under centralized structure where the decision variables are determined from CLSC viewpoint. Then, a compensation-based wholesale price contract is developed to coordinate the competitive CLSC under coordinated model. Using the data of the case study, the results demonstrate that the proposed contract enhances the whole CLSC and all members' profitability, the manufacturers' dual-function acquisition price, and the retailer's CSR investment. Therefore, the developed contract can improve the performance of the competitive CLSC from environmental, social, and economic viewpoints. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."
241,Evaluation of shape factor impact on discharge coefficient of side orifices using boost simulation model with extreme learning machine data-driven,"Majeid Heydari,Saeid Shabanlou,Babak San Ahmadi,Majeid Heydari,Saeid Shabanlou,Babak San Ahmadi","In this paper, for the first time, the impact of the shape factor on the discharge coefficient of side orifices is evaluated using the novel Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) model. In addition, the Monte Carlo simulations (MCs) are applied to assess the accuracy of the modelling. Furthermore, the validation is conducted by means of the k-fold cross-validation approach (with k = 5). In other words, the most optimized number of hidden neurons is chosen to be equal to 30 and the results of all activation functions of the extreme learning machine are examined and the sigmoid activation function is selected for simulating the discharge coefficient. Subsequently, two modelling combinati0ons are introduced using the input parameters and five different extreme learning machine models are also developed. The analysis of the modelling results exhibits that the model with the shape factor is more accurate. The superior model is a function of all input parameters reasonably estimating the discharge coefficient. For example, the values of R and MAPE for this model are estimated to be 0.990 and 0.223, respectively. The results of the superior model are also compared with the empirical equations and it was shown that this model has higher accuracy."

In this work, we exploit ultraviolet photoacoustic microscopy for identifying human glioma xenograft of mouse brain ex vivo. Intrinsically excellent imaging contrast of cell nucleus at ultraviolet photoacoustic illumination along with good spatial resolution allows for discerning the brain glioma of freshly-harvested thick brain slices, which circumvents laborious time-consuming preparations of the tissue specimens including micrometer-thick slicing and H&E staining that are prerequisites in standard histology analysis. The identification of tumor margins and quantitative analysis of tumor areas is implemented, representing good agreement with the standard H&E-stained observations. Quantitative ultraviolet photoacoustic microscopy can access fast pathological assessment to the brain tissues, and thus potentially facilitates intraoperative brain tumor resection to precisely remove all cancerous cells and preserve healthy tissue for maintaining its essential function."
243,Outstanding Multi-Photon Absorption at π-Delocalizable Metallodendrimers,"Ling Zhang,Mahbod Morshedi,Mark G Humphrey,Ling Zhang,Mahbod Morshedi,Mark G Humphrey","Multi-photon absorption (MPA) has attracted interest for applications exploiting the tight spatial control of interaction volume and long wavelength excitation. However, a deficiency of molecules exhibiting higher-order nPA (n-photon absorption, n>2) and a lack of structure-property studies to define the key structural characteristics needed to optimize higher-order MPA performance have hindered practical development. We herein report the syntheses of second- and third-generation metallodendrimers and assessment of their nonlinear absorption, together with those of zero- and first-generation analogues. We report the first 5PA and 6PA data for an organometallic. The largest dendrimer exhibits exceptional three-, four-, five- and six-photon absorption to femtosecond-pulsed light. The systematically varied compounds highlight the crucial role of metal-to-oligo(phenyleneethynylene) charge transfer in promoting outstanding MPA activity."

The main objective may be divided into three direct aims, each of which consists of the determination of the factors that can influence the choice of tourist journeys: (1) organizational factors, (2) social-economic ones, and (3) sustainable development. The authors' own research findings are used to verify the objective. The research was conducted in April and May 2020 with the use of a diagnostic survey method and a questionnaire. Five-hundred sixty-four respondents from Poland (Podlaskie, Masovian, and Lesser Poland Voivodeships) and 133 respondents from the US (New York State, New Jersey, and Illinois) took part in the research. It was divided into organizational, social-economic, and sustainable development related factors. The research confirmed, inter alia, a great impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the organization of tourist travels by the respondents in 2020. The issue presented in the article is a new one; it has not yet been a subject matter of research. That is the major reason the authors aimed to conduct it. What is a new methodological element in the article is the organization of some concepts concerning tourism and a presentation of the influence of COVID-19 on tourism. In the authors' opinion, the issues presented are new and have a considerable impact on new trends in the development of tourism at the time of the COVID-19 pandemic. The issue discussed is very broad, and the article does not exhaust it. The research findings are compared to the research findings reported by other authors, and standard deviations are calculated."

Inorganic copper compounds and antibiotics are conventionally used to control BLB disease. They often cause environmental pollution, contributing to adverse effects on human health. Therefore, research is now leading to the search for alternative control methods. Tea tree oil (TTO) is obtained from a traditional medicinal plant, Melaleuca alternifolia, with antibacterial properties. In this study, we found that TTO showed antibacterial activity against Xoo with a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 18 mg/ml. These antagonistic activities were not limited only to planktonic cells, as further studies have shown that TTO effectively eradicated sessile cells of Xoo in both initial and mature biofilms. Furthermore, it was also observed that TTO reduced various key virulence properties of Xoo, such as swimming, swarming motility, and the production of extracellular polymeric substances, xanthomonadin, and exoenzymes. TTO triggered ROS generation with cell membrane damage as an antibacterial mode of action against Xoo. The in silico study revealed that 1,8-cineole of TTO was effectively bound to two essential proteins, phosphoglucomutase and peptide deformylase, responsible for the synthesis of EPS and bacterial survival, respectively. These antibacterial and anti-virulence activities of TTO against Xoo were further confirmed by an ex vivo virulence assay where TTO significantly reduced the lesion length caused by Xoo on rice leaves. All these data concluded that TTO could be a safe, environment-friendly alternative approach for the comprehensive management of BLB disease."
246,"Quantifying expansion and removal of Spartina alterniflora on Chongming island, China, using time series Landsat images during 1995-2018","Zhang, Xi; Xiao, Xiangming; Wang, Xinxin; Xu, Xiao; Chen, Bangqian; Wang, Jie; Ma, Jun; Bin Zhao; Li, Bo","The rampant encroachment of Spartina alterniflora into coastal wetlands of China over the past decades has adversely affected both coastal ecosystems and socio-economic systems. However, there are no annual or multi-year epoch maps of Spartina saltmarsh in China, which hinders our understanding and management of Spartina invasion. In this study, we selected Chongming island, China, where Spartina saltmarsh had expanded rapidly since its introduction in the 1990s. We investigated phenology of Spartina, Phragmites and Scirpus saltmarshes, and the time series vegetation indices derived from Landsat images showed that Spartina saltmarsh did not green-up in April-May and stayed green in December-January, which differed from the phenology of Phragmites and Scirpus saltmarshes. We developed a pixel- and phenology-based algorithm that used time series Landsat data to identify and map Spartina saltmarsh, and we applied it to quantify the temporal dynamics (expansion and removal) of Spartina saltmarsh on Chongming island during 1995-2018. The resultant maps showed that Spartina saltmarsh area on Chongming island increased from similar to 4 ha in 1995 to similar to 2067 ha in 2012 but dropped substantially to similar to 729 ha in 2016 after a large-scale ecological engineering project (US$ 186 million) was started to remove Spartina during 2013-2016. Chongming island still had similar to 1315 ha Spartina saltmarsh in 2018, and majority of it was distributed outside the Chongming Dongtan National Nature Reserve, which could serve as the sources for reinvasion in the near future. This study demonstrates the feasibility of using time series Landsat images, pixel- and phenology-based algorithm, and GEE platform to identify and map Spartina saltmarsh over years in the region, which is useful to the management of invasive plants in coastal wetlands."

Particulate and gaseous phase samples were collected in different short campaigns (2015, 2016, and 2017) near an urban-industrial area. Organic carbon (OC), elemental carbon (EC), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH), and its derivatives (nitro and oxy-PAH), n-alkanes, hopanes, and pesticides were determined. The Salmonella/microsome test confirmed the mutagenic activity of these samples. Among PAH, benzo(a)pyrene was detected as one of the most abundant compounds. Benzo(a)pyrene equivalent concentrations for PAH and nitro-PAH, and the associated risk of lung cancer, showed values above those recommended in the literature. The profile of n-alkanes confirmed the predominance of anthropogenic sources. Pesticide concentrations and estimated risks, such as the daily inhalation exposure and hazard quotient, suggest that exposure to these compounds in this area may be dangerous to human health."
248,Life cycle assessment of a small-scale methanol production system: A Power-to-Fuel strategy for biogas plants,"Eggemann, Lea; Escobar, Neus; Peters, Ralf; Burauel, Peter; Stolten, Detlef","Power-to-Fuel (PtF) systems use carbon dioxide and hydrogen as feedstock together for renewable fuel production and can hence contribute to climate change mitigation. This study assesses the environmental performance, from cradle to gate, of an innovative PtF system for synthetic methanol production, which integrates a biogas plant based on manure and straw residues as well as a combined heat and power unit. Under this concept, the residual carbon dioxide from biogas production is used for the synthesis of methanol, whereas hydrogen is obtained via wind-based electrolysis. A life cycle assessment (LCA) is carried out here for 1 kg of methanol produced with the integrated system proposed, operated on a small scale. In view of the multi-functionality of the process, the uncertainty in LCA outcomes is assessed by considering different assumptions on co-product credits for both the electricity from cogeneration and the digestate from the anaerobic digestion of organic raw materials. Additionally, a sensitivity analysis is performed to examine the influence of variability in life cycle inventory data on the results. All the analysed scenarios show significant improvements compared with conventional methanol production from fossil resources (with only a few exceptions for acidification and eutrophication). The sensitivity analysis shows that parameters determining the overall energy requirements as well as methane losses from anaerobic digestion in the PtF system greatly influence its environmental performance, and should be carefully considered in process design and upscaling. In spite of the uncertainty inherent in LCA, the system is presented as an interesting option to produce renewable methanol while contributing towards a circular economy, provided that the economic performance is also beneficial relative to the fossil alternative.

249,Change in cotton plant quality in response to application of anaerobically digested sewage sludge,"Mahmut Tepecik,Ali Rıza Ongun,Huseyin Husnu Kayikcioglu,Sezai Delibacak,Omer Lutfu Elmaci,Ahmet Esen Celen,Emre İlker,Mahmut Tepecik,Ali Rıza Ongun,Huseyin Husnu Kayikcioglu,Sezai Delibacak,Omer Lutfu Elmaci,Ahmet Esen Celen,Emre İlker","Treated municipal sewage sludge (TSS) was applied to the cotton plant at rates of 10, 20 and 30 t/ha per year. Seed cotton yield (71.4%), lint yield (67.7%) and cottonseed yield (74.1%) were increased significantly when sludge was applied at a rate of 30 t/ha (TSS3). The effects of TSS applications on seed yield, lint yield and cottonseed yield were listed as TSS3 > TSS2 > CF > TSS1 > C according to the applications. The increasing TSS levels had a positive effect and increased the total N concentration compared to the control. The highest N value was observed in TSS3 plots, while the lowest value was recorded in control (C) plots. The highest P value was found in control (C) at 0.80% and in 10 t/ha (TSS1) at 0.80%, while the lowest value was found in the TSS2 application (0.70%). The K concentration of cottonseed increased with the increasing TSS rates, from 1.56% in control plots to 2.20% in 20 t/ha application (TSS2). Corresponding to the TSS levels, the calcium of plant tissues was determined by a range of 0.12-0.13%. The treatments of TSS and mineral fertilizer had similar effects on the Mg content of cottonseed, which was in the range of 0.38-0.43%. Na content in plant tissue increased with increasing dose of sludge application compared to control soils. Increasing doses of TSS had no significant effect on the concentrations of iron (Fe), copper (Cu), zinc (Zn), manganese (Mn) and boron (B) in cottonseed. The order of the elements with respect to their amounts in cottonseed was as follows: Fe > Zn > Na > B > Mn > Cu. The concentrations of non-essential elements (Ni, Cd, Cr, Pb, Hg and As) in cottonseed were below the permissible limits."
250,Provincial perspective analysis on the coordination between urbanization growth and resource environment carrying capacity (RECC) in China,"Liao, Shiju; Wu, Ya; Wong, Siu Wai; Shen, Liyin","China has been implementing huge scale of urbanization in the past several decades and this will continue in the coming future years. Whilst the urbanization growth has presented good benefits to social and economic development in China, it has also brought severe challenges to the resource environment carrying capacity, such as air pollution, overloaded land resources. These challenges present differently in different provinces, which leads to the disparity in development between provinces. There has been growing concern whether the urbanization growth in different provinces is coordinated with resource environment carrying capacity (RECC), but this question has not been addressed in previous studies. This paper presents a critical analysis on the coordination between urbanization growth and resources environment carrying capacity (RECC) from provincial perspective in the context of China. A measurement of coordination degree (CD) is used to measure whether and to what extent that urbanization growth and RECC are coordinated by applying coupling coordination degree model (CCDM). The research data are collected from 30 provinces in China. The results suggest that the average coordination performance among the provinces experienced a steady growth during the period of 2005-2016, but there still exists big room for improvement towards well balanced coordination performance. From provincial perspective, the good performers are mainly economically developed provinces.

Report of six Cases and Review of the Literature,"Rongying Li,Karan Saluja,Mei Lin,Zhihong Hu,Zhenjian Cai,Hui Zhu,Rongying Li,Karan Saluja,Mei Lin,Zhihong Hu,Zhenjian Cai,Hui Zhu","Sinonasal hamartomas are uncommon lesions of nasal and sinus cavities. Based on indigenous cellular components and characteristic histologic features, they are further classified into four entities: respiratory epithelial adenomatoid hamartoma (REAH), seromucinous hamartoma (SH), chondro-osseous and respiratory epithelial hamartoma (CORE), and nasal chondromesenchymal hamartoma (NCH). REAH, SH, and CORE are seen in adult patients, while NCH predominantly occurs in newborns and infants. Morphologically REAH and SH are composed of respiratory epithelium and seromucinous glands, CORE is related to REAH but with additional feature of chondroid and/or osseous tissue, and NCH is composed of chondroid and stromal elements but devoid of epithelial component. All four lesions can present as sinonasal mass lesions and with associated obstructive symptoms. Given the rarity of these lesions, diagnosis can be challenging, especially in unusual clinical scenario. In this study, we report six cases of sinonasal hamartoma, including one case of NCH, one case of CORE, two cases of SH, and two cases of REAH. All cases were from adult patients including four men and two women. We also review the literature of the clinical and pathologic features of these rare lesions."

Routine screening of thyroid nodules in patients with hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism without risk factors for thyroid cancer is not recommended. Most thyroid nodules are benign. Sonographic risk-stratification systems should be used to estimate the risk of malignancy and the need for fine-needle aspiration biopsy. Malignant thyroid nodules require surgical management. Most thyroid cancers are well-differentiated papillary or follicular thyroid neoplasms, which have an excellent prognosis with a low mortality rate."

Upon data acquisition, one major hurdle is the subsequent interpretation and visualization of the datasets acquired. To address this challenge, VR-Cardiomics is presented, which is a novel data visualization system with interactive functionalities designed to help biologists interpret spatially resolved transcriptomic datasets. By implementing the system in two separate immersive environments, fish tank virtual reality (FTVR) and head-mounted display virtual reality (HMD-VR), biologists can interact with the data in novel ways not previously possible, such as visually exploring the gene expression patterns of an organ, and comparing genes based on their 3D expression profiles. Further, a biologist-driven use-case is presented, in which immersive environments facilitate biologists to explore and compare the heart expression profiles of different genes."
256,Wind energy utilization for hydrogen production in an underdeveloped country: An economic investigation,"Rezaei, Mostafa; Naghdi-Khozani, Nafiseh; Jafari, Niloofar","Since economic viability is among the main criteria for deciding whether to launch a project, therefore the aim of this study is to scrutinize economic aspects of harnessing wind energy in Afghanistan for producing hydrogen. In this regard, levelized cost of wind-generated electricity was first projected for all 34 capital cities. Then, energy efficiency of the hydrogen production system, Levelized Cost of Hydrogen (LCOH) and payback period of establishing wind farm were investigated for the city with the least Levelized Cost of Electricity (LCOE). As some unpredictable conditions may occur during lifetime of a wind power plant, causing decline in output energy of the turbines, thus 5 degradation rates were deemed to compute LCOE, LCOH, energy efficiency and payback period under 3 scenarios, which leaded to 15 different cases. The results showed that utilizing one set of ""WES 100 GENERAL"" wind turbine with rated power of 100 kW in Fayzabad could produce 260,610 kWh/yr of electricity when degradation rate constituted zero. Moreover, Fayzabad had LCOE of 0.063, 0.068 and 0.079 $/kWh and LCOH of 2.118, 2.158 and 2.261 $/kg for the scenarios 1, 2 and 3, respectively, when degradation rate was zero. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

257,Making the circular economy work for human development,"Schroder, Patrick; Lemille, Alexandre; Desmond, Peter","This paper aims to re-conceptualise and advance the existing frameworks and practical applications of the circular economy (CE) towards a broader approach to development in general and, more particularly, to combine it with the approach for Human Development (HD). The CE is an alternative to the current ""take, make, waste"" extractive industrial model and offers a practical solution to address global and local environmental challenges, such as resource depletion, marine plastic pollution, and for staying within planetary system boundaries. Although the CE and related concepts such as cradle to cradle provide a most promising alternative to the traditional linear economy model and its impacts on the planets eco-systems, some of the CE key elements have raised debate both in the academic community and among policy makers. One of the debates concerns the missing social or human dimensions of the CE. Likewise, the HD approach lacks considerations of environmental sustainability. Drawing on both academic and grey literature and the authorso research observations and professional experiences in the fields of promoting the CE and international development cooperation for HD, we attempt to develop an integrative conceptual framework of the CE and HD. This framework includes social-economic elements of the transformation from linear to circular economic models, combined with HD from the social sciences and development studies. We thereby complement the technological-material focused CE model that is primarily based on principles of industrial ecology and engineering. We utilize the existing 'circular humansphereo concept to articulate the incorporation of HD into the discussion of CE. By bringing in explicit links with HD, we pursue a double aim: First, to raise awareness and understanding among the CE research community of the missing human dimension in current CE discourse, and second, to familiarise the international development community with the approaches of CE. This will advance the options for adopting CE practices in international development programmes and for the process of implementing the social SDGs concerning HD such as SDG 1, 3, 4, 5, and 10. Finally, we hope that this CE and HD framework can contribute to the resolution of environmental and developmental issues."
258,Strategic interaction of environmental regulation and green productivity growth in China: Green innovation or pollution refuge?,"Peng, Xin","The strategic interaction of inter-regional environmental regulation is a typical feature of local government behavior in China, which can affect the green productivity growth in the local region through the Porter effect and the pollution refuge effect. Based on the panel data of 274 prefecture-level cities from 2005 to 2015 in China, this thesis constructs a comprehensive indicator of environmental regulation, accurately identifies the mode of China's inter-regional strategic interaction of environmental regulation and calculates the green total factor productivity, green technology efficiency and green technology progress in 274 cities. In addition, this thesis also conducts an empirical analysis on the effect of the strategic interaction of environmental regulation on the green productivity in China. The author of this thesis finds that: (1) the mode of strategic interaction of environmental regulation in China is complementary race to the top, that is, the local region will strengthen its environmental regulation, if the environmental regulations in its adjacent regions are strengthened; (2) the environmental regulation in the local region promotes the green productivity in China, while the weighted environmental regulation in the adjacent regions inhibits the green productivity. What's more, environmental regulations in economic-proximity regions have greater negative spatial spillover effects on green productivity in the local region, compared with those in geographic-proximity regions; (3) environmental regulation in the local region and its adjacent regions can affect the green productivity growth in China through the channels of green innovation and pollution transfer, that is, the Porter effect and pollution refuge effect coexist in China. They mean that in the process of China's regional environmental governance, it is necessary to reduce pollution transfer, and promote green innovation so as to achieve sustainable and high-quality economic development."
259,Dynamic simulation and techno-economic analysis of a concentrated solar power (CSP) plant hybridized with both thermal energy storage and natural gas,"Rashid, Khalid; Mohammadi, Kasra; Powell, Kody","The addition of thermal energy storage and natural gas as a complementary energy source improves the flexibility, reliability, and value of concentrated solar power (CSP) plants. Nevertheless, due to the transient nature of solar energy, transitions from solar-only mode and natural-gas mode to hybrid solar-natural gas mode is quite challenging, especially when the plant is equipped with thermal storage. Thus, it is important to develop proper dynamic modeling and control schemes to accurately simulate such transitions. The objective of this study is to address this subject by demonstrating a dynamic model with reliable control schemes for a highly integrated hybrid parabolic trough-natural gas plant equipped with thermal energy storage. The specific goal is to study the dynamics of adding thermal storage to the hybrid plant. It is found that the developed control schemes assist smooth transitions between different operational modes and effective utilization of thermal storage and natural gas to maintain steady power production and steam mass flow rates under different solar conditions. The results demonstrate that the integration of storage regulates power production by solar energy and natural gas during the day time. It also enables an increase in the solar fraction of the hybrid plant while it causes a small decrease in thermodynamic efficiency. The analysis shows that the hybrid plant with the storage has a substantially lower specific CO2 emission (0.320 tonne/MWh) than single natural gas plant (0.413 tonne/MWh) although it has a higher levelized cost of electricity ($86.32/MWh against $74.92/MWh). The hybrid plant with storage demonstrates a promising potential for reliable and clean production of electricity, although research and development should be conducted to lower its cost.

260,Health care expenditure and environmental pollution: a cross-country comparison across different income groups,"Apergis, Nicholas; Bhattacharya, Mita; Hadhri, Walid","This paper investigates the long-run dynamics between health care expenditure and environmental pollution across four global income groups. The analysis uses data from 178 countries, spanning the period 1995-2017. Panel estimations are employed with unobserved heterogeneity, temporal persistence, and cross-sectional dependence using a model with common correlated effects. The findings document that the health care expenditure is a necessity for all sub-groups. We established that a 1% increase in national income increased health expenditure by 7.2% in the full sample, and 9.3%, 8.6%, 6.8% and 2.9% for low, low-middle, upper-middle and high-income groups, respectively, while a 1% increase in CO2 emissions increased health expenditure by 2.5% in the full sample, and 2.9%, 1.2%, 2.3% and 2.6% across these four income groups. We recommend that coordinated approach is needed in setting policy goals both in energy and health sectors in mitigating the negative effects of pollution. Our findings indicate that low-carbon emissions and energy efficient health care services will significantly reduce future health care expenses."

With this study, we tried to fill the gap by figuring out the answer to the question of whether the relationships between financial development, trade openness, capital flows and the renewable energy consumption is symmetric or asymmetric by applying Panel Non-linear Autoregressive Distributed Lagged from 1990 to 2017. Non-linear estimation confirms the long-run asymmetric relationships between financial development, trade openness, capital flows, and renewable energy consumption in the case of all three subsamples namely, low-income countries, middle-income countries, and upper-middle-income panel. Furthermore, in the short-run, the asymmetric relationship also confirms except in Lower-income countries. We, furthermore, investigate the directional causality with System-GMM specification under the error correction model. Findings unveiled the long-run causality in particular when renewable energy consumption treated as a dependent variable in the equation. (c) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."

Despite extensive research and development efforts, the success rate of clinical pipelines has been very limited. However, microRNAs (miRs) have been proved to be of crucial importance in regulating intracellular pathways for various pathologic conditions including those of a neurodegenerative nature. There is ample evidence of altered levels of various miRs in clinical samples of Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease patients with potentially major clinical implications. In the current review, we aim to summarize the relevant literature on the role of miRs in the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD) as the two globally predominant neurodegenerative conditions."

Water, energy, and carbon play significant roles in regional sustainable development. It is critical to understand the Water-Energy-Carbon Emissions nexus, and this study explores the nexus using the Environmental Input-Output model. The embodied water and energy consumption and embodied carbon emissions are assessed. The water and energy consumption coefficients and CO2 emission coefficients are analysed. The main results are: (1) The Water-Energy-Carbon Emissions nexus characteristics of light industry, heavy industry, and service industry were similar: water-intensive, energy-intensive, and carbon-emission-intensive; (2) Agriculture consumed 64.38% of the national water supply; however, the water utilisation efficiency was only 32%; (3) Agriculture had much higher water consumption and direct water consumption coefficients. Light industry, service industry, and heavy industry were the top three sectors in terms of indirect water consumption coefficients; (4) Heavy industry, light industry, and service industry were the top three sectors with the highest indirect energy consumption coefficients and carbon emission coefficients. The consumption (water and energy) and CO2 emission coefficients can provide significant support for sustainable development strategies. This study provides a better understanding of the Water-Energy-Carbon Emissions nexus in China."

This biomechanical study aims to assess the risk of tendon rupture due to passage of Kirschner wires or hypodermic needles. Porcine extensor tendons were divided into four groups. Group 1: a control group was tested to ensure that repeated stress alone did not cause failure. Group 2a: 1.1-mm Kirschner wires were hand pushed through tendons 50 times and then stressed to 40 N, repeated until tendon failure. In Group 2b, K-wires were passed while rotating using a drill. Group 3: the experiment was repeated using a 20 G hypodermic needle. Group 2a tendons required a median of 2450 passes (1150-3500) to propagate failure, Group 2b a median of 2250 (1200-3850) and Group 3a median of 200 passes (150-450).

We have developed an arthroscopic transosseous foveal footprint repair technique, which maximizes the contact between the disrupted triangular fibrocartilage complex and its foveal footprint for better healing by using four sutures in a divergent configuration through a 1.6-mm bone tunnel. Twelve patients with triangular fibrocartilage complex foveal injuries who had undergone this repair technique were reviewed with a mean follow-up of 53 months. All patients achieved significant improvement in the modified Mayo wrist score and the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand score. All patients had stable distal radioulnar joints with comparable ranges of motion and grip strengths between the operated and contralateral wrists. There was no significant difference in functional score in those who were treated more than 6 months after injury.Level of evidence: IV."
266,Multiscale modeling of tumor response to vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibitor,"Melisa Hendrata,Janti Sudiono,Melisa Hendrata,Janti Sudiono","Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) has been known as a key mediator of angiogenesis in cancer. Bevacizumab is anti-VEGF monoclonal antibody that has been approved by the FDA as a first-line treatment in many types of cancer. In this paper, we extend a previously validated multiscale tumor model to comprehensively include the multiple roles of VEGF during the course of angiogenesis and its binding mechanism with bevacizumab. We use the model to simulate tumor system response under various bevacizumab concentrations, both in stand-alone treatment and in combination with chemotherapy. Our simulation indicates that periodic administration of bevacizumab with lower concentration can achieve greater efficacy than a single treatment with higher concentration. The simulation of the combined therapy also shows that the continuous administration of bevacizumab during the maintenance phase can lead to antitumor activity which further suppresses its growth. Agreement with experimental results indicates the potential of the model in predicting the efficacy of anti-VEGF therapies and could therefore contribute to developing prospective clinical trials."
267,A load-carrier perspective examination on the change of ecological environment carrying capacity during urbanization process in China,"Zhu, Mengcheng; Shen, Liyin; Tam, Vivian W. Y.; Liu, Zhi; Shu, Tianheng; Luo, Wenzhu","Urbanization has prompted a dramatic social and economic development during the past decades in China. As a long-term national strategy, urbanization can only be implemented effectively with sufficient and sustainable ecological environment resources. By appreciating that the ecological environment carrying capacity (EECC) is a yardstick for guiding the practice of sustainable urban development, it is therefore pressing to examine the change of EECC adequately, so that the sustainable urbanization can be addressed appropriately. This paper develops a new method from load-carrier perspective to explore the change of EECC performance in the rapid urbanizing China. The EECC performance on water, land, atmosphere and overall perspectives were measured for 30 provinces in China based on the established method. The results show that most provinces in China are experiencing an improving EECC performance during the urbanization process, particularly with an obvious progress in land dimension. In referring to the spatial difference of overall EECC performance, the gap between 30 provinces has been narrowing during surveyed years. However, few provinces including Chongqing, Shandong and Jiangxi have undergone a degradation in overall EECC performance. The EECC performance in atmosphere dimension is still considered as a challenge faced by most provinces, evidenced by high level of PM2.5 concentration. These research findings provide valuable references not only for Chinese governments to formulate effective policy instruments and strategy measures for improving ecological environmental carrying status, but also for researchers to further study in the ecological environment carrying capacity in the context of other countries.

268,"Performance assessment of a biomass-fuelled distributed hybrid energy system integrating molten carbonate fuel cell, externally fired gas turbine and supercritical carbon dioxide cycle","Roy, Dibyendu; Samanta, Samiran; Ghosh, Sudip","This article proposes an innovative distributed hybrid power system where the biomass gasification technology is integrated with the molten carbonate fuel cell, an externally fired gas turbine, and a supercritical carbon dioxide cycle. The thermodynamic, economic and environmental performances of the proposed system are extensively studied to show the impact of the main operational and design parameters. The proposed small capacity hybrid power system yields the highest energy efficiency of 40.88%, which is close to the efficiency level of the large-scale biomass gasification based combined cycle system. The maximum exergetic efficiency of the proposed power system is estimated to be around 34.07%. The biomass gasifier (31.79%) contributes the highest amount of exergy destruction, followed by the primary heat exchanger (15.97%), combustion chamber (14.01%) and the molten carbonate fuel cell (12.53%) unit. The sensitivity analysis reveals that the cost of electricity can reach up to 0.1057 $/kWh. A comparative performance analysis, among other biomass-fueled power generation systems suggests that the developed power system yields better techno-economic performance than the other previously proposed system configurations. The environmental analysis reveals that the proposed plant can reduce maximum up to 1510 ton of CO2/year, which yields an environmental benefit of 21,901 $/year, in comparison to a fossil fuel-based plant of similar capacity."

Aims were to measure gene expression of adipogenic (C/EBPα/β, PPARγ-1/2, SREBP-1c, LXRα), lipogenic (SCD1, DGAT-1/2), angiogenic (VEGFα, leptin), and fibrotic (LOX, COL6A3) factors in the round ligament (RL), omental (OM), and mesenteric (ME) fat depots and to evaluate their relationships with IR and inflammation markers in 48 women with severe obesity undergoing bariatric surgery. Gene expression was assessed by RT-qPCR, and plasma glucose and insulin (HOMA-IR calculated), PAI-1, IL-6, TNFα, adiponectin, and leptin levels were determined. C/EBPβ and PPARγ-1/2 mRNA levels were more expressed in the OM (0.001<p<0.05). ME showed the highest expression of C/EBPα, SREBP-1c, DGAT-2, and leptin and the lowest of SCD1, LXRα, VEGFα, and LOX (0.001<p<0.05). COL6A3 expression was higher in the ME and RL (p<0.001). COL6A3 expression was negatively associated with IR indices in the RL (0.01<p<0.05) and with fasting glycemia and HOMA-IR in the OM (0.001<p<0.05). VEGFα expression was positively related to TNFα and PAI-1 in the RL (0.001<p<0.05) and to PAI-1 in the OM (p<0.05) and negatively to PAI-1 in the ME (p<0.001). Fibrosis gene expression correlated negatively with inflammation in RL and OM (0.001<p<0.05) and positively with PAI-1 in the ME (0.001<p<0.05). The varying relationships of gene expression profiles with selected IR indices and inflammation biomarkers further suggest these fat depots have distinct contributions to overall health in premenopausal women with severe obesity."

This research examined the developmental trajectories of purpose exploration and commitment of Taiwanese youth during middle adolescence, with a focus on how they associate with youth's psychological functioning in terms of life satisfaction and depressive symptoms and whether social support moderates such development. A total of 369 vocational high school students in Taiwan (45% females; Mage = 15.82 years) participated in a four-wave study spanning two years with a one-semester interval. The results of piecewise growth curve modeling in the context of structural equation modeling suggested that purpose commitment increased over 10th grade, decreased initially in 11th grade, and then continued to increase. Purpose exploration similarly increased over 10th grade, but after the initial 11th grade dip remained stable. In addition to the higher initial levels, the steeper the rate of purpose exploration and commitment ascent and the slighter the rate of reduction predicted enhanced youth life satisfaction. The trajectory of purpose commitment also predicted reduced depressive symptoms, but such effects did not occur for purpose exploration. Moreover, multi-group analyses revealed that the more family, teacher, and peer support youth perceived, the more likely youth explored and committed to purpose over time."
271,"Mapping Annual Land Disturbance and Reclamation in a Surface Coal Mining Region Using Google Earth Engine and the LandTrendr Algorithm: A Case Study of the Shengli Coalfield in Inner Mongolia, China","Xiao, Wu; Deng, Xinyu; He, Tingting; Chen, Wenqi","The development and utilization of mining resources are basic requirements for social and economic development. Both open-pit mining and underground mining have impacts on land, ecology, and the environment. Of these, open-pit mining is considered to have the greatest impact due to the drastic changes wrought on the original landform and the disturbance to vegetation. As awareness of environmental protection has grown, land reclamation has been included in the mining process. In this study, we used the Shengli Coalfield in the eastern steppe region of Inner Mongolia to demonstrate a mining and reclamation monitoring process. We combined the Google Earth Engine platform with time series Landsat images and the LandTrendr algorithm to identify and monitor mining disturbances to grassland and land reclamation in open-pit mining areas of the coalfield between 2003 and 2019. Pixel-based trajectories were used to reconstruct the temporal evolution of vegetation, and sequential Landsat archive data were used to achieve accurate measures of disturbances to vegetation. The results show that: (1) the proposed method can be used to determine the years in which vegetation disturbance and recovery occurred with accuracies of 86.53% and 78.57%, respectively; (2) mining in the Shengli mining area resulted in the conversion of 89.98 km(2) of land from grassland, water, etc., to barren earth, and only 23.54 km(2) was reclaimed, for a reclamation rate of 26.16%; and (3) the method proposed in this paper can achieve fast, efficient identification of surface mining land disturbances and reclamation, and has the potential to be applied to other similar areas."
272,Assessing and predicting changes in ecosystem service values based on land use/cover change in the Bohai Rim coastal zone,"Liu, Yubin; Hou, Xiyong; Li, Xiaowei; Song, Baiyuan; Wang, Chao","Land use/cover change (LUCC) in the Bohai Rim coastal zone has accelerated as a result of rampant economic development, which has directly caused many negative effects on ecosystem functions and services. Based on multi-temporal land use data (2000, 2005, 2010 and 2015), the benefit transfer method was used to assess the ecosystem service value (ESV) of the Bohai Rim coastal zone, and the impact of LUCC on ecosystem services was studied. Multi-scenario simulations for 2025 were conducted using the future land use simulation model. The result of the analysis showed that during the period from 2000 to 2015, the total ESV lost was 22.09 billion yuan, representing a decrease of 3.80%. The spatial distribution of the ESV showed a certain regularity, with obvious characteristics of a land-sea gradient change. As the distance from the coastline increased, the ESV per unit area gradually declined. Compared with those in 2015, the total ESVs of the socio-economic development scenario and the business-as-usual scenario in 2025 showed a declining trend, while they increased under the ecological protection priority scenario. Under the ecological protection priority scenario, regulating services and support services increased significantly, but those declined dramatically under the socio-economic development scenario. The patterns of LUCC are the main reasons for the decrease in ESV. This research provides a theoretical basis and support for the development and utilization of coastal space and the improvement of ""ecologicaleconomic-social"" benefits; additionally, the results provide support for scientific decision-making services for the sustainable use of resources in the coastal zone and for the sustainable management of ecosystems."

Brillouin microscopy (BM) has recently emerged as one technique providing the 3D distribution of viscoelastic properties inside biological samples - so far relying on the implicit assumption that refractive index (RI) and density can be neglected. Here, we present a novel method (FOB microscopy) combining BM with optical diffraction tomography and epifluorescence imaging for explicitly measuring the Brillouin shift, RI, and absolute density with specificity to fluorescently labeled structures. We show that neglecting the RI and density might lead to erroneous conclusions. Investigating the nucleoplasm of wild-type HeLa cells, we find that it has lower density but higher longitudinal modulus than the cytoplasm. Thus, the longitudinal modulus is not merely sensitive to the water content of the sample - a postulate vividly discussed in the field. We demonstrate the further utility of FOB on various biological systems including adipocytes and intracellular membraneless compartments. FOB microscopy can provide unexpected scientific discoveries and shed quantitative light on processes such as phase separation and transition inside living cells."
274,The adoption of self-driving delivery robots in last mile logistics,"Cheng Chen,Emrah Demir,Yuan Huang,Rongzu Qiu,Cheng Chen,Emrah Demir,Yuan Huang,Rongzu Qiu","Covid-19, the global pandemic, has taught us the importance of contactless delivery service and robotic automation. Using self-driving delivery robots can provide flexibility for on-time deliveries and help better protect both driver and customers by minimizing contact. To this end, this paper introduces a new vehicle routing problem with time windows and delivery robots (VRPTWDR). With the help of delivery robots, considerable operational time savings can be achieved by dispatching robots to serve nearby customers while a driver is also serving a customer. We provide a mathematical model for the VRPTWDR and investigate the challenges and benefits of using delivery robots as assistants for city logistics. A two-stage matheurisitic algorithm is developed to solve medium scale VRPTWDR instances. Finally, results of computational experiments demonstrate the value of self-driving delivery robots in urban areas by highlighting operational limitations on route planning."

In this context, artificial intelligence is seen as one of the major enablers for Smart Logistics and Smart Production initiatives. This paper systematically analyzes the scientific literature on artificial intelligence, machine learning, and deep learning in the context of Smart Logistics management in industrial enterprises. Furthermore, based on the results of the systematic literature review, the authors present a conceptual framework, which provides fruitful implications based on recent research findings and insights to be used for directing and starting future research initiatives in the field of artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), and deep learning (DL) in Smart Logistics."
276,Fiber connectivity density mapping in end-stage renal disease patients: a preliminary study,"Chi Ma,Xinghai Jiang,Yande Ren,Gaojie Gu,Airong Fu,Chengjian Wang,Peirui Bai,Tong Zhou,Shanshan Qin,Shengli Fu,Chi Ma,Xinghai Jiang,Yande Ren,Gaojie Gu,Airong Fu,Chengjian Wang,Peirui Bai,Tong Zhou,Shanshan Qin,Shengli Fu","Abnormal brain structural connectivity of end-stage renal disease(ESRD) is associated with cognitive impairment. However, the characteristics of cortical structural connectivity have not been investigated in ESRD patients. Here, we study structural connectivity of the entire cerebral cortex using a fiber connectivity density(FiCD) mapping method derived from diffusion tensor imaging(DTI) data of 25 ESRD patients and 20 healthy controls, and between-group differences were compared in a vertexwise manner. We also investigated the associations between these abnormal cortical connectivities and the clinical variables using Pearson correlation analysis and multifactor linear regression analysis. Our results demonstrated that the mean global FiCD value was significantly decreased in ESRD patients. Notably, FiCD values were significantly changed(decreased or increased) in certain cortical regions, which mainly involved the bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortex(DLPFC), inferior parietal cortex, lateral temporal cortex and middle occipital cortex. In ESRD patients, we found a trend of negative correlation between the increased FiCD values of bilateral middle frontal gyrus and serum creatinine, urea, parathyroid hormone(PTH) levels and dialysis duration. Only the white matter hyperintensity(WMH) scores were significantly negatively correlated with the global FiCD value in multifactor regression analysis. Our results suggested that ESRD patients exhibited extensive impaired cortical structural connectivity, which was related to the severity of WMHs. A compensation mechanism of cortical structural recombination may play a role in how the brain adapts to maintain optimal network function. Additionally, the serum creatinine, urea and PTH levels may be risk factors for brain structural network decompensation in ESRD patients."
277,A new framework of industrialized construction in China: Towards on-site industrialization,"Li, Long; Li, Zhongfu; Li, Xiaodong; Zhang, Shengxi; Luo, Xiaowei","Many countries and regions consider industrialized construction to be a cleaner production method that facilitates sustainability in the construction industry. In China, proponents of industrialized construction have paid more attention to environmental and social sustainability, but the obstacles to economic sustainability have not been well solved. This study proposes a new industrialized construction method, OSI (On-site Industrialization). OSI combines the advantages of prefabrication and cast-in-situ. To develop and validate the OSI framework, this study conducts a two-phase action research. Based on the holistic overview of industrialized construction, the OSI framework was developed in action research phase 1. This framework includes five basic industrialized principles-standardization, prefabrication, modularization, lean, and sustainability. A multiple-case study was conducted in action research phase 2 to evaluate the sustainability performance of OSI from the perspective of triple-bottom-line (TBL), and the conventional precast concrete construction was used for benchmarking to validate the OSI framework. The findings indicate that OSI is a feasible industrialized construction method to balance the three dimensions of TBL in the Chinese construction industry. This research extends the theoretical knowledge body of industrialized construction while solving some practical problems in the construction industry. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."
278,"Cocaine trafficking from non-traditional ports: examining the cases of Argentina, Chile and Uruguay","Carolina Sampó,Valeska Troncoso,Carolina Sampó,Valeska Troncoso","This article presents the results of an exploratory study aimed to analyze the contexts in which the use of Non-Traditional ports of cocaine departure and counter-intuitive routes is prioritized, based on the experience of Argentina, Chile, and Uruguay. Moreover, we show that criminal organizations prioritize the Ports of Buenos Aires, San Antonio and Montevideo, and the counter-intuitive routes that lead to them, because they are spaces that generate incentives linked to the porosity of borders, the lack of control at the ports, and the possibility of exploiting the country's lack of reputation for drug exportation to re-export cocaine undetected. This study constitutes a precedent for future research on the role of South American Southern Cone ports in cocaine trafficking. We can identify at least four emerging lines of research: 1. Cocaine trafficking from landlocked countries; 2. The role of the waterway Paraná-Paraguay; 3. The link between Non-Traditional ports of cocaine departure and new markets; and 4. Other Non-Traditional Ports of cocaine departure, which are not containerized."

Research on vulture health is critical to conservation efforts including free-living vultures and captive breeding programs, but is limited to date. In this systematic review, we determined the reported causes of free-living vulture species morbidity and mortality worldwide. The most commonly reported cause of mortality was from toxins (60%), especially lead and pesticides, followed by traumatic injury (49%), including collisions with urban infrastructure and gunshot. Neglected areas of research in free-living vulture health include infectious diseases (16%), endocrine and nutritional disorders (6%), and neoplasia (< 1%). Almost half of the studies included in the review were conducted in either Spain or the USA, with a paucity of studies conducted in South America and sub-Saharan Africa. The highest number of studies was on Griffon (Gyps fulvus) (24%) and Egyptian vultures (Neophron percnopterus) (19%), while half of all vulture species had five or fewer studies. Future investigations on free-living vulture health should focus on neglected areas of research, such as infectious diseases, and areas with gaps in the current literature, such as South America, sub-Saharan Africa, and under-studied vulture species."
280,Vertical integration in the Australian community care setting: Can it work? A theoretical review of current literature,"Sarah Young,Kevin Swarts,Sarah J Prior,Douglass Doherty,Steven J Campbell,Sarah Young,Kevin Swarts,Sarah J Prior,Douglass Doherty,Steven J Campbell","Vertical integration (VI) is considered a strategic management plan whereby an organisation has ownership of its supply chain. It is utilised as a method for managing the economic needs and approaches of an organisation and ensuring that a product is readily available for use. From a healthcare perspective, this pertains to the coordination of services or levels of care and allows for adaptation to changing circumstances. This study reviews existing literature on VI in a healthcare setting to assess feasibility and effectiveness of this proposed solution. A theoretical literature review was performed utilising conceptual categorisation to understand how VI may benefit community care organisations, using the needs of a local organisation as an example. Seventeen articles were included from a range of databases and grey literature with findings categorised according to two research questions. The findings suggest that for VI to be effective and efficient it is important to consider the following themes: market failure, barriers to entry, productive capabilities and specific healthcare issues. In conclusion, from a management and economic perspective, when markets are not functioning efficiently and are in disequilibrium, VI may provide an appropriate avenue to address these problems, in particular for community care organisations."
281,The role of tourism development on CO2 emission reduction in an extended version of the environmental Kuznets curve: evidence from top 50 tourist destination countries,"Fethi, Sami; Senyucel, Elif","This study empirically investigates the role of tourism development in an extended version of the environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) for the top 50 tourist destination countries. Panel data on annual basis that range from 1996 to 2016 have been used by employing CADF, CIPS and PANKPSS unit root tests, DSUR cointegrating test as well as DH panel dynamic causality test. The results explain that tourism development exerts significant long-term effects on the extended version of EKC, whereas carbon emission levels significantly move over years through tourism development. Our findings also indicate that tourism development has positive effects on the level of CO2 emissions in the case of Turkey, Thailand, Russia, Greece, Saudi Arabia, Macao, Indonesia, Brazil, Dominica, Philippines, Bulgaria, Tunisia, Egypt, Iran, Georgia, Hong Kong, India and Malaysia. This result suggests that these countries should not use traditional fuel oil consumption methods, and such methods need to be abandoned for reduction in carbon dioxide in terms of environmental quality and sustainability."

283,Estimating individual mtDNA haplotypes in mixed DNA samples by combining MinION and MiSeq,"Hiroaki Nakanishi,Katsumi Yoneyama,Masaaki Hara,Aya Takada,Kentaro Sakai,Kazuyuki Saito,Hiroaki Nakanishi,Katsumi Yoneyama,Masaaki Hara,Aya Takada,Kentaro Sakai,Kazuyuki Saito","We tried to estimate individual mtDNA haplotypes in mixed DNA samples by combining MinION and MiSeq. The BAM files produced by MiSeq were viewed using Integrative Genomics Viewer (IGV) to verify mixed bases. By sorting the reads according to base type for each mixed base, partial haplotypes were determined. Then, the BAM files produced by MinKNOW were viewed using IGV. To determine haplotypes with IGV, only mixed bases determined by MiSeq were used as target bases. By sorting the reads according to base type for each target base, each contributor's haplotype was estimated. In mixed samples from two contributors, even a haplotype with a minor contribution of 5% could be distinguished from the haplotype of the major contributor. In mixed samples of three contributors (mixture ratios of 1:1:1 and 4:2:1), each haplotype could also be distinguished. Sequences of C-stretches were determined very inaccurately in the MinION analysis. Although the analysis method was simple, each haplotype was correctly detected in all mixed samples with two or three contributors in various mixture ratios by combining MinION and MiSeq. This should be useful for identifying contributors to mixed samples."
284,Day-ahead stochastic scheduling of integrated multi-energy system for flexibility synergy and uncertainty balancing,"Turk, Ana; Wu, Qiuwei; Zhang, Menglin; Ostergaard, Jacob","Secure operation of the power system is challenged by the high level of uncertainty and fluctuation introduced by renewable energy sources. More flexibility is needed to cope with the uncertainty and improve the utilization of renewable energy. A prominent solution to provide flexibility, and simultaneously increase the efficiency of the system, is the integration of different energy sectors. This paper proposes a two-stage stochastic scheduling scheme of an integrated multi-energy system, which considers the wind power uncertainty and the synergy of different energy sectors to achieve the optimal economic operation of the whole system with minimum curtailment of wind power. In the first stage, energy and reserve scheduling of generating units is performed, while accommodation of wind power production is realized through reserves in the second stage. In the proposed scheme, the electric power system, natural gas system, and district heating system are coordinated to achieve more flexibility, both in the day-ahead and real-time stage. The stochasticity of the wind power uncertainty is represented by realistic scenarios with corresponding probabilities, which are obtained from a scenario generation algorithm based on historical observations taking into account the temporal correlation of wind power. The simulation results on a small-scale test system show that both, the economic efficiency and wind power utilization, have been improved with more flexibility and more reliable scenario set. It is shown, that the total system cost is reduced and reserves are optimized. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."
285,"The role of plants in the formation of species-specific features in grass flies (Diptera, Chloropidae, Meromyza)","Tatiana A Triseleva,Varos G Petrosyan,Aleksandra A Yatsuk,Andrey F Safonkin,Tatiana A Triseleva,Varos G Petrosyan,Aleksandra A Yatsuk,Andrey F Safonkin","In the current manuscript, we present the results of comparative analysis of seven species of Meromyza flies in the ""variegata"" cluster and of the evolutionary close species M.inornata, based the following criteria: 1) 14 external key features; 2) shape and area of the anterior processes of postgonites; 3) mtDNA CO1 region and 4) host plant diversity data. We could demonstrate the primary role of host plants in species formation inside genus Meromyza and calculated the timing of the divergence of M.inornata and the species of ""variegata"" cluster. Based on our estimates of evolution rate for mtDNA CO1 gene, we could conclude that that divergence of herbs happened before the speciation of grass flies Meromyza. Meromyza species, close to the ancestral species of the cluster, are adapted to the wide range of host plants. We revealed the most informative variables h1, S and Plant analysing data with the following statistical methods: linear discriminant analysis - LDA, regularised discriminant analysis - RDA, flexible discriminant analysis - FDA and probabilistic neural network - PNN. The highest classification accuracy was achieved using PNN (99%) and the lowest when using LDA (95.8%). When the Plant trait was excluded, the classification accuracy decreased by 14%. We revealed the significant trends in size change of the anterior process of the postgonite amongst studies species. This morphological structure is an element of male reproductive apparatus critical for the restriction of interspecies mating. We determined three branches of speciation in the ""variegata"" cluster and five trends in the evolution of this cluster, based on the external morphological features. We showed that M.variegata and especially M.mosquensis, the species closest to the ancestral haplotype, have the largest number of features typical of those of M.inornata. Based on the external features and the area of the anterior process of the postgonite, we reconstructed the phylogenetic position of M.elbergi in the cluster. In accordance with the obtained outcomes, we could conclude that the distribution, species diversity and the adaptation of the grass flies to narrow oligophagy were directly connected to host plant diversity. The adaptation to different host plants could be the main factor in divergence of grass flies and their evolution started later than the diversification in the Pooideae subfamily of grasses."
286,Comparing the temporal dynamics and efficacy of task-relevant and task-irrelevant memory-driven attention,"Koeun Jung,Suk Won Han,Yoonki Min,Koeun Jung,Suk Won Han,Yoonki Min","People's attention is well attracted to a stimulus matching their memory. For example, when people are required to remember the color of a visual object, stimuli matching the memory color powerfully capture attention. Remarkably, stimuli with the shape of the memory object, that is, irrelevant-matching stimuli were also found to capture attention. Here, we examined how task relevance affects the temporal dynamics and the strength of memory-driven attention. In the experiment, participants performed a visual search task while maintaining the color or shape of a colored shape. When participants were required to memorize the color of the memory sample, the shape of the sample stimulus is task-irrelevant feature and vice versa. Importantly, while a search item matching working memory in the task-relevant dimension was presented for one group of participants, an irrelevant-matching search item appeared for the other group of participants. Further, we varied stimulus onset asynchrony (SOA) between the memory sample and search items. We found that relevant-matching stimuli captured attention regardless of whether the SOA was short or long. However, attentional capture by irrelevant-matching stimuli depended on the SOA; no memory-driven capture was observed at the shortest SOA, but significant capture was found at longer SOAs. Further, the capture effects by relevant-matching stimuli were greater than that of irrelevant-matching stimuli. These findings suggest both task-relevant and -irrelevant features in working memory affect the attentional selection in visual search task, but its temporal dynamics and strength are modulated by the task-relevance."

Further challenges arise in the decision making for CCU technology research, development, and deployment, in particular when allocating funding or time resources. No generally accepted techno-economic assessment (TEA) standard has evolved, and assessment studies often result in ""apples vs. oranges"" comparisons, a lack of transparency and a lack of comparability to other studies. A detailed guideline for systematic techno-economic (TEA) and life cycle assessment (LCA) for CCU technologies was developed; this paper shows a summarized version of the TEA guideline, which includes distinct and prioritized (shall and should) rules and which allows conducting TEA in parallel to LCA. The TEA guideline was developed in a co-operative and creative approach with roughly 50 international experts and is based on a systematic literature review as well as on existing best practices from TEA and LCA from the areas of industry, academia, and policy. To the best of our knowledge, this guideline is the first TEA framework with a focus on CCU technologies and the first that is designed to be conducted in parallel to LCA due to aligned vocabulary and assessment steps, systematically including technology maturity. Therefore, this work extends current literature, improving the design, implementation, and reporting approaches of TEA studies for CCU technologies. Overall, the application of this TEA guideline aims at improved comparability of TEA studies, leading to improved decision making and more efficient allocation of funds and time resources for the research, development, and deployment of CCU technologies."

During DN, the expression of glomerular glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1) increases, but the relationship between HG and GLUT1 is unclear. Glomerular mesangial cells (GMCs) have multiple roles in HG-induced DN. Here, we report prominent glomerular dysfunction, especially GMC abnormalities, in DN mice, which is closely related to GLUT1 alteration. In vivo studies have shown that BBR can alleviate pathological changes and abnormal renal function indicators of DN mice. In vitro, BBR (30, 60 and 90 μmol/L) not only increased the proportion of G1 phase cells but also reduced the proportion of S phase cells under HG conditions at different times. BBR (60 μmol/L) significantly reduced the expression of PI3K-p85, p-Akt, p-AS160, membrane-bound GLUT1 and cyclin D1, but had almost no effect on total protein. Furthermore, BBR significantly declined the glucose uptake and retarded cyclin D1-mediated GMC cell cycle arrest in the G1 phase. This study demonstrated that BBR can inhibit the development of DN, which may be due to BBR inhibiting the PI3K/Akt/AS160/GLUT1 signalling pathway to regulate HG-induced abnormal GMC proliferation and the cell cycle, supporting BBR as a potential therapeutic drug for DN."

Because of the small number of clinical cases and unclear biological characteristics, there is no uniform and standard treatment protocol. We herein describe the treatment of PMMFU using carbon ion radiotherapy. The radiotherapy was delivered at 60.8 Gy (RBE) in 16 fractions, once daily, five times per week. The patient achieved complete tumor disappearance within 1 year after carbon ion radiotherapy and remained disease-free thereafter. She developed acute grade 1 radiation dermatitis and urethritis, which resolved quickly; no other toxic effects were observed. At the time of this writing, her survival duration was 33 months. This case demonstrates that carbon ion radiotherapy may be a good option for primary genitourinary mucosal malignancies."

On the other hand, nearly one-third of children suffer from sleep disorders. However, all existing sleep staging methods are for adults. Therefore, we adapted edge AI to develop a lightweight automatic sleep staging method for children using single-channel EEG. The trained sleep staging model will be deployed to edge smart devices so that the sleep staging can be implemented on edge devices which will greatly save network resources and improving the performance and privacy of sleep staging application. Then the results and hypnogram will be uploaded to the cloud server for further analysis by the physicians to get sleep disease diagnosis reports and treatment opinions. We utilized 1D convolutional neural networks (1D-CNN) and long short term memory (LSTM) to build our sleep staging model, named CSleepNet. We tested the model on our childrens sleep (CS) dataset and sleep-EDFX dataset. For the CS dataset, we experimented with F4-M1 channel EEG using four different loss functions, and the logcosh performed best with overall accuracy of 83.06% and F1-score of 76.50%. We used Fpz-Cz and Pz-Oz channel EEG to train our model in Sleep-EDFX dataset, and achieved an accuracy of 86.41% without manual feature extraction. The experimental results show that our method has great potential. It not only plays an important role in sleep-related research, but also can be widely used in the classification of other time sequences physiological signals."

A small number of patients (5%) had a fracture that resulted in true shortening. Thirty-two per cent had fractures that appeared short, but lateral radiographs revealed that the articular surface was tilted, with either the anterior or dorsal rim of the articular surface being proximal to the distal ulna but the other rim was distal to it. We recommend initial assessment of variance on lateral radiographs. If the anterior and dorsal rims of the distal radial articular surface are proximal to the distal ulna, then true shortening is present and lengthening and stabilization, to hold the radius distracted, should be considered. If only one rim is proximal to the distal ulna, then correction of the tilt will lessen the apparent positive variance.Level of evidence: IV."
293,Performance analysis of typical linear augmented observers for a class of MIMO systems with nonlinear uncertainty,"Sen Chen,Wenyan Bai,Sen Chen,Wenyan Bai","To estimate the states and the uncertainties for multi-input-multi-output (MIMO) systems is significant in control engineering. The paper investigates the estimating performance of a widely-used linear augmented observer (LAO) by quantitatively analyzing the biased term of estimation error, which generalizes the previous studies. Then the necessary and sufficient condition for unbiased estimation of LAO is thoroughly discussed. More importantly, by investigating the observability of MIMO uncertain systems, the paper proves that the estimation of LAO is unbiased if and only if the states and the uncertainties of MIMO uncertain systems are observable. The presented theoretical analysis can help practitioners evaluate the feasibility of estimating the specific uncertainties via LAO in practical systems. Finally, even if the estimation of LAO is biased, the design procedure of extended state observer is presented, which offers the unbiased estimation of total disturbance and the derivatives of output."

Herein, based on an in-depth understanding of the degradation mechanism for the PSCs, a solvent-free and low-temperature melting encapsulation technique, by employing low-cost paraffin as the encapsulant that is compatible with perovskite absorbers, is demonstrated. The encapsulation strategy enables the full encapsulating operations to be undertaken under an ambient environment. It is found that the strategy not only removes residual oxygen and moisture to prevent the perovskite from phase segregation, but also suppresses the species volatilization to impede absorber decomposition, enabling a PSC devices with good thermal and moisture stability. As a result, the as-encapsulated PSCs achieve a 1000 h operational lifetime for the encapsulated device at continuous maximum power point output under an ambient environment. This work paves the way for scalable and robust encapsulation strategy feasible to hybrid perovskite optoelectronics in an economic manner."

A systematic review of the literature of the last 10 years gave 586 results with ""incidence,"" and 387 results with ""epidemiology,"" of which 39 papers were analyzed. The review results were discussed and voted in 2 consensus meetings of the WFNS (World Federation of Neurosurgical Societies) Spine Committee. Out of 39 studies, 15 studies have focused on thoracolumbar trauma, remaining 24 studies have looked at all spine trauma. Most were retrospective in nature; few were prospective and multicenter. Some studies have focused on specific injuries. The annual incidence of TL fractures is about 30/100,000 inhabitants including osteoporotic fractures. There is a trend to increase the fractures in elderly population especially in developed countries, while an increase of motor vehicle accidents in developing countries. The mortality rate among male elderly patients is relatively high. The incidence of thoracolumbar spine fractures is increasing because of low-velocity falls in the elderly population. The main reasons are falls and traffic accidents. Learning the regional differences and some special forms of trauma such as extreme sports, war, and gunshot injuries will help the prevention of the thoracolumbar spine fractures."
296,Feasibility study of on/off grid large-scale PV/WT/WEC hybrid energy system in coastal cities: A case-based research,"Jahangir, Mohammad Hossein; Fakouriyan, Samaneh; Rad, Mohammad Amin Vaziri; Renewable, Hassan Dehghan","In this study, according to the potential of available renewable resources in coastal areas, a hybrid system is proposed. The generalizability of the results of this study to other areas with different economic conditions and potential of energy resources is estimated through sensitivity analysis. Besides, the effect of the wave energy converter on the hybrid system is evaluated as a novel approach in sustainable power generation. Furthermore, it is attempted to measure the optimal distance from the power grid for economic development of stand-alone systems. The results demonstrate that the grid-connected system with 0.093-0.139 $/kWh cost of energy is more cost-effective compared to off-grid system with 0.136-0.182 $/kWh for large-scale demand. Employing wave energy converter not only leads to a more uniform power generation profile, but also reduces the need for batteries in hybrid energy system. However, using this device in areas with lower wave potential can significantly increase the expenses. Also the results reveal that the breakeven distance is reduced from about 300 km to less than 40 km by decreasing the demand from 20 MW to 1 MW. Moreover, it is concluded that rising the grid tariffs can be an effective policy to improve the renewables economic efficiency. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."
297,Exploring carbon emissions and international inequality in a globalized world: A multiregional-multisectoral perspective,"Bolea, Lucia; Duarte, Rosa; Sanchez-Choliz, Julio","The phenomenon of economic convergence has been investigated from different perspectives, aiming to analyze whether economies move towards a common growth path or tend to diverge over time, and the consequences of this for economic cohesion. However, these consequences for the evolution of CO2 emissions in the study of global convergence of CO2 emissions, and the implications in terms of pollution, inequality, and income-dependence have received less attention in the literature of convergence. The increasing globalization of economies and the rising fragmentation of supply chains imply many countries involved in the production chains and, in consequence, a vision is needed of worldwide emissions associated with these processes. In this paper, we use the multisectoral and multiregional perspective provided by a multiregional input-output model (MRIO), and the associated databases, to analyze the evolution of inequality in CO2 emissions, paying attention to the roles played by regional specificities and/or productive structures. MRIO models and indicators presented, provide the basis to assess to what extent countries and/or sectors are walking towards a common path or, on the contrary, tend to be more unequal over time. Given the role that structure, final demands and international trade play in these models, we can offer a novel structural view of the convergence issue. Moreover, MRIO models also allow analyzing this question combining the perspectives of production and consumption, and their relationship through international trade. Moreover, our paper attempts to shed light on the discussion about the global and regional process of generation of emissions, paying special attention to cluster analysis and to the existence of common trends by groups of countries. Empirically, the information provided by the most recent edition of the World Input-Output Database (WIOD) and environmental accounts compatible with this database, is used. In our view, the results contribute new dimensions and insights to the issue of international inequality in terms of environmental pressures and opens new debates on the relocation of environmental damage, comparative advantage, and the environmental footprint."
298,[The wave train of COVID-19 infections],"Maria Teresa Giraudo,Manuele Falcone,Cesare Cislaghi,Maria Teresa Giraudo,Manuele Falcone,Cesare Cislaghi","The present work studies the epidemic curve of COVID-19 in Italy between September 2020 and mid-June 2021 in terms of poussées, that is successive waves. There is obviously only one pandemic, although the virus has spread in the form of several variants, but the daily incidence trend can also be read in terms of overlapping of events that are different from each other or, in any case, induced by various phenomena. It can be hypothesized that in this way a succession of various waves was generated, which are modelled here using appropriate adaptation curves used in the study of epidemic data. Each curve corresponds approximately to the situation that would have occurred if no element had intervened to prevent the decrease of infections after the relative peak, while their overlap is considered to describe the subsequent increases. This interpolation has no predictive purpose, being purely descriptive over the time window under consideration. The discrepancies between the superposition of the modelling curves and the real epidemic curve are therefore also highlighted, especially in the transition periods between the various poussées. Finally, the analysis carried out allows to match the trend of the epidemic in the period considered with, on one hand, the series of events and, on the other, with the containment measures adopted which may have determined the succession of increases and decreases in the incidence of infections."
299,Lithium-ion battery 2nd life used as a stationary energy storage system: Ageing and economic analysis in two real cases,"Rallo, H.; Casals, L. Canals; De La Torre, D.; Reinhardt, R.; Marchante, C.; Amante, B.","Electric vehicles (EVs) are considered a viable alternative to internal combustion engine vehicles (ICEVs) and as a result of recent advances in battery technologies, sales are increasing year by year. However, recycling these batteries at the end of their useful life in the car can be a problem because they contain materials that can harm human health and the environment. Thus, car manufacturers consider that when those batteries have finished their first life in an EV, they still contain enough energy and capacity to be used in a stationary energy storage systems (SESSs), significantly contributing towards an increased sustainable transport sector in the future. This study focuses the analysis on the viability of a SESS installation, considering battery ageing from an economic perspective in two different real scenarios in Spain. This study simulates the electricity bill cost with and without SESS and calculates the annual savings accordingly. Following, the return on investment (ROI) of installing a SESS is calculated. Afterwards the lifetime of the batteries is calculated in order to compare it with the ROI and to decide if the installation of a SESS is advisable from an economic point of view. Major results indicate that any feasibility study of installing a SESS must be studied from an economic and battery ageing point of view. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."
300,A framework to overcome sustainable supply chain challenges through solution measures of industry 4.0 and circular economy: An automotive case,"Yadav, Gunjan; Luthra, Sunil; Jakhar, Suresh Kumar; Mangla, Sachin Kumar; Rai, Dhiraj P.","Adoption of sustainability has become extremely essential aspect over the last decade for the industries to sustain in the global market. However, the adoption of sustainability in supply chain is more concern for the manufacturing organisations. Constantly, changing market has insisted these organisations to revisit their supply chain activities in order to penetrate sustainability effectively through various practices such as lean, green, circular, and industry 4.0 etc. But, the lack of verified Sustainable Supply Chain Management (SSCM) frameworks has become a concern for the practitioners. Similarly, solutions required to overcome the SSCM adoption issues also need to be updated accordingly to changing business environments. So, the present study aims to develop a framework to overcome SSCM challenges through industry 4.0 and circular economy based solution measures. This study identifies a unique set of 28 SSCM challenges and 22 solution measures. Further, an automotive case organisation is used to test the applicability of the developed framework through hybrid Best Worst Method (BWM)- ELimination and Choice Expressing REality (ELECTRE) approach. The inputs for BWM-ELECTRE approach is obtained by constructing an expert panel within the case organisation. Initial inputs are taken for BWM comparisons to compute the weight of SSCM challenges; whereas, further a comparison of challenges and solution measures is also obtained for ELECTRE approach to compute the final ranking of the solution measures to overcome SSCM challenges. The case findings reveal that managerial and organisational challenges and economic challenges emerge as most critical to SSCM adoption. The present study outcomes will be beneficial for researchers working in SSCM industry 4.0 and circular economy domain; whereas, the practitioners can use the prioritised solution measures to formulate effective strategies to overcome SSCM adoption failures.

Samples of 27 T. inunguis specimens, maintained in the collection of the Amazonian Center for the Research and Preservation of Aquatic Mammals, were used, situated in an area highly impacted by gold mining in the northern region of the Brazilian Amazon. Samples of aquatic plants used as food by the animals were also analyzed. The elements S, Cl, K, Cr, and Mn accumulated mainly in the musculature, while Fe and Cu were more concentrated in the liver. Trace elements, such as rubidium (Rb) and rhodium (Rh), not previously reported in the organs of animals of the family Trichechidae, were also identified. The averages for T-Hg in the skin, muscle, encephalon, liver, kidney, and lung samples were, respectively, 0.1540 ± 0.1332, 0.0593 ± 0.1044, 0.0517 ± 0.0467, 0.0486 ± 0.0543, 0.0237 ± 0.0336, and 0.0013 ± 0.0032 µg.g-1. The values obtained for the vibrissae samples were below the limit of quantification, which allows for the conclusion that this tissue cannot be used as a contamination marker. It was observed that even when kept in a conservation breeding site, these animals were exposed to non-essential trace elements. Differences in the accumulation of elements were observed between the different organs and tissues analyzed. The presence of contaminants in animals that live in a preservation center, even at low levels, deserves attention."

In response to CO2 emissions reduction in China, this study integrated the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program's Operational Linescan System (DMSP-OLS) stable nighttime light (SNL) data and Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (NPP) Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) composite data, and established the integrated nighttime light datasets from 1992 to 2016. The estimated CO2 emissions model utilizing the integrated nighttime light datasets and statistical CO2 emissions at the provincial level from 1995 to 2016 were established. Finally, spatiotemporal dynamics of CO2 emissions were simulated from multiscale. The results clearly showed that: (1) The fitting results of regression relationship between DMSP-OLS SNL data and NPP-VIIRS composite data met the accuracy requirements. The CO2 emissions estimated model was valid. (2) The total amount of energy consumption CO2 emissions in China had increased from 1889.3340 Mt in 1995 to 4683.3165 Mt in 2016, with a total growth of 2.47 times. (3) The high CO2 emissions regions were clearly agglomerated in eastern coastal China from the pixel scale, the highest CO2 emissions provinces were concentrated in Hebei and Shandong, the high CO2 emissions prefecture cities were concentrated in Around Bohai Gulf area, eastern coastal China and some developed cities, and the high CO2 emissions counties were concentrated in eastern coastal China and western energy intensive counties. (4) The relatively-slow growth accounted for the highest proportion among the five growth types, and the CO2 emissions rapid growth regions were concentrated in eastern China at provincial, prefectural and county scale. The western regions accounted for the largest area proportion in five growth types at prefectural scale. We provided policy implications based on the results, which was beneficial to propose mitigation CO2 emissions reduction in China. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."
303,"Energy, exergy, and economic analyses of an innovative energy storage system; liquid air energy storage (LAES) combined with high-temperature thermal energy storage (HTES)","Nabat, Mohammad Hossein; Zeynalian, Mirhadi; Razmi, Amir Reza; Arabkoohsar, Ahmad; Soltani, M.","Liquid air energy storage is one of the most recent technologies introduced for grid-scale energy storage. As the title implies, this technology offers energy storage through an air liquefaction process. High energy storage density, no geographical limitation, and applicability for large-scale uses are some of the advantages of this technology. To improve the performance and environmental friendliness of the conventional design of this technology, a novel liquid air energy system combined with high-temperature thermal energy storage, thermoelectric generator, and organic Rankine cycle is proposed in the present article. The thermal energy storage unit removes the need for the conventional combustion chamber and thereby reduces greenhouse gas emission. The organic Rankine cycle and the thermoelectric generator recover the generated heat of the system during the charging process to further improve the efficiency of the system. During peak demand periods, around 9.6 MW power and 2.5 kg/s domestic hot water could be generated at round trip energy and exergy efficiencies of 61.13% and 52.84%, improving by 6.59% and 3.28% in comparison to the stand-alone design of this technology. The results indicate that the reference system operates with an air storage energy density and an occupied space energy density of 839 and 104 MJ/m(3). The economic analysis represents a payback period of 3.91 years and a net profit of about 18.6 $M during the useful lifetime of the system."

The infection has affected millions of people worldwide and caused morbidity as well mortality in patients with pre-existing chronic conditions such as metabolic, respiratory and cardiovascular disorders. The severity of the disease is mostly seen in people with low immunity and chronic sufferers of respiratory, cardiovascular and metabolic disorders. To date, there is no specific treatment available for COVID-19. Precaution and prevention are the most recommended options followed for controlling the spread of infection. Trace elements such as zinc, calcium, iron and magnesium play an important role in boosting the immunity of the host system. These components assist in the development and functioning of lymphocytes, cytokines, free radicals, inflammatory mediators and endothelial functioning. This review summarizes the common dietary supplements that are regularly consumed in Saudi Arabia and are known to contain these vital trace elements. Data available in Google Scholar, NCBI, PUBMED, EMBASE and Web of Science about COVID-19, micronutrients, trace elements and nutritional supplements of Saudi Arabia was collected. By highlighting the traditionally used dietary components containing the essential elements, this review could provide useful knowledge crucial for building immunity in the population."
305,"Passive and active performance assessment of building integrated hybrid solar photovoltaic/thermal collector prototypes: Energy, comfort, and economic analyses","Barone, Giovanni; Buonomano, Annamaria; Forzano, Cesare; Giuzio, Giovanni Francesco; Palombo, Adolfo","Solar systems represent a viable way to reduce in a sustainable manner building energy consumptions. Nevertheless, two issues can be underlined: insufficient building surface areas for hosting typical standalone solar devices and related high initial costs. Consequently, growing research and industrial interest in cost-effective building-integrated solar systems is today observed. In this framework, this paper presents a comprehensive analysis of two low-cost building-integrated hybrid photovoltaic/thermal collector prototypes (waterand air-cooled, respectively). Both active and passive effects are investigated employing a purposely developed dynamic simulation tool, able to carry out complete system performance analyses. The capability of such the proposed innovative devices as well as of the presented inhouse code is shown by a novel case study regarding a dwelling unit located into a multi-story residential building for three diverse European weather zones. Here, the investigated prototypes are modelled as integrated into the building South facade. For comparison purposes, a building integrated photovoltaic panel is also modelled as a reference case. Both active and passive effects are assessed. Relevant energy savings (up to 4236 kWhe/y), comfort outcomes (related hours variation range from-190 to thorn 121), and economic results (paybacks are between 3 and 6 years) are achieved.

306,"Energy investment, economic growth and carbon emissions in China-Empirical analysis based on spatial Durbin model","Li, Jinying; Li, Sisi","The international community has reached a consensus on preventing the global climate from deterioration by stabilizing greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere. Energy industry is a key field for greenhouse gas emission, and investment in the energy industry plays a crucial part in promoting the low-carbon development of China's energy industry. Energy investment can effectively break the high carbon ""lock-in effect"" of energy industry and achieve the low-carbon development of energy industry by guiding, regulating and gathering social funds into the field of cleaner production and the field of low-carbon technology. Based on the unified framework of energy, economy and environment, this article takes 30 provinces in China as the research object, and constructs a spatial econometric model to investigate the impact of energy investment and economic growth on carbon emission reduction. The results indicate that both energy investment and economic growth are responsible for the increase of China's provincial CO2 emissions, but their driving mechanisms are significantly different. Furthermore, the increase of carbon emissions in adjacent provinces will bring about the increase of local carbon emissions through spatial spillover effects. Based on these findings, the corresponding countermeasures and policy suggestions are put forward."
307,How does urbanization affect carbon emission efficiency? Evidence from China,"Sun, Wei; Huang, Chenchen","The complex impact of urbanization and the enormous pressure to reduce carbon emissions are two major challenges facing China. However, few studies have considered how urbanization affects carbon emission efficiency. To explore the impact of urbanization on carbon emission efficiency, this study evaluates the carbon emission efficiency based on the panel data of 30 provinces in China from 2000 to 2016. The correlations between six factors, including the level of urbanization, and carbon efficiency were analyzed by using a stochastic frontier model that combines with the translog production function. The results suggest that, first, despite the steady improvement in China's carbon efficiency, the average carbon efficiency is 0.5730 in 2016, with room for improvement of 42.70%. Second, there is an inverted U-shaped relationship between urbanization and carbon emission efficiency. The coefficient of the urbanization level is -0.6370, and the coefficient of its square is 1.2310. In the early stage, the expansion of the scope of urbanization promotes the improvement of carbon emission efficiency. Once the urbanization level passes the critical point, the economic growth rate will lag behind the growth rate of carbon emissions. Third, economic development level, energy consumption structure, foreign trade, and government intervention are positively correlated with carbon emission efficiency. Industrial structure inhibits the improvement of carbon emission efficiency. The conclusion provides a theoretical reference for urban planning and the green economy for government policymakers.

Its outbreak is leading to severe global socioeconomic disruptions impacting on all economic sectors from tourism, industry and the tertiary sector, up to the operational and opening of public offices, the closure of schools and the organization of families. Measures adopted by the Italian government to deal with the COVID-19 emergency have had direct effects both on people's daily lives and on the activity of most industrial and commercial production companies. These changes have been unequivocally reflected also on the Italian electricity system, which has shown unprecedented behavior in terms of both energy consumption and volume-and subsequently, in the observed share of renewable and conventional production technologies. The goal of this study is to show the impact on the power industry of all the restrictions and lockdown of the activities in Italy and to discuss the effects of COVID-19 outbreak on the bulk power system and the entire electricity sector. In particular, the consequences on load profiles, electricity consumption and market prices in Italy, including the environmental aspects, are examined."

Polymer-based nanomedicines are presently used to enhance the treatment effectiveness and decrease the systemic toxicity of chemotherapeutic agents. However, the disadvantage of currently polymeric carriers is without therapy procedure. Herein, for the first time, glutathione (GSH)-responsive polymer (PRES) with anti-cancer effect was synthesized following the condensation-polymerization method using resveratrol (RES) and 3,3'-dithiodipropionic acid. PRES can not only suppress the tumor cells growth but can also self-assemble into nanoparticles (∼93 nm) for delivering antitumor drugs, such as paclitaxel (PTX@PRES NPs). The system could achieve high drug loading (∼7%) and overcome multidrug resistance (MDR). The results from the in vitro studies revealed that the NPs formed of PRES were stable in the systemic circulation, while could be efficiently degraded in tumor cells high GSH environment. Results from cytotoxicity tests confirmed that PTX@PRES NPs could effectively suppress the growth of cancer cells (A549) and drug-resistant cells (A549/PTX). The NPs could also be used to significantly increase the therapeutic efficacy of the drugs in A549/PTX tumor-bearing mice. In vivo investigations also demonstrated that the PRES-based NPs exhibited tumor inhibition effects. In summary, we report that the GSH-responsive polymer synthesized by us exhibited multiple interesting functions and could be used for effective drug delivery. The polymer exhibited good therapeutic effects and could be used to overcome MDR. Thus, the synthesized system can be used to develop a new strategy for treating cancer."

Nevertheless, the disadvantages, including large volume variation and poor electrical conductivity, obstruct these materials to meet the needs of practical application. Well-designed mesoporous nanostructures and electronic structure modulation can enhance the electron/Li-ions diffusion kinetics. Herein, a unique mesoporous molybdenum dioxide/molybdenum phosphide heterostructure nanobelts (meso-MoO2 /MoP-NBs) composed of uniform nanoparticles is obtained by one-step phosphorization process. The Mott-Schottky tests and density functional theory calculations demonstrated that meso-MoO2 /MoP-NBs possesses superior electronic conductivity. The detailed lithium storage mechanism (solid solution reaction for MoP and partial conversion for MoO2 ), small change ratio of crystal structure and fast electronic/ionic diffusion behavior of meso-MoO2 /MoP-NBs are systematically investigated by operando X-ray diffraction, ex situ transmission electron microscopy, and kinetic analysis. Benefiting from the synergistic effects, the meso-MoO2 /MoP-NBs displays a remarkable cycling performance (515 mAh g-1 after 1000 cycles at 1 A g-1 ) and excellent rate capability (291 mAh g-1 at 8 A g-1 ). These findings can shed light on the behavior of the electron/ion regulation in heterostructures and provide a potential route to develop high-performance lithium-ion storage materials."

Although transition metal sulfides have been deemed as efficient NRR electrocatalysts, it remains a great challenge to suppress the serious HER to achieve high Faradaic efficiency (FE). Herein, vanadium disulfide (VS2 ) is deliberately designed by partially shearing its sulfur (S) edges through a simple calcination treatment at 350 °C. The as-prepared VS2 -350 electrocatalyst exhibits a highest NH3 yield of 20.29 µg h-1 mgcat-1 with a promising FE of 3.86%, which is significantly higher than the counterpart of untreated VS2 (VNH3 : 15.92 µg h-1 mgcat-1 , FE: 1.69%). Experimental and computational results reveal that shearing the S edges can substantially inhibit the HER and expose more V atoms as active sites. Meanwhile, the mechanistic analysis shows that the N2 activation at V active sites follows an ""acceptance-donation"" mechanism, while the N2 conversion to NH3 follows a hybrid 2 pathway at the VS2 -350 electrocatalyst. This work provides a simple strategy of designing high-performance NRR electrocatalysts based on a deep understanding of the atomic sites dependent catalytical activity."
314,Untapped renewable energy potential of crop residues in Pakistan: Challenges and future directions,"Kashif, M.; Awan, M. B.; Nawaz, S.; Amjad, M.; Talib, B.; Farooq, M.; Nizami, A. S.; Rehan, M.","Sustainability in power generation mainly depends on the transition from fossils to sustainable energy resources. Biomass from the crop residue has huge potential for renewable power generation, but it is still not utilized to its full potential. This study presents a comprehensive methodology to evaluate and forecast the current and future availability of selective crop residue to generate renewable energy. A forecast model incorporating historical trends in the crop yield has been developed in MATLAB and implemented for crop residue based biomass resource assessment of five primary crops (wheat straw, rice husk, rice straw, cotton straw, corn stover, and bagasse) in order to estimate the energy generation potential for Pakistan from 2018 till 2035. It was found that about 40 million tonnes of crop residue was available in Pakistan for power generation in the year 2018 considering a residue removal (availability) factor of 50%. This translates to an estimated potential of about 11,000 MW of electricity generation capacity using crop residue derived biomass for 2018. This capacity is predicted to gradually increase up to 16,000 MW by the year 2035 based on the trends in the growth of crop production since 2001. The suitability of a potential region for the installation of 100 MW biomass-fired power plants was also assessed by calculating crop residue density and an equivalent collection radius (R-e) of 50 km (km). Punjab province of Pakistan, being an agricultural province, with relatively better road infrastructure can sustain crop residue based power plants of up to 7000 MW cumulative capacity at various locations. The challenges, such as economic, logistics, regulatory and political barriers, in generating renewable energy from biomass along with their potential solutions were also discussed. The study also provides a baseline for future research to evaluate and forecast the growth in bio-power generation potential of any biomass resource in a region based on crop yield and area of the region."

The integrated system includes a pressurized solar power tower, gas turbine unit, phase change material (PCM) for thermal energy storage (TES), Cu-Cl cycle, regenerative steam Rankine cycle (SRC), and a heat recovery unit. A predictive model is developed for energy, exergy, and exergo-economic analyses of the proposed system. A parametric study is also conducted to investigate the effect of major parameters on the system performance. The system is optimized with a non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-II (NSGA-II) considering exergy efficiency and product cost per unit exergy as the two objective functions. The results indicate that the energy and exergy efficiencies of the overall system are 48.2% and 45%, respectively, while the total product cost per unit of exergy is found to be $10.97/GJ. The integrated solar system produces hydrogen, electricity, and steam at a rate of 0.1 kg/s, 50.49 MW, and 13.93 kg/s, respectively. Pareto solutions for multi-objective optimization indicate that the optimal design point of the system has an exergy efficiency and total product cost per unit of exergy of 50.1% and $11.94/GJ, respectively."
316,Effect of institutional quality and renewable energy consumption on CO2 emissions-an empirical investigation for developing countries,"Haldar, Anasuya; Sethi, Narayan","This paper investigates the role of institutional quality in moderating the impact of energy consumption on CO2 emission, with other variables such as trade, capital formation, FDI, financial development and population in 39 developing countries for 1995-2017. We use mean group (MG), augmented mean group (AMG), common correlated effects mean group (CCEMG) estimator, dynamic system GMM, panel grouped-mean FMOLS and panel quantile regression for the empirical results. From the different estimation techniques, we find that institutional quality moderates energy consumption and strengthens its effectiveness in abating carbon emissions. The combined influence of institutional quality and sector wise energy consumption on emissions is significant and negative. Our finding also confirms the Environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) hypothesis in the presence of institutional quality. Renewable energy consumption is also found to reduce emissions significantly in the long run. Given the importance of institutional quality and renewable energy in reducing CO2 emission, the policymakers need to improve the quality of institutions and deploy more renewable energy for final consumption to achieve long-term climate goals."
317,"Exploring the linkage among energy intensity, carbon emission and urbanization in Pakistan: fresh evidence from ecological modernization and environment transition theories","Shah, Syed Ale Raza; Naqvi, Syed Asif Ali; Anwar, Sofia","This study uses ecological modernization and environmental transition theories to estimate the interaction among energy intensity, carbon emission and urbanization for the period of 1980-2017. We have systematically examined the empirical connections among emission, urbanization, income per capita, imports, exports, energy use, trade openness and energy intensity. The Johnson co-integration and Vector Error Correction Model (VECM) causality methods are employed for the sake of analysis. Overall findings confirm the dynamic and U-shaped relationship between emission and urbanization, and carbon emission and income per capita. The empirical results of urbanization, inflation and financial development illustrate positive association with the energy intensity, whereas trade openness, labour force participation and carbon emission show a negative association with the dependent variable. Moreover, outcomes of causality analysis provide evidence of varied causality link among the variables across the models. The study provides the implications for the decision makers in Pakistan to choose new urbanization patterns that are less reliant on energy consumption."
318,Role of renewable energy and globalization on ecological footprint in the USA: implications for environmental sustainability,"Usman, Ojonugwa; Akadiri, Seyi Saint; Adeshola, Ibrahim","The role of renewable energy and globalization on ecological footprint is investigated in the USA by controlling for the effects of financial development and real output using quarterly data from 1985:Q1 to 2014:Q4. We apply the minimum Lagrange multiplier unit root test, multiple structural break cointegration test, and autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) estimation approach. The empirical evidence suggests that, in the long run, renewable energy and real output exert negative pressure on ecological footprint while financial development and globalization exert positive pressure on ecological footprint. The short-run results indicate that renewable energy, financial development, real output, and globalization are positively linked to ecological footprint. The vector error correction model Granger causality results, in the long run, divulge that ecological footprint, consumption of renewable energy, real output, and globalization Granger-cause financial development while ecological footprint, renewable energy, financial development, and globalization Granger-cause real output. The results also show that, in the short run, renewable energy and globalization cause ecological footprint and real output causes renewable energy, while renewable energy causes globalization. The finding also reveals that the causality between real output and globalization, as well as globalization and financial development, is bidirectional. Therefore, our findings provide insights for policymakers to consider consumption of renewable energy as a surest way to mitigate carbon dioxide emissions."

The questionnaire included a free description format for the inconveniences and adaptations in daily living; a content analysis was performed. The recorded inconveniences included 148 physical, 84 mental, and 52 social problems. Patients who underwent spine surgery had significantly more recorded physical problems than those who did not (p < 0.05). Pain and numbness were significantly higher in patients aged ≥ 50 yr (p < 0.05). The 160 and 1 adaptations were for physical and social problems, respectively. No patient adaptation was found for mental health problems. Individual adaptations by ACH/HCH patients can improve only some aspects of physical and social problems. Multilateral social support is needed to resolve patients' issues."
320,The Impact of Energy Consumption and Economic Growth on Carbon Dioxide Emissions,"Osobajo, Oluyomi A.; Otitoju, Afolabi; Otitoju, Martha Ajibola; Oke, Adekunle","This study explored the effect of energy consumption and economic growth on CO2 emissions. The relationship between energy consumption, economic growth and CO2 emissions was assessed using regression analysis (the pooled OLS regression and fixed effects methods), Granger causality and panel cointegration tests. Data from 70 countries between 1994-2013 were analysed. The result of the Granger causality tests revealed that the study variables (population, capital stock and economic growth) have a bi-directional causal relationship with CO2 emissions, while energy consumption has a uni-directional relationship. Likewise, the outcome of the cointegration tests established that a long-run relationship exists among the study variables (energy consumption and economic growth) with CO2 emissions. However, the pooled OLS and fixed methods both showed that energy consumption and economic growth have a significant positive impact on CO2 emissions. Hence, this study supports the need for a global transition to a low carbon economy primarily through climate finance, which refers to local, national, or transnational financing, that may be drawn from public, private and alternative sources of financing. This will help foster large-scale investments in clean energy, that are required to significantly reduce CO2 emissions."
321,Circular ecosystem innovation: An initial set of principles,"Konietzko, Jan; Bocken, Nancy; Hultink, Erik Jan","A circular economy maximizes the value of material resources and minimizes greenhouse gas emissions, resource use, waste and pollution. We will posit that circularity needs to be understood as a property of a system (e.g., the mobility system of a city), rather than a property of an individual product or service (e.g., a car or a car-sharing service). Hence, there is a need for more knowledge on how to innovate towards 'circular ecosystems'. This study proposes a set of principles for 'circular ecosystem innovation', based on: 1) a concise literature review to retrieve recommended principles on how to successfully innovate in ecosystems, 2) a mobility case of circular ecosystem innovation to investigate how relevant and useful these principles are for circular oriented innovation. The case data include 20 interviews, workshop data and internal background documents. The identified principles can be categorized in three groups: 1) collaboration (i.e., how firms can interact with other organizations in their ecosystem to innovate towards circularity), 2) experimentation (i.e., how firms can organize a structured trial-and-error process to implement greater circularity) and 3) platformization (i.e., how firms can organize social and economic interactions via online platforms to achieve greater circularity). Future research may focus on identifying opportunities and barriers to applying these principles in different contexts than in the one that is investigated in the present study.

322,An integrated GIS approach for site selection of floating offshore wind farms in the Atlantic continental European coastline,"Diaz, H.; Soares, C. Guedes","This study presents a novel method for the selection of sites for floating wind farms based on marine spatial optimization. After providing a review of the present state of the art, a tool based on geographic information systems is presented, consisting of three main stages and built in Python language. The first stage collects and analyses the information of the different regulatory bodies, marine spatial planning, maritime concessions and other sources. The second stage excludes not feasible sites for floating wind farms, based mostly on marine space use and on environmental constraints. The third stage characterises the available locations based on five major categories that are spatially dependent: metocean data, viability data, logistics, facilities, marine environment and techno-economic data. The proposed methodology is implemented at the Europe Atlantic coast, with specific reference to Portugal, Spain and France. These three countries together combine 3.362.408 km(2) of the Atlantic Exclusive Economic Zone, where in only 0.22% of that area could host floating offshore wind turbines. While further detailed studies about locations and legislative considerations are required, the effort made has contributed to eliminate unsuitable areas and identify those where sustainability can be maximized."
323,The Relationship Between Drinking Behavior and Conversational Processes During a Brief Alcohol Reduction Intervention for People with HIV,"Carolyn Lauckner,Justin Walthers,Jennifer Stuck,Kendall Bryant,E Jennifer Edelman,David A Fiellin,Nathan B Hansen,Christopher W Kahler,Molly Magill,Nadine R Mastroleo,Stephen A Maisto,Carolyn Lauckner,Justin Walthers,Jennifer Stuck,Kendall Bryant,E Jennifer Edelman,David A Fiellin,Nathan B Hansen,Christopher W Kahler,Molly Magill,Nadine R Mastroleo,Stephen A Maisto","People with HIV (PWH) frequently engage in unhealthy alcohol use, which can adversely affect antiretroviral adherence and HIV disease progression. Brief interventions based on Motivational Interviewing (MI), including the Brief Negotiated Interview (BNI), can help to reduce drinking. This study examines MI processes observed during a single 15-20 min BNI session delivered by social workers to PWH with unhealthy alcohol use (N = 59) in the context of a stepped care intervention to reduce alcohol consumption. BNI sessions were coded for technical and relational processes encouraged in MI, such as autonomy support, instructive language, and self-exploration. Multiple regression analyses explored the relationship between: (1) Participants' pre-intervention drinking behaviors (weekly drinks and heavy drinking days) and these MI processes, and (2) MI processes and intervention outcomes. Results indicated that PWH who reported more weekly drinks at baseline engaged in less self-exploration, while social workers delivering the BNI used less instructive language for those who reported more heavy drinking days. PWH who engaged in more self-exploration and received more autonomy support had fewer heavy drinking days 6 months after the intervention. These findings suggest the value of providing more opportunities within BNIs to encourage self-exploration, as it may help to enhance intervention efficacy."
324,Peri-operative neurological monitoring with electroencephalography and cerebral oximetry: a narrative review,"C K E Chung,C C M Poon,M G Irwin,C K E Chung,C C M Poon,M G Irwin","Surgery and anaesthesia subject the brain to considerable stress in the peri-operative period. This may be caused by potentially neurotoxic anaesthetic drugs, impaired cerebral perfusion and reperfusion injury related to surgery or thromboembolic events. Patient monitoring using electroencephalogram and cerebral oximetry can assist in optimising depth of anaesthesia and assessment of cerebral metabolic activity. However, research findings have been contradictory as to whether these monitors can help ameliorate peri-operative neurocognitive complications. In this narrative review, we will discuss recent evidence in the use of electroencephalography and cerebral oximetry and the underlying scientific principles. It is important to appreciate the raw electroencephalographic changes under anaesthesia and those associated with ageing, in order to interpret depth of anaesthesia indices correctly. Cerebral oximetry is useful not only for the detection of cerebral desaturation but also to identify those patients who are particularly vulnerable to injury, for better risk stratification. An algorithm-based approach may be most effective in managing the episodes of cerebral desaturation."
325,Psychiatric-Like Impairments in Mouse Models of Spinocerebellar Ataxias,"Filip Tichanek,Filip Tichanek","Many patients with spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) suffer from diverse neuropsychiatric issues, including memory impairments, apathy, depression, or anxiety. These neuropsychiatric aspects contribute per se to the reduced quality of life and worse prognosis. However, the extent to which SCA-related neuropathology directly contributes to these issues remains largely unclear. Behavioral profiling of various SCA mouse models can bring new insight into this question. This paper aims to synthesize recent findings from behavioral studies of SCA patients and mouse models. The role of SCA neuropathology for shaping psychiatric-like impairments may be exemplified in mouse models of SCA1. These mice evince robust cognitive impairments which are shaped by both the cerebellar as well as out-of-cerebellar pathology. Although emotional-related alternations are also present, they seem to be less robust and more affected by the specific distribution and character of the neuropathology. For example, cerebellar-specific pathology seems to provoke behavioral disinhibition, leading to seemingly decreased anxiety, whereas complex SCA1 neuropathology induces anxiety-like phenotype. In SCA1 mice with complex neuropathology, some of the psychiatric-like impairments are present even before marked cerebellar degeneration and ataxia and correlate with hippocampal atrophy. Similarly, complete or partial deletion of the implicated gene (Atxn1) leads to cognitive dysfunction and anxiety-like behavior, respectively, without apparent ataxia and cerebellar degeneration. Altogether, these findings collectively suggest that the neuropsychiatric issues have a biological basis partially independent of the cerebellum. As some neuropsychiatric issues may stem from weakening the function of the implicated gene, therapeutic reduction of its expression by molecular approaches may not necessarily mitigate the neuropsychiatric issues."
326,Behavioral and technical perspectives of green supply chain management practices: Empirical evidence from an emerging market,"Liu, Junjun; Hu, Houbao; Tong, Xun; Zhu, Qinghua","Recently, companies in emerging markets have implemented green supply chain management (GSCM) practices to tackle environmental issues. Drawing upon socio-technical systems theory, this study develops a conceptual model suggesting a sequential effect between two distinct categories of GSCM practices, namely behavioral (human and soft aspects) and technical (tangible and hard aspects) practices, on performance. We employ structural equation modeling method to test hypotheses based on survey responses from 200 Chinese manufacturers. The categorization of behavioral and technical GSCM practices and research findings contribute to the GSCM literature. Statistical results demonstrate the complete mediation effect of technical GSCM practices (e.g., green design, green manufacturing and reverse logistics) on the relationship between behavioral GSCM practices (e.g., relationship with customers and suppliers) and organizational performance. Such results recommend that companies in emerging markets should highlight behavioral GSCM practices first and then implement necessary technical GSCM practices to reap economic, environmental and operational performance."
327,Individual differences and the relationship between education and religiosity in longitudinal versus cross-sectional studies,"Yoav Ganzach,Yoav Ganzach","We show that the relationship between education and religiosity is positive in cross-sectional analyses and negative in longitudinal analyses. We explain this discrepancy by suggesting that the former relationship is due to the positive association of both education and religiosity with dispositional conformity, while the latter represents a causal effect of education on apostasy."

This study investigates the phytochemical composition, antioxidant and cytotoxic effects of L. elliptica leaf extracts. The phytochemical content was determined via GCMS analysis and total phenolic content (TPC) and total flavonoid content (TFC) were analysed using the Folin-Ciocalteu and aluminium-chloride assays. Antioxidant activities were determined using the 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) scavenging, 2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS) scavenging and ferric-ion reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) assays, whereas cytotoxicity was determined using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) and calcein/ethidium viability assays. The mechanism of cytotoxicity was investigated using Annexin V/propidium iodide. Modifications in the mitochondria were investigated using MitoTracker Red CMXRos. Ten and twenty-six compounds were characterized in the young-leaf and mixed-leaves extracts, respectively. The young-leaf methanolic extract demonstrated the highest antioxidant capacity of at least four-folds greater than the mixed-leaves and ethanolic extracts. The methanolic extract also had higher TPC and TFC values compared to the ethanolic extract. Although the mixed L. elliptica leaves had lower antioxidant capacities compared to the young leaves, the mixed leaves extract has demonstrated greater cytotoxicity against the A549 cancer cell line. Further investigation revealed that the L. elliptica leaves-induced cytotoxicity on A549 cells was possibly via the non-inflammatory mitochondria-mediated apoptotic pathway. Overall, our results showed the potential of the L. elliptica leaves possessing cytotoxic activities against carcinoma cells where the compounds present can be further investigated for its therapeutic application."

Addressing the issues of detection and collection of this hazardous waste that is littered in public spaces and outside the controlled environments, usually associated with biomedical waste, is urgent for the safety of the communities around the world. Manual management of this waste is beyond the capabilities of governments worldwide as the geospatial scale of littering is very high and also because this contaminated litter is a health and safety issue for the waste collectors. In this paper, an autonomous biomedical waste management framework that uses edge surveillance and location intelligence for detection of the littered face masks and predictive modelling for emergency response to this problem is proposed. In this research a novel dataset of littered face masks in various conditions and environments is collected. Then, a new deep neural network architecture for rapid detection of discarded face masks on the video surveillance edge nodes is proposed. Furthermore, a location intelligence model for prediction of the areas with higher probability of hazardous litter in the smart city is presented. Experimental results show that the accuracy of the proposed model for detection of littered face masks in various environments is 96%, while the speed of processing is ten times faster than comparable models. The proposed framework can help authorities to plan for timely emergency response to scattering of hazardous material in residential environments."
330,Hematological and biochemical investigations on the effect of curcumin and Thymoquinone in male mice exposed to Thioacetamide,"Atef M Al-Attar,Atef M Al-Attar","Currently, living organisms are increasingly exposed to many toxic chemicals in the environment. These substances pose a threat to human life, other living organisms and ecosystem. In fact, there is an increasing requirement to search for safe therapeutic sources today. Medicinal plants and natural products have become of great importance globally because of their therapeutic potential and medicinal properties, as well as their availability and the absence of harmful side effects for most of them. The present study was designed to explore the potential protective effect of curcumin (CUR) and thymoquinone (TQ) in male rats exposed to thioacetamide (TAA). The experimental mice were divided into eight groups. Group 1 was served as control. Group 2 was exposed to 50 mg/ kg body weight of TAA. Group 3 was exposed to CUR and TAA. Mice of group 4 were treated with TQ and TAA. Mice of group 5 were exposed to CUR plus TQ and TAA. Group 6 was supplemented with CUR. Group 7 was subjected to TQ. Mice of group 8 were treated with CUR and TQ. Hematological and biochemical alterations were evaluated after one month. Significant increases of white blood corpuscles (WBC), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), total bilirubin (TB), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) values were observed in group 2, while the values of red blood corpuscles (RBC), hemoglobin (Hb(, hematocrit (Hct), glutathione (GSH) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) were statistically decreased. Treatment with CUR, TQ and their combination inhibited the hematological and biochemical alterations induced by TAA toxicity. Moreover, the most protective effect was observed in mice treated with CUR plus TQ. These new results suggested that the protective effect of CUR and TQ attributed to their antioxidant properties."
331,Spatiotemporal Patterns of COVID-19 Impact on Human Activities and Environment in Mainland China Using Nighttime Light and Air Quality Data,"Liu, Qian; Sha, Dexuan; Liu, Wei; Houser, Paul; Zhang, Luyao; Hou, Ruizhi; Lan, Hai; Flynn, Colin; Lu, Mingyue; Hu, Tao; Yang, Chaowei","The sudden outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic has brought drastic changes to people's daily lives, work, and the surrounding environment. Investigations into these changes are very important for decision makers to implement policies on economic loss assessments and stimulation packages, city reopening, resilience of the environment, and arrangement of medical resources. In order to analyze the impact of COVID-19 on people's lives, activities, and the natural environment, this paper investigates the spatial and temporal characteristics of Nighttime Light (NTL) radiance and Air Quality Index (AQI) before and during the pandemic in mainland China. The monthly mean NTL radiance, and daily and monthly mean AQI are calculated over mainland China and compared before and during the pandemic. Our results show that the monthly average NTL brightness is much lower during the quarantine period than before. This study categorizes NTL into three classes: residential area, transportation, and public facilities and commercial centers, with NTL radiance ranges of 5-20, 20-40 and greater than 40 (nW center dot cm(-2)center dot sr(-1)), respectively. We found that the Number of Pixels (NOP) with NTL detection increased in the residential area and decreased in the commercial centers for most of the provinces after the shutdown, while transportation and public facilities generally stayed the same. More specifically, we examined these factors in Wuhan, where the first confirmed cases were reported, and where the earliest quarantine measures were taken. Observations and analysis of pixels associated with commercial centers were observed to have lower NTL radiance values, indicating a dimming behavior, while residential area pixels recorded increased levels of brightness after the beginning of the lockdown. The study also discovered a significant decreasing trend in the daily average AQI for mainland China from January to March 2020, with cleaner air in most provinces during February and March, compared to January 2020. In conclusion, the outbreak and spread of COVID-19 has had a crucial impact on people's daily lives and activity ranges through the increased implementation of lockdown and quarantine policies. On the other hand, the air quality of mainland China has improved with the reduction in non-essential industries and motor vehicle usage. This evidence demonstrates that the Chinese government has executed very stringent quarantine policies to deal with the pandemic. The decisive response to control the spread of COVID-19 provides a reference for other parts of the world."
332,"The role of renewable energy, alternative and nuclear energy in mitigating carbon emissions in the CPTPP countries",Duc Hong Vo; Anh The Vo; Chi Minh Ho; Ha Minh Nguyen,"The paper investigates the role of renewable energy and alternative and nuclear energy in mitigating CO2 emissions. Trade openness is added to consider its effect on the environment, as it appears to be a crucial factor in interregional cooperation and development. We adopt a sample of nine signatories to the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) from 1971 to 2014. Various time-series econometric methods are utilized including two long-run estimators - fully modified ordinary least squares (FMOLS) and dynamic ordinary least squares (DOLS) - and a Granger-causality test. Several noteworthy findings are achieved from this paper. First, the inverse U-shaped relationship is found in six countries: Australia, Canada, Chile, New Zealand, Peru and Vietnam. The U-shaped relationship is found in Japan and Malaysia whereas no evidence is observed in Mexico. Second, the adoption of either renewable energy or alternative and nuclear energy would mitigate CO2 emissions and trade openness plays an important role in facilitating this effect. Third, the directions of Granger causality among the variables of interests including consumption of renewable energy; consumption of alternative and nuclear energy, trade openness and CO2 emissions, do vary across countries and between the short term and the long term.

333,An effective three-stage hybrid optimization method for source-network-load power generation of cascade hydropower reservoirs serving multiple interconnected power grids,"Feng, Zhong-kai; Niu, Wen-jing; Cheng, Xiong; Wang, Jia-yang; Wang, Sen; Song, Zhen-guo","In China, many cascade hydropower reservoirs are asked to simultaneously respond the peak loads of several interconnected power grids based on the signed agreements. However, by far, there are few reports addressing the brand-new engineering problem with huge optimization difficulty caused by multilateral generation contracts, strong hydraulic-electric relationships, load feature differences and spatial-temporal coupled constraints. Here, a three-stage hybrid method is developed to satisfy this practical requirement, where the domain knowledge is firstly used to build a virtual load curve balancing the load features and electricity contracts of multiple power grids; secondly, the dynamic programming is used to determine the scheduling process of the optimized hydroplant, while the linear programming is chosen to allocate the hydropower generation among multiple power grids; finally, the quality of solution is gradually improved via iterative search. The results in two real-world cascade hydropower systems indicate that the hybrid method can achieve satisfactory scheduling results in different cases. Thus, an effective way to reduce the optimization difficulty of the large and complex problem is to break up into a series of simple and independent subproblems to be addressed by existing mature methods.

334,Supramolecular systems chemistry through advanced analytical techniques,"Ankit Jain,Annalisa Calò,Damià Barceló,Mohit Kumar,Ankit Jain,Annalisa Calò,Damià Barceló,Mohit Kumar","Supramolecular chemistry is the quintessential backbone of all biological processes. It encompasses a wide range from the metabolic network to the self-assembled cytoskeletal network. Combining the chemical diversity with the plethora of functional depth that biological systems possess is a daunting task for synthetic chemists to emulate. The only route for approaching such a challenge lies in understanding the complex and dynamic systems through advanced analytical techniques. The supramolecular complexity that can be successfully generated and analyzed is directly dependent on the analytical treatment of the system parameters. In this review, we illustrate advanced analytical techniques that have been used to investigate various supramolecular systems including complex mixtures, dynamic self-assembly, and functional nanomaterials. The underlying theme of such an overview is not only the exceeding detail with which traditional experiments can be probed but also the fact that complex experiments can now be attempted owing to the analytical techniques that can resolve an ensemble in astounding detail. Furthermore, the review critically analyzes the current state of the art analytical techniques and suggests the direction of future development. Finally, we envision that integrating multiple analytical methods into a common platform will open completely new possibilities for developing functional chemical systems."

Eurico B.; Bastos-Neto, Moises; Cavalcante, Celio L., Jr.","Given the increase in CO2 emissions, the adsorption process using zeolites are proposed to remove this compound from combustion gases in pulverized coal power plants. Besides it, these materials can also be synthesized using coal fly ash to reconcile environmental and economic concerns. The aim of this study was to measure the adsorption capacity of zeolites synthesized from coal fly ash compared with commercial zeolites and assess their performance in temperature swing adsorption processes. Two pelletized synthetic zeolites were selected, one NaX type (SZX) and one NaA type (SZA), and two commercial zeolites, one NaX (CZX) and one NaA (CZA). Zeolites were characterized by XRF, XRD and textural analysis (BET). Adsorption capacity tests were performed by thermogravimetric analysis using similar CO2 concentrations to those found in pulverized carbon combustion gases, without moisture. Isotherms were also obtained for synthetic and commercial zeolites type X. The XRD results showed substantial similarity between the commercial and synthesized zeolites, indicating a good degree of crystallinity. The CO2 adsorption capacity at 303 K for both samples showed values similar to those reported in the literature (1.97 mmol/g for SZX and 1.37 mmol/g for SZA), demonstrating their potential in commercial applications. After five cycles, the adsorption capacity of all samples remained practically unchanged, indicating the possibility of application in TSA processes. In the adsorption tests at different temperatures and in the isotherms, adsorption capacity declined as temperature increased for both samples, being similar to benchmark commercial 13X and 4A zeolite adsorbents."
336,Improving the energy efficiency of room air conditioners in China: Costs and benefits,"Karali, Nihan; Shah, Nihar; Park, Won Young; Khanna, Nina; Ding, Chao; Lin, Jiang; Zhou, Nan","China is the world's largest consumer of room air conditioners, and it contributes about a quarter of global space cooling CO2 emissions. We model the costs and benefits of recently proposed new room air conditioner minimum energy performance standards (MEPS) in China. Our results suggest that newly proposed MEPS brings accumulative CO2 emissions reductions of 12.8% between 2019 and 2050, and accumulative bill saving of 2620 billion RMB to China's consumers. The benefits of the proposed MEPS decrease with longer MEPS revision intervals and increase with shorter intervals-indicating that the intervals should be balanced to maximize benefits while accommodating constraints due to air conditioner manufacturer design cycles. We also model potential nationwide benefits from higher MEPS. Across two increasingly aggressive MEPS scenarios, China's room air conditioner electricity consumption and CO2 emissions in 2050 are both reduced by 15-53% compared to the proposed MEPS. The highest-efficiency scenario (reaching MEPS of annual performance factor 5.4 in 2025) provides the largest long-term national benefits. These results could inform development of a Chinese regulatory regime that effectively updates room air conditioner MEPS. Because China is the world's largest manufacturer of room air conditioners, the economic, energy, and emissions benefits resulting from higher Chinese MEPS could also have a global reach."

Because the Chinese firms chose to invest in clean energy projects as a result of the new BRI policy framework, this research shed light on the Chinese OFDI policy responses."
338,Towards a circular and low-carbon economy: Insights from the transitioning to electric vehicles and net zero economy,"Bonsu, Nana O.","Road transportation being a leading source of greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution, is now resulting a move away from the traditional internal combustion engine to electric vehicles (EVs), currently powered by battery technology. This paper examines end-of-first-life applications of EVs batteries in a low-carbon circular economy following global transition to EVs and net zero economy. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with key actors within the EV industry in the UK. Drawing on Stahel closed-loop solutions, a qualitative analysis of the transcripts of these interviews revealed the need for business models towards coherent low-carbon circular economy of the value chains. This paper reveals a whole range of issues relating to: extraction of battery critical raw minerals (e.g. ethical concerns); manufacturing (e.g. lack of policy frameworks addressing value chain emissions); distribution and sale (e.g. gaps in circular built economy strategy and transition plan); use (e.g. lack of a functioning market for end-of-first-life batteries) as well as research and innovation (e.g. lack of infrastructure to deal with end-of- first-life cells). The views on policy weaknesses testifies to the need for close-loop business model to not only focus on recycling battery raw minerals or repurposing battery for energy storage applications. But, should consider many aspects of an innovative policy strategy and product's global value chain, accounting for: equitable jobs, critical raw minerals dependency, circularity governance and industry standards, protecting the natural environment, tackling emissions and ensuring sustainable consumption and production patterns. The study highlights establishing key trade-offs within policy goals considering the global value chains, as well as, harnessing synergies between social, economic and environmental goals. The paper concludes that a low-carbon close-loop business model should integrate the triple objectives of making positive impact on people, planet and profit, and developed on the basis of legislation, collaboration, research, investment, and incentives guiding to achieve the Global Goals.

339,Sectoral-based CO2 emissions of Pakistan: a novel Grey Relation Analysis (GRA) approach,"Rehman, Erum; Ikram, Muhammad; Feng, Ma Tie; Rehman, Shazia","Global warming regarded as the major global issue over the past few decades, whereas carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions have been cited as one of the main causes of this problem. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the effect of energy consumption, economic development, and population growth on high CO2 emitting sectors of Pakistan such as transportation, industrial, and household. The data used in this study was taken from multiple databases from 2000 to 2018. We employed novel grey relational analysis (GRA) models to assess the connection between gross domestic product (GDP) per capita, population, energy consumption, and CO2 emission. Furthermore, the Hurwicz method was used to analyze which factor contributing more to CO2 emission. Result reveals that CO2 emission, gross domestic product per capita, population, and energy consumption showed a strong association among all sectors. Whereas, population contributes more to intensifying CO2 emissions in the transportation sector of Pakistan. This study provides useful insights for policymakers to take preventive and corrective measures to overcome CO2 emissions as well as sustainable development."
340,Waste-to-energy nexus for circular economy and environmental protection: Recent trends in hydrogen energy,"Sharma, Surbhi; Basu, Soumen; Shetti, Nagaraj P.; Aminabhavi, Tejraj M.","The energy demand has increased exponentially worldwide owing to the continuously growing population and urbanization. The conventional fossil fuels are unable to satiate this requirement causing price inflation and significant environmental damage due to unrestrained emission of greenhouse gases. The focus now has shifted towards alternative, economical, renewable and green sources of energy such as hydrogen to deal with this bottleneck. Hydrogen is a clean energy-source having high energy content (122 kJ/g). Recently, biological methods for the hydrogen production have attracted much attention because traditional methods are expensive, energy-exhaustive and not eco-friendly. The employment of biological methods promises utilization of waste or low-value materials for producing energy and building waste-to-energy nexus. Around 94% of the waste is discarded precariously in India and waste generation is growing at an alarming rate of 13% per year. The ""waste-to-energy"" techniques follow 'Reuse, Reduce, Recycle, Recovery and Reclamation' system solving three subjects at once; waste-management, energy-demand and environmental concern. Moreover, these methods have easy operability, cost-effectiveness and they help to shift from linear to circular model of economy for sustainable development. Biological processing of waste materials like agricultural discard (lignocellulosic biomass), food-waste and industrial discharge can be used for biohydrogen production. Dark and photo fermentation are the chief biological processes for the transformation of organic substrates to hydrogen. Dark fermentation is the acidogenic fermentation of carbohydrate-rich materials without light and oxygen. Clostridia, Enterobacter and Bacillus spp. are appropriate heterotrophic bacteria for dark fermentation. Various pretreatment methods like heat treatment, acid or base treatment ultrasonication, aeration, electroporation, etc., can be applied on inoculums to increase H-2 producing bacteria eventually improving the hydrogen yield. However, only around 33% of COD in organic materials is transformed to H-2 by this method. Photofermentation by the photosynthetic non-sulfur bacteria (PNS) converts organic substrate to H-2 and CO2 in the presence of nitrogenase enzyme in ammonium-limited and anoxygenic conditions. Rhodobacter or Rhodopseudomonas strains have been widely examined in this regard. But these methods are only able to produce H-2 with a poor yield. Combining dark and photofermentation is a noteworthy alternative for procuring enhanced hydrogen yields. Two-stage sequential method utilizes volatile fatty adds accumulated as byproducts after dark fermentation ( in the first stage) for photofermentation by suitable bacteria (in the second stage). A proper investigation of the dark fermenter effluents is required before using them as a substrate for photo-fermentation. In a single-stage dark and photofermentation, co-culture of anaerobic and PNS bacteria in a single reactor is carried out for obtaining improved yield. The single stage system is comparatively inexpensive and less laborious; moreover, a limited requirement for an intermediate dilution stage is necessary. Economic analysis of hydrogen production showed that H-2 production by the present methods, save pyrolysis, is reasonably higher than the conventional approaches of fuel production. Probable routes to make H-2 production more cost-effective are reducing the cost of photobioreactor. installing proper storage system. etc. A constructive effort in the area of research and development of biological approaches of H-2 production technologies is vital. The commercial viability of biohydrogen production is imperative for accomplishment of circular economy system and sustainable development. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."
341,"The Colonial State, African Dog-Owners, and the Political Economy of Rabies Vaccination Campaigns in Southern Rhodesia in the 1950s and 1960s","Innocent Dande,Innocent Dande","This paper examines histories of postvaccinal breaks in immunity to rabies in domestic dogs between 1950 and the 1960s. It utilizes Veterinary and Native Commissioner's reports and newspapers in arguing that there is a gap in current southern African rabies historiography as it is yet to grapple with narratives about vaccine technologies. Current southern African rabies histories overly focus on white South African urban case studies. Focusing on the histories of postvaccinal breaks in immunity to rabies in Southern Rhodesia helps to explain why rabies became an ineradicable canine disease in southern Africa during this period. The paper focuses on the political economy of the mass vaccination of dogs, the costs attached to the Veterinary Department's decision to ignore other canine diseases in African areas, and how this, combined with other policy measures such as dog taxation, in undermining rabies vaccination campaigns. Overall, it shows that African dog-owners resorted to a myriad of responses to coercive rabies regulations. This complexity ultimately resulted in canine rabies becoming a difficult disease to eradicate."
342,Signifying the imperative nexus between climate change and information and communication technology development: a case from Pakistan,"Shehzad, Khurram; Liu, Xiaoxing; Sarfraz, Muddassar; Zulfiqar, Muhammad","The globe has faced technological affluence that enormously revolutionized the lives of humankind. Today, the manufacturing process of the energy sector, production sector, agriculture sector, and service sector is exclusively or partially based on ICT tools. The key intention of this investigation is to find out the impacts of the utilization of ICT on CO(2)emission. However, this investigation also evaluates the influence of investment in ICT and the trade of ICT tools on CO(2)emission. Further, the estimation examined the subsistence of environment Kuznets curve (EKC) theory, for the nation of Pakistan. The investigation employed an autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) model and found that the utilization of ICT has a negative impact on CO(2)emission. Moreover, the long-run results revealed that the import of ICT equipment is more beneficial for the environment quality of Pakistan. However, ICT apparatus manufactured in Pakistan might produce electronic waste due to non-utilization of green technology. The study reported bidirectional causality between ICT and CO(2)emission. These results point towards that the emergence of ICT in industries and daily life possesses a significant and positive role in climate change in Pakistan. Also, this study corroborates the veracity of EKC in Pakistan."
343,Association between the Val66Met polymorphism (rs6265/G196A) of the BDNF gene and cognitive performance with SSRI use in Arab Alzheimer's disease patients,"N Abanmy,J Alsabhan,P Gard,G Scutt,N Abanmy,J Alsabhan,P Gard,G Scutt","Brain derived neutrophic factor (BDNF) is a protein and a member of the neurotrophin family of growth factors, supports the survival of existing neurons and encourages the growth and differentiation of new neurons and synapses. The BDNF gene Val66Met polymorphism (rs6265/G196A) is responsible for BDNF synthesis that impact BDNF function that includes memory and cognition. This study investigated whether the BDNF gene Val66Met polymorphism (rs6265/G196A) is associated with cognitive function changes in both Alzheimer disease (AD) patients and elderly participants. In addition the impact of SSRI use on cognition improvement will be assessed. Healthy young, middle ages (25-59 years old) and elderly (more than 60 years old) participants (140) as well as 40 AD patients of whom are both of Saudi Arabian origin were recruited. The genotyping for the association study was performed by real-time PCR using Taqman chemistry in the ABI Prism 7900HT Sequence Detection System. Both Mini-Mental Status Examination (MMSE) and Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) were used to assess cognitive function of healthy and AD participants, respectively. The findings showed that the BDNF Val66Met genotype distributions and allele frequencies have significant association with cognitive performance in both elderly control group and AD patients. The main findings showed that carriers of GG homozygotes (Val/Val) have superior cognitive performance among AD patients and elderly control subjects. In addition the use of SSRIs in 13 AD patients and 17 elderly participants positively improved cognitive function in elderly (p > 0.001) but not in AD patients (p = 0.1)."
344,Oil rents and greenhouse gas emissions: spatial analysis of Gulf Cooperation Council countries,"Mahmood, Haider; Furqan, Maham","The dependence of oil production in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) region may have environmental consequences. This research explores the nonlinear effects of oil rents and the economic growth of six GCC countries on their per capita CO2, CH4, N2O, and Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions, considering spatial linkages through 1980-2014. We apply fixed effects (FE) and corroborate the spatial dependency in all estimated pollution models. Spatial Durbin model (SDM) is utilized to estimate the direct and spillover effects. We find the inverted U-shaped relationship of economic growth with CO2, CH4, N2O and GHG emissions, and of oil rents with CH(4)and GHG emissions. Monotonic positive effects of oil rents on CO(2)emissions and U-shaped relationship between oil rents and N2O emissions are also found. Urbanization has positive effect on the CO2, CH(4)and GHG emissions and has negative effect on N2O emissions. Financial market development (FMD) has negative effects on all types of investigated emissions. Foreign direct investment (FDI) has negative effects on CO(2)and N2O emissions. Energy use has positive effects on CO(2)and N2O emissions. Further, the neighboring spillover effects of economic growth, oil rents, urbanization, FDI, energy use and FMD are found statistically significant for some investigated emissions. Hence, oil rents, energy use, urbanization and economic growth are responsible for environmental degradation of home and neighboring countries in the GCC region, and we recommend implementing tighter laws to protect the environment."
345,Partial nephrogenic diabetes insipidus with a novel arginine vasopressin receptor 2 gene variant,"Atsushi Ishida,Haruo Mizuno,Kohei Aoyama,Shiori Sasaki,Yutaka Negishi,Takeshi Arakawa,Takayasu Mori,Atsushi Ishida,Haruo Mizuno,Kohei Aoyama,Shiori Sasaki,Yutaka Negishi,Takeshi Arakawa,Takayasu Mori","X-linked nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI) is caused by variations in arginine vasopressin receptor 2 (AVPR2). Some patients show partial resistance to arginine vasopressin (AVP). A 19-month-old Japanese boy presented with polydipsia since infancy. His mother had a history of polydipsia during pregnancy, and his maternal granduncle also had polydipsia. Intermediate urine osmolality and markedly high plasma AVP levels were observed in the water deprivation test. Subsequent pitressin administration caused no further elevation in urine osmolality. We diagnosed the patient with partial NDI, initiated therapy with hydrochlorothiazide, and placed him on a low-sodium diet. Although his urine volume decreased by 20-30% after the initiation of therapy, progressive hydronephrosis and growth retardation developed 2 years later. We investigated his genetic background by multiplex targeted sequencing of genes associated with inherited renal diseases, including AVPR2 and aquaporin-2 (AQP2). We identified a hemizygous missense variant in AVPR2 NM_000054:c.371A>G,p.(Tyr124Cys) in the boy and a heterozygous variant in the mother at the same locus. Distinguishing partial NDI from primary polydipsia is difficult because of its mild symptoms. Markedly elevated plasma AVP levels with intermediate urine osmolality may suggest partial NDI, and genetic analysis can be useful for such patients."
346,Production of synthetic natural gas from industrial carbon dioxide,"Chauvy, Remi; Dubois, Lionel; Lybaert, Paul; Thomas, Diane; De Weireld, Guy","The Power-to-Gas strategy has become a mainstream topic for decarbonization and development of renewables and flexibility in energy systems. One of the key arguments for decarbonizing the gas network is to take advantage of existing network infrastructure, gradually transitioning to lower fossil carbon sources of methane from Power-to-Gas. This work proposes the techno-economic investigation of an integrated system considering an advanced CO2 capture process, in terms of solvent and process configuration, to treat about 10% of a cement plant's flue gas and convert the captured CO2 into synthetic natural gas using renewable hydrogen generated from a large-scale wind powered electrolyzer. An optimized heat recovery system is proposed, drastically decreasing the external hot utility demand of the CO2 capture unit. In addition, it leads to the production of complementary electricity (about 1.06 MW), reducing thus also the electrical demand of the integrated process. The synthetic natural gas produced has a composition (CH4 92.9 mol.%, CO2 3.7 mol.%, and H-2 3.4 mol.%) and a Wobbe index (46.72 MJ/m(3)), corresponding to specification for gas grid injection at 50 bar in Germany. With an overall system efficiency of 72.6%, the process produces 0.40 ton synthetic natural gas per ton of captured CO2. The cost of the synthetic natural gas produced is higher when compared to the present natural gas market price, but cost reductions and possible commercial use of coproducts like oxygen, represent a likely alternative. Costs are mainly driven by high capital investments (the electrolyzer), and the price of renewable electricity, which is expected to decrease in the coming years."

However, this modality presents barriers that make rehabilitation difficult. For this reason, home-based pulmonary rehabilitation (HBPR) has been used to overcome these barriers. The objective was to systematically compare a structured program with HBPR or a control group for participants with COPD. The primary outcome was an improvement in symptoms in the level of dyspnea and secondary outcomes were parameters in lung function, exercise capacity, health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and the impact of the disease on the individual. The Medline (via PubMed), Virtual Health Library and Cochrane Library databases were searched until May 10, 2021. Randomized controlled trials were included without restrictions on the year of publication or language. The risk of bias was evaluated using the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool for randomized trials (RoB). Our results showed that there was a significant decrease in the level of dyspnea, (MD: 5.46; 95% CI: 1.97 to 8.96), increased distance covered (MD: 61.75; 95% CI: 42, 94 to 80.56, significant improvement in HRQoL (MD: -11.30; 95% CI: -19.81 to -2.79) and reduction in the impact of the disease (DM: -4.71; 95% CI: -7.95 to -1.47). All results found were comparing the intervention group versus the control group. To conclude we found a reduction in the levels of dyspnea, an increase in the distance covered on the six-minute walk test, improving HRQoL and decreasing the impact of the disease in COPD patients in home-based pulmonary rehabilitation."
348,"Multi-objective optimization and selection of hybrid combined cooling, heating and power systems considering operational flexibility","Wang, Jiangjiang; Liu, Yi; Ren, Fukang; Lu, Shuaikang","This paper proposes a multi-objective optimization model integrated with operational flexibility to optimize a hybrid combined cooling, heating and power (CCHP) system. The operational flexibility of the hybrid CCHP system is proposed and expressed by the combined indicators to show the capacity to resist performance degradation because of externally variable conditions to increase energy saving and cost saving, to reduce carbon dioxide emissions, and to enhance renewability, the ability to adjust heat and electricity, and the grid integration level. A Pareto frontier of solutions considering a larger operational flexibility with less performance degradation is obtained in genetic algorithm. The use of a multi-criteria decision making method combined with an entropy weighting method is employed to quantitatively evaluate the composite sustainability index of the Pareto schemes and choose the optimal hybrid CCHP option with the best integrated performance. The results of a case study that considers operational flexibility and optimization indicated that the potential adjustable ability was increased by 438.9%, and the grid integration level and net interaction with the grid were decreased by 3.6%. However, the increase in flexibility reduces the energetic, economic and environmental benefits achieved by the CCHP system by 5.1%, 56.4% and 3.0%, respectively. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

349,Techno-economic assessment of energy storage systems using annualized life cycle cost of storage (LCCOS) and levelized cost of energy (LCOE) metrics,"Mostafa, Mostafa H.; Aleem, Shady H. E. Abdel; Ali, Samia G.; Ali, Ziad M.; Abdelaziz, Almoataz Y.","Energy generation from renewable energy sources (RESs) is rapidly developing across the world to improve the performance of power networks and increase the share of RESs in world energy production. In this regard, energy storage (ES) technologies are the key enablers for reliable use of renewables because they introduce many benefits for modern power systems. However, the choice of a suitable technology depends on several technoeconomic metrics, which require the decision-maker to investigate the applicability of the technology and whether it offers promising benefits or not. Hence, this paper presents an ES cost model that considers long-term, medium-term, and short-term ES applications, technologies and technical characteristics in an integrated framework that consider the ES technical and economic characteristics supported by in-market insight, including capital costs of the technologies; operation and maintenance costs; replacement costs during the lifetime of the system; and disposal and recycling costs, based on the current ES costs. Two key metrics, namely the annualized life cycle cost of storage (LCCOS) and the levelized cost of energy (LCOE), are used to make proper ES operational choices while complying with their technical and operational performance limits. Further, a sensitivity analysis of the governing factors that affect the storage cost is presented to introduce a powerful decision tool to empower techno-economic assessment of ES systems using the proposed cost models."
350,Isolation and identification of the oral bacteria and their characterization for bacteriocin production in the oral cavity,"Saad Alghamdi,Saad Alghamdi","Oral cavity is a diverse ecosystem which harbors immense diversity of microorganisms like fungi, virus and bacteria. Some of these microorganisms are involved in causing multiple infections. Oral flora is continuously changing due to connection with the external environment and produce bacteriocin against each other to compete for nutrient in this mini ecosystem. Current study was aimed to explore and compare the bacterial fauna of both healthy and non-healthy dental samples, by isolation and identification with biochemical tests to characterize the bacteriocin production. During study 120 swabs were taken from both healthy and unhealthy subjects. Samples were collected from the dental clinics of Makkah City, in sterile eppendorfs containing 1 ml nutrient broth, and were incubated overnight using shaking incubator. Bacteria were isolated following identification through Gram staining, microscopy and biochemical test. Total 15 strains of bacteria were isolated during the study amongst which 8 strains were gram positive and 7 strains were gram negative. The most dominant species of the gram positive strains was Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 26). On the other hand, Escherichia coli (n = 26) was the prominent specie amongst the gram negative strains. Overall, the dominated family was Enterobacteriaceae (19.36%) followed by Streptococcaceae with 13.83% abundance. One of the most cariogenic strain Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 14) was also isolated. The bacterial strain diversity between these two type of ecosystem was approximately the same, with slight variation in Shannon (HS:2.627187, NHS:2.653594) and Simpson diversity (HS:0.923461, NHS: 0.92684) index. The current research revealed that bacteriocin production in the Enterobacter species was prominent against Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Apart from this other strains like Klebsiella pneumoniae and Exiguobacterium spp were also able to produce bacteriocin against Enterobacter species and Bacillus cereus respectively."

Countries all over the world have implemented some sort of lockdown to slow down its infection and mitigate it. Lockdown due to COVID-19 has drastic effects on social and economic fronts. However, this lockdown also has some positive effect on natural environment. Recent data released by NASA (National Aeronautics and Space Administration) and ESA (European Space Agency) indicates that pollution in some of the epicenters of COVID-19 such as Wuhan, Italy, Spain and USA etc. has reduced up to 30%. This study compiled the environmental data released by NASA and ESA before and after the coronavirus pandemic and discusses its impact on environmental quality."
352,Unique and overlapping contributions of sustained attention and working memory to parent and teacher ratings of inattentive behavior,"Eadaoin J Slattery,Patrick Ryan,Donal G Fortune,Laura P McAvinue,Eadaoin J Slattery,Patrick Ryan,Donal G Fortune,Laura P McAvinue","Sustained attention and working memory are two closely intertwined executive functions that may underlie inattentive behavior. However, little research has teased apart their precise contributions in a single study. This study examines the extent to which ratings of children's inattentive behavior are associated with these executive functions. Specifically, we investigated the unique and overlapping statistical contributions of sustained attention capacity and working memory capacity to parent and teacher ratings of inattentive behavior (operationalized as scores on both the Inattentive and Hyperactive/Impulsive scales of the Conners' Rating Scale), while controlling for IQ. Children aged 8-11 years completed measures of sustained attention capacity, working memory capacity and IQ. Parents and teachers completed Conners-3 Parent and Teacher Short Forms, as a measure of inattentive behavior. We found that the unique statistical contribution of sustained attention capacity emerged as the most important factor in both parent and teacher ratings of inattentive behavior, with effects of moderate magnitude. In contrast, working memory capacity accounted for a small amount of variance. The overlap between sustained attention and working memory explained a small but substantive amount of variance in inattentive behavior. These findings support the idea that sustained attention and working memory are distinct executive functions that may contribute to goal-directed behavior both uniquely and through their interactions."
353,Lower vitamin D levels and VDR FokI variants are associated with susceptibility to sepsis: a hospital-based case-control study,"Xinyue Yang,Jin Ru,Zhengchao Li,Xingpeng Jiang,Chuming Fan,Xinyue Yang,Jin Ru,Zhengchao Li,Xingpeng Jiang,Chuming Fan","Background: Vitamin D deficiency has been associated with increased sepsis incidence and mortality in various populations. Vitamin D exerts its effect through vitamin receptor (VDR), and various single nucleotide polymorphisms have been reported to affects the expression and structure of the VDR. In the present study, we investigated the possible role of vitamin D deficiency and VDR polymorphisms in susceptibility to sepsis.Methods: 576 sepsis patients and 421 healthy controls were enrolled in the present study. Plasma vitamin D levels in patients and healthy controls were quantified by ELISA. Genetic variants in the VDR (FokI, TaqI, BsmI, and ApaI) were genotyped by TaqMan assay.Results: Reduced serum Vitamin D level was observed in subjects with sepsis compared to healthy controls (p ≤ 0.0001). Further, subjects with septic shock had diminished 25(OH) vitamin D compared to severe sepsis cases (p ≤ 0.0001). FokI variants and minor alleles were more prevalent in sepsis patients compared to healthy controls (Ff: p ≤ 0.0001, χ2 =17.39; ff: p=0.001, χ2 =10.79; f: p ≤ 0.0001, χ2 =23.51). Furthermore, combined plasma levels of 25(OH) vitamin D and FokI polymorphism revealed a significant role in a predisposition to sepsis and septic shock. However, the prevalence of other VDR polymorphisms (TaqI, BsmI and ApaI) were comparable among different clinical categories.Conclusions: Low 25(OH) vitamin D levels and FokI mutants are associated with an increased risk of sepsis and septic shock in a Chinese cohort.Clinical significanceLower levels of 25-OH vitamin D are highly prevalent in Sepsis patients.Subjects harbouring VDR FokI variants are predisposed to susceptibility to sepsis in the studied cohort."
354,The impact of emricasan on chronic liver diseases: current data,"Vasileios Lekakis,Evangelos Cholongitas,Vasileios Lekakis,Evangelos Cholongitas","Immoderate caspase-mediated apoptosis in chronic liver injury is a crucial driver of sustained HSC activation and worsening hepatic inflammation as well as fibrosis, with the ultimate outcome of liver cirrhosis and its consequences. Therefore, the inhibition of hepatocyte apoptosis by caspase cascade blockage may be a promising therapeutic strategy to achieve fibrosis regression in chronic liver diseases. Emricasan is a broad-spectrum, liver-targeted caspase inhibitor with a favorable pharmacokinetic profile, characterized by prolonged retention in the liver and low systemic exposure after oral administration. In animal models, emricasan had a clear intrahepatic anti-apoptotic effect with consequent elimination of circulating pro-inflammatory cytokines and favorable impact in liver fibrogenesis and portal pressure. Even though, this intrahepatic drug effect confirmed in human clinical trials, no clear linkage was emerged with portal hypertension, liver function or liver histology in both non-cirrhotic and cirrhotic patients except from a subgroup of patients with high MELD score (> 15) or severe HVPG (> 16 mmHg). As emricasan treatment appeared safe and well-tolerated, irrespective the severity of liver disease, more studies are required to clarify better these subgroups of patients who may benefit most from this drug."
355,Comparative techno-economic study of solar energy integrated hydrogen supply pathways for hydrogen refueling stations in China,"Gu, Yu; Chen, Qianqian; Xue, Junli; Tang, Zhiyong; Sun, Yuhan; Wu, Qing","To decarbonize transportation sector, one of the most promising solution is using green hydrogen as an alternative transport fuel to gasoline and diesel. For countries with uneven distribution of renewable energy, it is necessary to evaluate both cross-regional and on-site green hydrogen supply pathways. The goal of this paper is to identify the economic, energy and environmental aspects of potential solar energy integrated green hydrogen supply routes including cross-regional and on-site options for hydrogen refueling stations in China. Four green hydrogen supply routes are proposed in our study: 1) northwest solar power integrated methanol production as hydrogen carrier coupled with cross-regional delivery to hydrogen refueling station for onsite hydrogen production pathway (Route I), 2) northwest solar power integrated hydrogen production coupled with gas H-2 crossregional delivery pathway (Route II), 3) northwest solar power integrated hydrogen production coupled with liquid H-2 cross-regional delivery pathway (Route III) and 4) on-site solar energy-powered hydrogen refueling station (Route IV). The results indicate that solar energy integrated hydrogen supply pathways have remarkable CO2 emission reduction effect. Route I, Route II, Route III and Route IV can reduce CO2 emission by 83%, 59%, 96%, and more than 99% respectively, compared with the conventional coal gasification for hydrogen production coupled with gas H-2 delivery to nearby fueling station pathway (coal-H-2 delivery). In term of energy consumption, Route III and Route IV show advantage in energy efficiency, which consumes 27% and 38% less energy compared with coal-H-2 delivery, respectively. In economic aspect, the four routes are not competitive with conventional coal-H-2 delivery, but from the perspective of green hydrogen supply, Route I and Route III are economically competitive compared with on-site solar energy-powered hydrogen refueling station (Route IV). If considering carbon tax in 2030 reported by World Bank, Route I will have potential to be economically competitive with coal-H-2 delivery. Route III is also expected to be economically feasible as the solar energy electricity price and liquefaction cost further decline."
356,Novel hybrid solar tower-gas turbine combined power cycles using supercritical carbon dioxide bottoming cycles,"Mohammadi, Kasra; Ellingwood, Kevin; Powell, Kody","In this study, two novel hybrid solar power tower-gas turbine combined power cycles are proposed, in which two supercritical CO2 (s-CO2) power cycles connected in series are driven by waste energy from a gas turbine cycle partially driven by a solar power tower. The solar power tower system provides a high-temperature thermal energy up to 1223 K. Each of the two novel schemes consists of a combined cycle with configuration 1 combining an s-CO2 recompression cycle and an s-CO2 recuperative cycle as bottoming cycles. Configuration 2 replaces the recompression cycle with an s-CO2 partial cooling cycle. Another objective is to evaluate the suitability of the two novel configurations against two conventional combined cycles including a bottoming steam Rankine cycle driven by a single-pressure heat recovery steam generator (HRSG) and dual-pressure HRSG. A thermodynamic and economic analysis is conducted for the plants, all sized at 50 MWe, and found that while configuration 1 has the lowest overall cycle efficiency of 0.4608, it exhibits the lowest levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) of $83.16/MWh, due to its compact components. The highest overall cycle efficiency of 0.5066 is obtained for the configuration that employs a bottoming steam Rankine cycle with dual-pressure HRSG, which exhibits an LCOE of $85.08/MWh. Transient analysis of the cycle configuration 1 further highlighted a high solar share over 0.652 during the month of June. A sensitivity analysis examined the effect of the maximum and minimum pressures and the compressor inlet temperature of the two bottoming s-CO2 cycles, and design direct normal irradiance (DNI) on power plant performance, required field size, and LCOE. The lowest LCOE of $80.90/MWh for configuration 1 is realized when the compressor inlet temperatures approach 308 K for both s-CO2 cycles. Increasing the design DNI levels corresponds to a significant decrease in LCOE but results in lower solar shares."
357,Check updates Original Optimization and techno-economic assessment of concentrated solar power (CSP) in South-Western Africa: A case study on Ghana,"Agyekum, Ephraim Bonah; Velkin, Vladimir Ivanovich","The techno-economic performance of two different CSP technologies i.e. Solar tower (ST) and parabolic trough (PT) were evaluated in this paper, each at two different locations in Ghana (Navrongo and Tamale) using the System Advisor Model (SAM) software. From the simulated results, levelized cost of energy (LCOE) of 13.67 cent/ kWh and 14.73 cent/kWh were recorded for the ST modelled at Navrongo and Tamale, respectively. The PT power plant simulated at Tamale and Navrongo also recorded an LCOE of 28.83 cent/kWh and 25.83 cent/kWh, respectively. It was observed that, the optimum solar multiple (SM) for the ST ranges between 1.4 and 1.9, this is because the least LCOEs for the different thermal energy storage (TES) periods are within that range. In the case of the PT power plants, the SM also depends on the period of the TES and each TES has a distinct SM ranging between 2.4 and 4. Results from the analysis suggests that the ST technology is the optimal system for the Ghanaian weather conditions. The study concludes that the bankability of CSP technology in Ghana depends on the type of financial conditions for the project. Therefore, appropriate policies from government are necessary to help in their development."
358,A Primary Care Intervention to Increase HIV Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) Uptake in Patients with Syphilis,"Ryan Bonner,Jessica Stewart,Ashish Upadhyay,R Douglas Bruce,Jessica L Taylor,Ryan Bonner,Jessica Stewart,Ashish Upadhyay,R Douglas Bruce,Jessica L Taylor","Identifying candidates for HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is a barrier to improving PrEP uptake in priority populations. Syphilis infection is an indication for PrEP in all individuals and can be easily assessed by primary care providers (PCP) and health systems. This retrospective study evaluated the impact of a multidisciplinary provider outreach intervention on PrEP uptake in patients with a positive syphilis test result in a safety-net hospital-based primary care practice. The PCPs of PrEP-eligible patients with a positive syphilis result were notified via the electronic medical record (EMR) about potential PrEP eligibility and institutional HIV PrEP resources. Rates of PrEP offers and prescriptions were compared in the pre (8/1/2018-12/31/2018, n = 60) and post (1/1/2019-5/31/2019, n = 86) intervention periods. Secondary analyzes evaluated receipt of appropriate syphilis treatment and contemporaneous screening for HIV, gonorrhea, and chlamydia. No significant differences in the overall proportion of patients offered (15% vs 19%) and prescribed (7% vs 5%) PrEP were observed between the pre- and post-periods. Overall, 7% of positive tests represented infectious syphilis. The rate of appropriate syphilis treatment was equivalent (57% vs 56%) and contemporaneous screening for other sexually transmitted infections was suboptimal across the entire study period. Although any positive syphilis test may be an easily abstracted metric from the EMR, this approach was inclusive of many patients without current HIV risk and did not increase PrEP uptake significantly. Future research into population health approaches to increase HIV prevention should focus on patients with infectious syphilis and other current risk factors for incident HIV infection."
359,The effect of financial development on renewable energy consumption. A panel data approach,"Anton, Sorin Gabriel; Nucu, Anca Elena Afloarei","One of the strategic objectives of the European Union is to increase the renewable energy consumption level, in a market which brings together technological, financing and customer engagement innovations. However, little is known about the impact of the financial sector on renewable energy consumption. The aim of the paper is to examine the effect of financial development on renewable energy consumption using a panel data of 28 countries in the European Union (EU) over the period 1990-2015. Our research is based on a panel fixed effects model, where renewable energy consumption is given as a function of income, energy prices, financial development, and foreign direct investments. The results of the empirical analysis show that all three different dimensions of financial development (banking sector, bond market, and capital market) have a positive effect on the share of renewable energy consumption. Additionally, our results show that capital market development does not influence renewable energy consumption in the new EU Member States. Our empirical results give valuable insights into how best to deploy capital in the renewable sector, in order to provide cost-competitive options to customers, with the final objective of expanding higher value-added services.

Nevertheless, Dunaliella salina has also a high content in lipids, including polar lipids, which are suitable for nutraceutical/cosmeceutical applications. This work proposes a sustainable process to maximise the potential of Dunaliella salina for the production of distinct fractions of carotenoids, glycerol, polar lipids and proteins, which may contribute to improve the revenues of the microalgae industry. In this work, extraction with non-hazardous solvents and organic solvent nanofiltration are integrated, in order to obtain added-value products and glycerol. Also, aiming to separate carotenoids from glycerides, a saponification process is proposed. High overall recoveries were obtained for carotenoids (85%), glycerol (86%), polar lipids (94%) and proteins (95%). In order to evaluate the profitability of the proposed biorefinery, an economic assessment was accomplished. Both CAPEX and OPEX (Capital and Operating expenditure) were calculated, likewise the Return of Investment (ROI)."

Redirection of investment flows to renewable energy technologies (RETs) is paramount to achieve the goals set in global climate agreement. The Turkish government is determined to attract investment in RETs for cleaner energy production and sustainable socio-economic development in Turkey. However, it is very challenging to substitute environmentally harmful traditional energy systems with renewable energy production and supply. Investing in and developing renewable energy projects (REPs) are posed to various inherent risks. Assessment and analysis of risk factors of renewable energy investments (REIs) are indispensable for a practical and profound policy guideline for mitigation. This study provides a Multi-Criteria Decision Methodology (MCDM) based three-stage decision framework to assess and examine the risk factors of REIs in Turkey. The first stage is the identification of risk factors of REI using the Delphi method. The second stage is the assessment of identified risk factors of REI by using the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP). The third stage is the evaluation and prioritization of strategies to overcome risk factors of REI projects by using Fuzzy Weighted Aggregated Sum Product Assessment (FWASPAS). The Delphi method unveiled 6 major risk factors with 23 sub-risk factors. Results of AHP analysis unfolded economic & business risk as a major risk factor. The FWASPAS analysis concluded a comprehensive and explicit explanation of the RET choices to be the most suitable of six strategies to deal with the investment risk factors for sustainable development in Turkey.

363,The impact of natural resource depletion on energy use and CO2 emission in Belt & Road Initiative countries: A cross-country analysis,"Hussain, Jamal; Khan, Anwar; Zhou, Kui","We employ STIRPAT (stochastic impact of regression on population, affluence, and technology) model to investigate the impact of natural resource depletion on energy use and carbon dioxide emissions for a panel of 56 ""Belt & Road Initiative"" (BRI) countries over 1990-2014. We utilize the Augmented Mean Group (AMG) panel estimator and Common Correlated Effects Mean Group (CCEMG) estimator for estimating our model. The results indicate that increasing natural resource depletion increases CO2 emissions and energy use, which shows that a 1% increase in natural resource depletion for our sample of BRI countries will increase CO2 emissions and energy use by 0.0286% and 0.0117%, respectively. To check the causal relationship among our variables, we employ the VECM Granger causality test. The causality results underscore feedback hypothetical links among CO2 emissions, energy use, economic growth, natural resource depletion, urbanization, and trade openness in the long run. Our results show a significant cross-sectional dependence and heterogeneity. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."
364,A patient with pulmonary hypertension waiting for donor lungs during the pandemic: 194 days on extracorporeal life support including 143 days on pulmonary artery to left atrium shunt,"Martin Balik,Jan Rulisek,Marek Flaksa,Michal Porizka,Frantisek Mosna,Jaroslav Lindner,Samuel Heller,Jan Belohlavek,Theodor Adla,Christof Schmid,Alois Philipp,Jan Havlin,Jan Burkert,Robert Lischke,Martin Balik,Jan Rulisek,Marek Flaksa,Michal Porizka,Frantisek Mosna,Jaroslav Lindner,Samuel Heller,Jan Belohlavek,Theodor Adla,Christof Schmid,Alois Philipp,Jan Havlin,Jan Burkert,Robert Lischke","Patients with pulmonary hypertension and end-stage lung disease are fraught with high mortality while on a waiting list for lung transplant. With sometimes rapid deterioration they may require veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VA-ECMO) as an immediate life-saving technique, which is a time-limited solution. The technique of pulmonary artery to left atrium (PA-LA) shunt fitted with an oxygenator enables bridging the patient to transplant for a longer time period. This low-resistance paracorporeal pumpless lung assist device allows for de-adaptation of the right ventricle back to lower afterload before the lung transplantation is carried out. The PA-LA shunt with an oxygenator also conveys a risk of multiple complications with reported median of 10-26 days until transplant. We report a case of pulmonary capillary hemangiomatosis in a 35-year-old female who had to wait for donor lungs during the pandemic of SARS-CoV-2 for 143 days on PA-LA shunt with oxygenator following 51 days on VA-ECMO. The extremely long course associated with multiple complications including three cerebral embolisms, episodes of sepsis and ingrowth of the return cannula into the left ventricular wall gives insight into the limits of this bridging technique."
365,Sub-micro scale cell segmentation using deep learning,"Volkan Müjdat Tiryaki,Virginia M Ayres,Ijaz Ahmed,David I Shreiber,Volkan Müjdat Tiryaki,Virginia M Ayres,Ijaz Ahmed,David I Shreiber","Automated cell segmentation is key for rapid and accurate investigation of cell responses. As instrumentation resolving power increases, clear delineation of newly revealed cellular features at the submicron through nanoscale becomes important. Reliance on the manual investigation of myriad small features retards investigation; however, use of deep learning methods has great potential to reveal cell features both at high accuracy and high speed, which may lead to new discoveries in the near term. In this study, semantic cell segmentation systems were investigated by implementing fully convolutional neural networks called U-nets for the segmentation of astrocytes cultured on poly-l-lysine-functionalized planar glass. The network hyperparameters were determined by changing the number of network layers, loss functions, and input image modalities. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) images were selected for investigation as these are inherently nanoscale and are also dimensional. AFM height, deflection, and friction images were used as inputs separately and together, and the segmentation performances were investigated on five-fold cross-validation data. Transfer learning methods, including VGG16, VGG19, and Xception, were used to improve cell segmentation performance. We find that AFM height images inherit more discriminative features than AFM deflection and AFM friction images for cell segmentation. When transfer-learning methods are applied, statistically significant segmentation performance improvements are observed. Segmentation performance was compared to classical image processing algorithms and other algorithms in use by considering both AFM and electron microscopy segmentation. An accuracy of 0.9849, Matthews correlation coefficient of 0.9218, and Dice's similarity coefficient of 0.9306 were obtained on the AFM test images. Performance evaluations show that the proposed system can be successfully used for AFM cell segmentation with high precision."
366,Impact of institutional quality on environment and energy consumption: evidence from developing world,"Azam, Muhammad; Liu, Liu; Ahmad, Najid","This study aimed to examine the role of institutional quality on environment and energy consumption for 66 developing countries by using data from 1991 to 2017. Different environmental indicators such as CO2 emissions, CH4 emissions, forest area, organic water pollutants, and energy consumption. The paper constructs institutional quality index by covering three main aspects: political stability, administrative capacity, and democratic accountability. System generalized method of moments results reveal that institutional quality has a positive impact on most of the environmental indicators such as CO2 emissions, CH4 emissions, and forest area. Institutional quality was having a positive impact on energy consumption based on oil and fossil fuel resources. Furthermore, it results in a signal that economic globalization has not increased environmental quality over time in developing countries."

In this paper, we present the case of a healthy 12-year-old male patient admitted in our emergency room for acute scrotum, in whom diagnosis of torsion of a cystic paradidymis was suggested at color-Doppler US. Surgical exploration after ultrasound examination revealed a cystic paradidymis (Giraldes' organ) (PC) torsion. Immunohistochemical investigations were also performed after cyst excision to confirm the diagnosis. In our experience this is a very rare condition and appears to be only the third case reported in literature and the only one with pre-operative ultrasound (US) images demonstrating the presence of the cyst and its twisted pedicle."
368,Automated detection of diabetic retinopathy using custom convolutional neural network,"Saleh Albahli,Ghulam Nabi Ahmad Hassan Yar,Saleh Albahli,Ghulam Nabi Ahmad Hassan Yar","Diabetic retinopathy is an eye deficiency that affects retina as a result of the patient having diabetes mellitus caused by high sugar levels, which may eventually lead to macular edema. The objective of this study is to design and compare several deep learning models that detect severity of diabetic retinopathy, determine risk of leading to macular edema, and segment different types of disease patterns using retina images. Indian Diabetic Retinopathy Image Dataset (IDRiD) dataset was used for disease grading and segmentation. Since images of the dataset have different brightness and contrast, we employed three techniques for generating processed images from the original images, which include brightness, color and, contrast (BCC) enhancing, color jitters (CJ), and contrast limited adaptive histogram equalization (CLAHE). After image preporcessing, we used pre-trained ResNet50, VGG16, and VGG19 models on these different preprocessed images both for determining the severity of the retinopathy and also the chances of macular edema. UNet was also applied to segment different types of diseases. To train and test these models, image dataset was divided into training, testing, and validation data at 70%, 20%, and 10% ratios, respectively. During model training, data augmentation method was also applied to increase the number of training images. Study results show that for detecting the severity of retinopathy and macular edema, ResNet50 showed the best accuracy using BCC and original images with an accuracy of 60.2% and 82.5%, respectively, on validation dataset. In segmenting different types of diseases, UNet yielded the highest testing accuracy of 65.22% and 91.09% for microaneurysms and hard exudates using BCC images, 84.83% for optic disc using CJ images, 59.35% and 89.69% for hemorrhages and soft exudates using CLAHE images, respectively. Thus, image preprocessing can play an important role to improve efficacy and performance of deep learning models."
369,Revisiting the Environmental Kuznets Curve in Malaysia: The role of globalization in sustainable environment,"Suki, Norazah Mohd; Sharif, Arshian; Afshan, Sahar; Suki, Norbayah Mohd","The present study examines the presence of Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) in Malaysia by investigating impact of globalization (including overall, social, economic and political) on ecological footprint in the Malaysian economy using quarterly data from 1970 to 2018. This research utilizes the Quantile Autoregressive Distributed Lag (QARDL) method. This approach is useful as it depicts the causality patterns through various quantiles of the globalization and environmental degradation by providing more comprehensive explanations of the over-all dependence among the aforementioned variables almost ignored by the traditional approach (for instance ARDL and OLS). The outcomes of QARDL showed that the error correction coefficient is significant with the anticipated negative sign for all quantiles. This outcome provides evidence on the presence of considerable return to the long-run equilibrium association between the factors of interest and environmental degradation. Overall, the results recommended that overall globalization and economic globalization enhance the level of environmental degradation in the long run, however, political and social globalization help to reduce the level of environmental degradation in the long term. Moreover, the results of QARDL also confirmed the existence of inverted UShape curve in the Malaysian economy. In the shorter-run period, this study found a significant negative impact of overall globalization and political globalization on environmental degradation. The results recommended that the Malaysian government and policymakers need to give more attention to social and political globalization to achieve the goals of sustainable environment in the long-run equilibrium.

370,Global Indicators of Sustainable Development: Evaluation of the Influence of the Human Development Index on Consumption and Quality of Energy,"Yumashev, Alexei; Slusarczyk, Beata; Kondrashev, Sergey; Mikhaylov, Alexey","The article explores the impact of the quality and volume of energy consumption of the population on the human development index using a sample of a number of countries as an example. The hypothesis concerning the relationship between the amount of energy consumed, the human development index (HDI), and the environment (CO2 emissions into the atmosphere) has been verified. The study results show that the size and rating of the HDI are influenced by such factors as urbanization growth, gross domestic product (GDP), gross national income (GNI) per capita, the share of ""clean"" energy consumption by the population and business in total energy consumption, the level of socio-economic development, and R&D expenses. In the course of building the model, the recommendations by the United Nations (UN) and the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) were used. The results show that the volume of energy consumption not only affects the human development index in a particular country, but is also an important factor in determining the level of sustainable development. The results, obtained in the course of the study and described in the article, may be applicable in the practice of research related to the assessment of human development and sustainable development."
371,Developments of Economic Growth and Employment in Bioeconomy Sectors across the EU,"Ronzon, Tevecia; Piotrowski, Stephan; Tamosiunas, Saulius; Dammer, Lara; Carus, Michael; M'barek, Robert","The development of the bioeconomy-or the substitution of fossil-based materials and energy by bio-based solutions-is considered a strategic economic orientation by the European Commission and its Green Deal. This paper presents a methodology to monitor the contribution of the bioeconomy to jobs and growth within the European Union (EU) and its Member States. Classified as an ''output-based'' approach, the methodology relies on expert estimations of the biomass content of the bio-based materials produced in the EU and the subsequent calculation of ''sectoral'' bio-based shares by using Eurostat statistics on the production of manufactured goods (prom). Sectoral shares are applied to indicators of employment, and value added is reported in Eurostat-Structural business statistics. This paper updates the methodology and time series presented in 2018. The bioeconomy of the EU (post-Brexit composition) employed around 17.5 million people and generated Euro614 billion of value added in 2017. The study evidences structural differences between EU national bioeconomies, which become more pronounced over time, especially in terms of the level of apparent labour productivity of national bioeconomies. Finally, this paper describes cases of transition over the 2008-2017 period."
372,"Transport CO(2)emissions, drivers, and mitigation: an empirical investigation in India","Ahmed, Zahoor; Ali, Sajid; Saud, Shah; Shahzad, Syed Jawad Hussain","India has one of the world's largest transport networks, with the dominant share being road transportation. India's transport sector consumes oil products for more than 95% of its energy needs and is a significant contributor to environmental deterioration in urban areas. Therefore, we examine the driving factors of transport CO(2)emissions in India, incorporating road transport energy, economic growth, industrialization, urbanization, oil prices, and road infrastructure, over the period 1980 to 2015. The findings indicate that economic growth and road sector energy use cause an upsurge in transport emissions. Likewise, industrialization and road infrastructure stimulate transport emissions. Urbanization mitigates transport emissions, while oil prices have no influence on transport emissions. One-way causality is shown from economic growth, urbanization, and road sector energy to transport emissions. Finally, suitable policy implications are proposed to reduce transport CO(2)emissions for a sustainable environment."
373,Pathways for Low-Carbon Transition of the Steel Industry-A Swedish Case Study,"Toktarova, Alla; Karlsson, Ida; Rootzen, Johan; Goransson, Lisa; Odenberger, Mikael; Johnsson, Filip","The concept of techno-economic pathways is used to investigate the potential implementation of CO(2)abatement measures over time towards zero-emission steelmaking in Sweden. The following mitigation measures are investigated and combined in three pathways: top gas recycling blast furnace (TGRBF); carbon capture and storage (CCS); substitution of pulverized coal injection (PCI) with biomass; hydrogen direct reduction of iron ore (H-DR); and electric arc furnace (EAF), where fossil fuels are replaced with biomass. The results show that CCS in combination with biomass substitution in the blast furnace and a replacement primary steel production plant with EAF with biomass (Pathway 1) yield CO(2)emission reductions of 83% in 2045 compared to CO(2)emissions with current steel process configurations. Electrification of the primary steel production in terms of H-DR/EAF process (Pathway 2), could result in almost fossil-free steel production, and Sweden could achieve a 10% reduction in total CO(2)emissions. Finally, (Pathway 3) we show that increased production of hot briquetted iron pellets (HBI), could lead to decarbonization of the steel industry outside Sweden, assuming that the exported HBI will be converted via EAF and the receiving country has a decarbonized power sector."
374,"Aggression, rank and power: why hens (and other animals) do not always peck according to their strength","Rebecca J Lewis,Rebecca J Lewis","Thorlief Schjelderup-Ebbe's seminal paper on the 'pecking' order of chickens inspired numerous ethologists to research and debate the phenomenon of dominance. The expansion of dominance to the broader concept of power facilitated disentangling aggression, strength, rank and power. Aggression is only one means of coercing other individuals, and can sometimes highlight a lack of power. The fitness advantages of aggression may only outweigh the costs during periods of uncertainty. Effective instruments of power also include incentives and refusals to act. Moreover, the stability of the power relationship might vary with the instruments used if different means of power vary in the number and types of outcomes achieved, as well as the speed of accomplishing those outcomes. In well-established relationships, actions or physiological responses in the subordinate individual may even be the only indicator of a power differential. A focus on strength, aggression and fighting provides an incomplete understanding of the power landscape that individuals actually experience. Multiple methods for constructing hierarchies exist but greater attention to the implications of the types of data used in these constructions is needed. Many shifts in our understanding of power were foreshadowed in Schjelderup-Ebbe's discussion about deviations from the linear hierarchy in chickens. This article is part of the theme issue 'The centennial of the pecking order: current state and future prospects for the study of dominance hierarchies'."

We apply the ""web of information"" model of clinical translation to both approaches to argue firstly that tests of treatments aiming to achieve clinically meaningful outcomes should remain simple, and secondly, that building clinically-meaningful treatments should be kept separate from public health policy which means promoting wide-reaching action against risk factors now with available information."
376,"A data-driven approach for multi-scale GIS-based building energy modeling for analysis, planning and support decision making","Ali, Usman; Shamsi, Mohammad Haris; Bohacek, Mark; Purcell, Karl; Hoare, Cathal; Mangina, Eleni; O'Donnell, James","Urban planners, local authorities, and energy policymakers often develop strategic sustainable energy plans for the urban building stock in order to minimize overall energy consumption and emissions. Planning at such scales could be informed by building stock modeling using existing building data and Geographic Information System-based mapping. However, implementing these processes involves several issues, namely, data availability, data inconsistency, data scalability, data integration, geocoding, and data privacy. This research addresses the aforementioned information challenges by proposing a generalized integrated methodology that implements bottom-up, data-driven, and spatial modeling approaches for multi-scale Geographic Information System mapping of building energy modeling. This study uses the Irish building stock to map building energy performance at multiple scales. The generalized data-driven methodology uses approximately 650,000 Irish Energy Performance Certificates buildings data to predict more than 2 million buildings' energy performance. In this case, the approach delivers a prediction accuracy of 88% using deep learning algorithms. These prediction results are then used for spatial modeling at multiple scales from the individual building level to a national level. Furthermore, these maps are coupled with available spatial resources (social, economic, or environmental data) for energy planning, analysis, and support decision-making. The modeling results identify clusters of buildings that have a significant potential for energy savings within any specific region. Geographic Information System-based modeling aids stakeholders in identifying priority areas for implementing energy efficiency measures. Furthermore, the stakeholders could target local communities for retrofit campaigns, which would enhance the implementation of sustainable energy policy decisions."
377,Variability and specificity of bone cutting mark properties in cases involving stabbing with knives,"Martin Baiker-Sørensen,Koen Herlaar,Martin Baiker-Sørensen,Koen Herlaar","Sharp force traumas are frequently encountered in stabbing crime victims. During an examination, the properties of cutting marks in bones are compared with the properties of suspect tools, particularly knives. Therefore, the variation and specificity of knife and cutting mark properties must be known. This article provides the variability and specificity of a set of knife blade and cutting mark properties. Plain and serrated knives are used to create experimental cutting marks in porcine ribs, knife properties are derived from surface acquisitions of the blades and mark properties from Micro-CT data. We consider two conditions, automated stabbing using a motorized stage and manual stabbing. In addition, we study the influence of maceration on marks. For knives, the blade edge angle, blade thickness, and bevel height, and for cutting marks, the shape, the wall angle, the width, and the bevel height are determined and compared. The results show that the relationship between corresponding properties of blades and marks depends on the knife type. For plain knives, the width and wall angle of the marks are dependent on the mark depth and are significantly smaller than the blade properties edge angle and width. For serrated knives, this is not the case. The mark shape only provides slight support for a knife type for marks deeper than the blade bevel height. In conclusion, mark properties are only specific for a particular knife brand and model if the blade properties differ significantly and assuming a specific knife type."

The objective of our study was to summarize clinical characteristics and outcomes of infant patients with nontuberculous mycobacterial pulmonary infection via systematic literature review to identify common diagnostic and treatment regimens for this infection in infants. A search of MEDLINE and PubMed databases in October 2019 using MeSH search terms ""infant,"" ""NTM,"" ""pulmonary,"" and ""Mycobacterium abscessus"" yielded 139 articles. Inclusion criteria were i) English-language studies including cases and case series with ii) established nontuberculous mycobacterial pulmonary infection in iii) a patient population of infants no older than 24 months. Patients with cystic fibrosis and any study which did not contain relevant information such as infection and age were excluded. This yielded data on 37 patients extracted from 28 studies analyzed. The most common strain was Mycobacterium avium complex, isolated in 56.8% of patient diagnoses. Bronchoscopy/thoracoscopy with a subsequent culture were the most common diagnostic techniques, utilized in 64.9% of cases. Drug therapeutic treatment was utilized in 86% of cases, with a median of three drugs administered. Notable limitations of this study are the small sample size and its retrospective nature, which relies on information reported in previous case studies. Although there is limited formal clinician consensus on the treatment of NTM pulmonary infection and how it may differ in an infant population, our findings indicate an informal consensus typically involving diagnostic lung specimen culture and antibiotic therapy."
379,Prenatal air pollution exposure and neonatal health,"Alessandro Palma,Inna Petrunyk,Daniela Vuri,Alessandro Palma,Inna Petrunyk,Daniela Vuri","Air pollution has been shown to have adverse effects on many health outcomes including respiratory effects, cardiovascular effects, and mortality. However, evidence on the effects of prenatal exposure is still limited. We investigate the causal impact of prenatal exposure to air pollution on neonatal health in Italy in the 2000s. We exploit variation in rainfall shocks to instrument for non-random air pollution exposure. Our empirical setting combines detailed information on mother's residential location from birth certificates with PM10 concentrations from air pollution monitors. Ten additional units in the average PM10 level (approximately one standard deviation) would decrease birth weight by about 0.5% and gestational age by 0.16%; it would increase the prevalence of low birth weight by 22% and of preterm birth by 16%. The effects are stronger in magnitude for third trimester exposure and for less educated mothers. These findings suggest that the health impacts of air pollution on newborns are unequally distributed in the population."

Over the past decade the tools, technology, and strategies used to assess and manage pediatric respiratory and airway emergencies have evolved, and evidence regarding their use continues to grow.NAEMSP recommends:Methods and tools used to properly size pediatric equipment for ages ranging from newborns to adolescents should be available to all EMS clinicians. All pediatric equipment should be routinely checked and clearly identifiable in EMS equipment supply bags and vehicles.EMS agencies should train and equip their clinicians with age-appropriate pulse oximetry and capnography equipment to aid in the assessment and management of pediatric respiratory distress and airway emergencies.EMS agencies should emphasize noninvasive positive pressure ventilation and effective bag-valve-mask ventilation strategies in children.Supraglottic airways can be used as primary or secondary airway management interventions for pediatric respiratory failure and cardiac arrest in the EMS setting.Pediatric endotracheal intubation has unclear benefit in the EMS setting. Advanced approaches to pediatric ETI including drug-assisted airway management, apneic oxygenation, and use of direct and video laryngoscopy require further research to more clearly define their risks and benefits prior to widespread implementation.If considering the use of pediatric endotracheal intubation, the EMS medical director must ensure the program provides pediatric-specific initial training and ongoing competency and quality management activities to ensure that EMS clinicians attain and maintain mastery of the intervention.Paramedic use of direct laryngoscopy paired with Magill forceps to facilitate foreign body removal in the pediatric patient should be maintained even when pediatric endotracheal intubation is not approved as a local clinical intervention."

383,Techno-economic analysis and life cycle assessment for electrochemical ammonia production using proton conducting membrane,"Gomez, Jamie R.; Baca, John; Garzon, Fernando","Green ammonia production is facing increasing interest on a global scale as a hydrogen carrier for power generation as well as fertilizer for food production. The conventional Haber-Bosch method for ammonia synthesis is energy demanding, requires high purity hydrogen, and is based on fossil fuels. A preliminary techno-economic model for electrochemical ammonia synthesis at near ambient pressure using feed rates of 32 metric ton/day for hydrogen and 135 metric ton/day for nitrogen is presented in this study. Various pathways using different methods for nitrogen generation and hydrogen production were investigated to gain insight into added energy savings per metric ton of ammonia. Electrochemical synthesis using electrolysis for hydrogen and cryogenic nitrogen was found to be a potentially viable pathway for green ammonia. The profitability metrics including discounted cash flow rate of return, net present value and discounted payback period were estimated to be 8%, $40 MM, and 4-6 years respectively for this pathway. The cost of electricity, conversion rate, and conversion efficiency dominate the tonnage cost of ammonia and were used to assess the feasibility of the model. A life cycle assessment was also conducted to assess the environmental impact of a well to product ammonia process. (C) 2019 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The low-temperature cracking, moisture susceptibility, fatigue cracking, and rutting resistance of asphalt concrete are the most common deficiencies of rejuvenated reclaimed asphalt mixtures. Therefore, to analyze the mechanical characteristics, different experimental tests including Marshall Stability, indirect tensile strength, tensile strength ratio, semi-circular bending (at low and intermediate temperatures) are applied, and their results are taken into consideration as determinate mechanical performances in optimizing the mixture. The percentage of landfill embedment, saving in energy consumption, and the amounts of harmful emissions are utilized to compare the environmental influences of eco-friendly and the virgin mixtures. Drawing the results of experimental tests and statistical analysis (i.e., ANOVA, and Tukey pairwise comparison), the mechanical characteristics of mixtures containing various content of reclaimed asphalt pavements (i.e., 30%, 60%, and 100%), waste engine oil, and supplementary binder modified with crumb-rubber simultaneously are better than or equal to that of the conventional mixture. The environmental analysis reveals that the refined mixture is by far valuable than the virgin mixture. The proposed asphalt concrete incorporating the 100% of reclaimed asphalt pavements significantly reduces the pollution generated by the production and preparation of materials to manufacture asphalt mixture. Moreover, the energy consumed to manufacture, the percentage of landfill embedment, and the rate of economic conservation considerably decrease in suggested asphalt concretes containing different content of reclaimed asphalt pavements in comparison with the virgin mixture. This environmental Protection of the examined asphalt concretes enhances as the content of reclaimed asphalt pavements increases. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."
385,Does Internet use reduce chemical fertilizer use? Evidence from rural households in China,"Yuan, Fang; Tang, Kai; Shi, Qinghua","Although numerous studies have explored various impacts of Internet use, few have investigated the linkage between Internet use and chemical fertilizer use in developing economies. This study examines the influences of Internet use and related promotion policy on chemical fertilizer use based on a nationwide dataset including China's 7766 rural households. The baseline regression results show that Internet use reduced chemical fertilizer use significantly. The mechanism analysis unveils the mediation role of human capital; Internet use increased farmers' human capital and then reduced chemical fertilizer use. In addition, the difference-in-difference method is employed to examine the effects of Internet promotion policy and the findings reveal that the promotion policy could help reduce farmers' use of chemical fertilizer. Finally, both propensity score matching-DID model and a two-stage instrumental variable model are used to address potential endogeneity issues associated with Internet use, and results indicate that the empirical results are robust. Our findings suggest that improving the availability of broadband access in a rural area, promoting Internet-related training and education, and more government's investment in rural ICTs infrastructure can contribute to the reduction of chemical fertilizer use."

The local flora and fauna are protected by three conservation units (Pedra Branca State Park, Prainha Municipal Natural Park and Guaratiba State Biological Reserve) and one biological station (Fiocruz Atlantic Forest Biological Station-EFMA). Here, we provide an updated list of the bat fauna for the remnant. The results are based on samplings at EFMA and literature data from Pedra Branca State Park and Prainha Natural Park. The three sampling sites combined resulted in 31 species, 23 genera and four families. Phyllostomidae was the richest family with 24 species, followed by Vespertilionidae with five species (3%) and Molossidae and Noctilionidae with one species. The local bat fauna was predominantly composed of species with a broad geographic distribution."
387,Proposed mechanism for rare thrombotic events after use of some Covid-19 vaccines,"Peter A Feldman,Peter A Feldman","Administration of AstraZeneca/Oxford and Johnson & Johnson/Janssen Covid-19 vaccines which use an adenovirus vector for DNA delivery has been associated with very rare thromboembolic complications coupled with an immune response to platelet factor 4 protein. The cause of this has not yet been identified. It is known that binding of coagulation factor proteins to the surface of some adenoviruses can protect their function. Here I propose that the thromboembolic events are caused by impairment of coagulation factor X binding to the virus capsid. The unprotected capsid then stimulates an immune response leading to platelet activation, increased thrombogenicity and formation of an antibody complex with platelet factor 4. Impaired binding of factor X may be due to an undiagnosed mutation in affected individuals. Options to test this mechanism experimentally and potential remedial actions to resolve the hazard are described. This mechanism offers a remedial route to address concerns about the safety of these vaccines, which are otherwise well-positioned to deliver global Covid-19 immunity across diverse healthcare economies."
388,Characterization of end-of-life LED lamps for the recovery of precious metals and rare earth elements,"Rebello, Rafaela Zamprogno; Dias Carneiro Lima, Maria Tereza Weitzel; Yamane, Luciana Harue; Siman, Renato Ribeiro","LED (Light Emitting Diode) lamps have been replacing conventional light bulbs (fluorescent and incandescent) due to their lifetime, luminescence power, and energy saving, and thus, the generation of end-of-life LED lamps is increasing. Unpublished data on their composition, focusing in the precious metals and rare earth elements, is presented and is extremely important for future studies involving recycling processes. From samples comminuted in ring mills, loss-on-ignition as well as digestion in aqua regia and nitric acid were used. The results showed that LED lamps had 8 wt.% and 14 wt.% of inorganics, 34 wt.% and 36 wt.% of polymers, and 50 wt.% and 58 wt.% of metals when leached by aqua regia and nitric acid, respectively. Two traditional e-waste leaching agents were used for comparison purposes, and although aqua regia was reported as efficient for the leaching of precious metals, rare earth elements were only verified for leaching with nitric acid. Antimony, silver, aluminum, and copper presented statistically significant differences between the two leaching agents used. The characterization also allowed for identifying the presence of arsenic, which is considered a harmful substance to health. Compared to other types of lamps (fluorescent and incandescent), only LED lamps contain gold, which makes them economically attractive. In this sense, it was concluded that LED lamps must be recycled both from the environmental point of view, regarding the presence of arsenic and the increasing waste generation, and the economic point of view, due to the presence of critical metals and recovery potential."
389,Does trade matter for environmental degradation in developing countries? New evidence in the context of export product diversification,"Can, Muhlis; Dogan, Buhari; Saboori, Behnaz","Global warming is a serious problem facing the world today. To minimize it, scholars are trying to find the reasons behind increasing CO2 emissions. This study examines the effects of overall export product diversification, extensive margin, and intensive margin on CO2 emissions as indicators of environmental degradation in 84 developing countries for the period of 1971-2014 in the context of the environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) hypothesis using three estimators, namely, autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) bounds test, dynamic ordinary least squares (DOLS), and fully modified ordinary least squares (FMOLS). The empirical findings reveal that EKC hypothesis is valid. The overall empirical findings from various approaches show that overall diversification, extensive margin, and intensive margin have a positive and significant effect on CO2 emissions."
390,Transforming mutations in the development of pathogenic B cell clones and autoantibodies,"Joanne H Reed,Joanne H Reed","Autoimmune diseases are characterized by serum autoantibodies, some of which are pathogenic, causing severe manifestations and organ injury. However, autoantibodies of the same antigenic reactivity are also present in the serum of asymptomatic people years before they develop any clinical signs of autoimmunity. Autoantibodies can arise during multiple stages of B cell development, and various genetic and environmental factors drive their production. However, what drives the development of pathogenic autoantibodies is poorly understood. Advances in single-cell technology have enabled the deep analysis of rare B cell clones producing pathogenic autoantibodies responsible for vasculitis in patients with primary Sjögren's syndrome complicated by mixed cryoglobulinaemia. These findings demonstrated a cascade of genetic events involving stereotypic immunoglobulin V(D)J recombination and transforming somatic mutations in lymphoma genes and V(D)J regions that disrupted antibody quality control mechanisms and decreased autoantibody solubility. Most studies consider V(D)J mutations that enhance autoantibody affinity to drive pathology; however, V(D)J mutations that increase autoantibody propensity to form insoluble complexes could be a major contributor to autoantibody pathogenicity. Defining the molecular characteristics of pathogenic autoantibodies and failed tolerance checkpoints driving their formation will improve prognostication, enabling early treatment to prevent escalating organ damage and B cell malignancy."
391,Feline XRCC4 undergoes rapid Ku-dependent recruitment to DNA damage sites,"Manabu Koike,Yasutomo Yutoku,Aki Koike,Manabu Koike,Yasutomo Yutoku,Aki Koike","Radiation and chemotherapy resistance remain some of the greatest challenges in human and veterinary cancer therapies. XRCC4, an essential molecule for nonhomologous end joining repair, is a promising target for radiosensitizers. Genetic variants and mutations of XRCC4 contribute to cancer susceptibility, and XRCC4 is also the causative gene of microcephalic primordial dwarfism (MPD) in humans. The development of clinically effective molecular-targeted drugs requires accurate understanding of the functions and regulatory mechanisms of XRCC4. In this study, we cloned and sequenced the cDNA of feline XRCC4. Comparative analysis indicated that sequences and post-translational modification sites that are predicted to be involved in regulating the localization of human XRCC4, including the nuclear localization signal, are mostly conserved in feline XRCC4. All examined target amino acids responsible for human MPD are completely conserved in feline XRCC4. Furthermore, we found that the localization of feline XRCC4 dynamically changes during the cell cycle. Soon after irradiation, feline XRCC4 accumulated at laser-induced DNA double-strand break (DSB) sites in both the interphase and mitotic phase, and this accumulation was dependent on the presence of Ku. Additionally, XRCC4 superfamily proteins XLF and PAXX accumulated at the DSB sites. Collectively, these findings suggest that mechanisms regulating the spatiotemporal localization of XRCC4 are crucial for XRCC4 function in humans and cats. Our findings contribute to elucidating the functions of XRCC4 and the role of abnormal XRCC4 in diseases, including cancers and MPD, and may help in developing XRCC4-targeted drugs, such as radiosensitizers, for humans and cats."

Therefore, revealing the molecular mechanisms of stem cell aging will set new directions for the therapeutic application of stem cells, the study of aging mechanisms, and the prevention and treatment of aging-related diseases. This review comprehensively describes the molecular mechanisms related to stem cell aging and provides the basis for further investigations aimed at developing new anti-stem cell aging strategies and promoting the clinical application of stem cells."
393,"Impact of urbanization, economic growth, and population size on residential carbon emissions in the SAARC countries","Anser, Muhammad Khalid; Alharthi, Majed; Aziz, Babar; Wasim, Sarah","This study attempts to analyse the influence of urbanization, economic growth, and population size on residential carbon emissions in the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) member nations for the period 1994 to 2013. To do so, we employ an augmented STIRPAT model in an ecological analytic framework with a fixed effect regression model that incorporates Driscoll and Kraay standard errors. The results show that population size and per capita GDP are leading drivers of high carbon emissions in the SAARC countries. The empirical results show that a U-shaped relationship exists between urbanization and residential carbon emissions: residential carbon emissions initially decrease with an increase in urbanization, reach a turning point at 25.33% and then increase with urbanization. Thus, our findings suggest a need for stronger national policies to control the impact of urbanization and population growth on residential carbon emissions in the SAARC member countries.

394,Responses of ecosystem services to natural and anthropogenic forcings: A spatial regression based assessment in the world's largest mangrove ecosystem,"Sannigrahi, Srikanta; Zhang, Qi; Pilla, Francesco; Joshi, Pawan Kumar; Basu, Bidroha; Keesstra, Saskia; Roy, P. S.; Wang, Ying; Sutton, Paul C.; Chakraborti, Suman; Paul, Saikat Kumar; Sen, Somnath","Most of the Earth's Ecosystem Services (ESs) have experienced a decreasing trend in the last few decades, primarily due to increasing human dominance in the natural environment. Identification and categorization of factors that affect the provision of ESs from global to local scales are challenging. This study makes an effort to identify the key driving factors and examine their effects on different ESs in the Sundarbans region, India. We carry out the analysis following five successive steps: (1) quantifying biophysical and economic values of ESs using three valuation approaches; (2) identifying six major driving forces on ESs; (3) categorizing principal data components with dimensionality reduction; (4) constructing multivariate regression models with variance partitioning; (5) implementing six spatial regression models to examine the causal effects of natural and anthropogenic forcings on ESs. Results show that climatic factors, biophysical factors, and environmental stressors significantly affect the ESs. Among the six driving factors, climate factors are highly associated with the ESs variation and explain the maximum model variances (R-2 = 0.75-0.81). Socioeconomic (R-2 = 0.44-0.66) and development R-2 = 27-0.44) factors have weak to moderate effects on the ESs. Furthermore, the joint effects of the driving factors are much higher than their individual effects. Among the six spatial regression models, Geographical Weighted Regression (GWR) performs the most accurately and explains the maximum model variances. The proposed hybrid valuation method aggregates biophysical and economic estimates of ESs and addresses methodological biases existing in the valuation process. The presented framework can be generalized and applied to other ecosystems at different scales. The outcome of this study could be a reference for decision-makers, planners, land administrators in formulating a suitable action plan and adopting relevant management practices to improve the overall socio-ecological status of the region.

Most of the strains were sensitive to chloramphenicol, erythromycin, gentamycin, kanamycin, lincomycin, oxacillin, tetracycline, and trimethoprim. However, 23 strains exhibited potential phenotypic acquired resistance to erythromycin, lincomycin, and tetracycline. Based on breakpoint values for staphylococci from the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute, >30% of the isolates were resistant to ampicillin and penicillin G, but the population distributions in minimum inhibitory concentration tests were clearly different from those expected for acquired resistance. None of the strains exhibited clear α- or β-hemolytic activity. S. xylosus and S. pseudoxylosus exhibited salt tolerance on agar medium containing 20% and 22% (w/v) NaCl, respectively. S. xylosus and S. pseudoxylosus strains possessed protease and lipase activities, which were affected by the NaCl concentration. Protease activity of S. pseudoxylosus was strain-specific, but lipase activity might be a characteristic of both species. This study confirms the potential of both species for use in high-salt soybean fermentation, but the safety and technological properties of strains must be determined to select suitable starter candidates."
396,Waste-to-resources: Green preparation of magnetic biogas residues-based biochar for effective heavy metal removals,"Pan, Jingwen; Gao, Baoyu; Wang, Siyuan; Guo, Kangying; Xu, Xing; Yue, Qinyan","The agricultural wastes disposal and polluted water purification are always the key issues of environmental restoration. In this work, a magnetic biogas residue-based biochar (mBR-C) by direct pyrolysis and sonochemical method was prepared from biogas residue (BR). Response design methodology based on Box-Behnken design was used for the preparation parameters optimization. The characterization results identified that mBR-C had well-developed pore structure and surface area, which was beneficial to diffuse and capture heavy metal ions. Traces of toxic heavy metal in mBR-C was leached ((<)0.04 mg/L) through TCLP method, indicating the environmental safety of the magnetic biochar. Meanwhile, the mBR-C exhibited excellent solid-liquid separation efficiency because of its strong magnetism. The series of adsorption experiments indicated that mBR-C could capture Cu2+ and Pb2+ rapidly, and the maximum adsorption capacity for Cu2+ and Pb2+ was 75.76 and 181.82 mg/g, respectively, which was higher than some other biochars previously reported, mBR-C was further applied in the synthetic wastewater treatment, which could effectively purify at least 600 mL (150 BV) to meet emission standards. After several column adsorption-desorption cycles, the adsorption capacity could still reach 85%, implying that mBR-C has good reusability and stability. Overall, the mBR-C can be used as an eco-friendly, desirable, economic and recyclable biosorbent in heavy metal polluted water treatment, providing a new idea for a combination of biogas residue recycle and wastewater treatment.

397,Conspiracy Beliefs Are Associated with Lower Knowledge and Higher Anxiety Levels Regarding COVID-19 among Students at the University of Jordan,"Sallam, Malik; Dababseh, Deema; Yaseen, Alaa; Al-Haidar, Ayat; Ababneh, Nidaa A.; Bakri, Faris G.; Mahafzah, Azmi","The world has been afflicted heavily by the burden of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) that overwhelmed health care systems and caused severe economic and educational deficits, in addition to anxiety among the public. The main aim of this study was to evaluate the mutual effects of belief that the pandemic was the result of a conspiracy on knowledge and anxiety levels among students at the University of Jordan (UJ). An electronic-based survey was conducted between 29 March, 2020 and 31 March, 2020. The targeted population involved all undergraduate and postgraduate students from the health, scientific and humanities schools at UJ. Survey sections included 26 items on: socio-demographic information, knowledge and sources of information about the disease, attitude towards the false notion that COVID-19 stemmed from a conspiracy and items to assess the anxiety level among students during the quarantine period. The total number of participants was 1540 students. The mean age of study participants was 22 years and females predominated the study population (n = 1145, 74.4%). The majority of participants perceived the disease as moderately dangerous (n = 1079, 70.1%). Males, Jordanians and participants with lower income were more inclined to feel that COVID-19 is very dangerous. A lower level of knowledge and a higher level of anxiety about COVID-19 were associated with the belief that the disease is part of a conspiracy. Females and participants with lower income were more likely to believe that the disease is related to conspiracy. Belief in conspiracy regarding the origin of COVID-19 was associated with misinformation about the availability of a vaccine and the therapeutic use of antibiotics for COVID-19 treatment. The Ministry of Health in Jordan was the most common source of information about COVID-19 reported by the participants (n = 1018). The false belief that COVID-19 was the result of a global conspiracy could be the consequence of a lower level of knowledge about the virus and could lead to a higher level of anxiety, which should be considered in the awareness tools of various media platforms about the current pandemic."
398,Anxiety and depressive symptoms among adults with obesity and chronic pain: the role of anxiety sensitivity,"Brooke Y Kauffman,Andrew H Rogers,Lorra Garey,Michael J Zvolensky,Brooke Y Kauffman,Andrew H Rogers,Lorra Garey,Michael J Zvolensky","Obesity and chronic pain frequently co-occur, and this co-occurrence can have potential negative consequences, particularly as it relates to mental health. As such, there is a need to understand potential risk factors for poor mental health among this co-morbid population. Thus, the current study examined the predictive role of anxiety sensitivity (and its sub-facets) on anxiety and depressive symptoms among adults (82.5% female, Mage = 40.2 years, SD = 10.92) with obesity and chronic pain. Results revealed that greater levels of anxiety sensitivity were associated with greater levels of both anxiety and depressive symptoms, with medium to large effect sizes. Post hoc analyses also indicated that specific sub-facets of anxiety sensitivity (cognitive and social concerns) were significant predictors of the criterion variables. The current study highlights the potential clinical utility in targeting anxiety sensitivity among individuals with co-occurring obesity and chronic pain in the treatment of anxiety and depressive symptoms."
399,Optimal planning and operation of multi-carrier networked microgrids considering multi-energy hubs in distribution networks,"Ghanbari, Ali; Karimi, Hamid; Jadid, Shahram","In this paper, we propose a new scheme for designing multi-carrier networked microgrids. Various multi-energy carriers are utilized to form energy hubs which exchange energy with each other and the main electricity and gas networks. The proposed model considers renewable generation, diesel generators, fuel cells, energy storages, combined heat and powers, boilers, combined cooling heat and powers, and power to gas converters. The seasonal load patterns are considered to design the optimal capacity of combined cooling, heating, and powers. The main objective of the proposed model is to operate the integrated hubs with minimum cost, meet the consumer's required energies, reduce the emissions, and create a bi-directional interaction between electricity, and gas networks using power to gas converters. While all electrical, mechanical, and technical constraints are satisfied. To achieve these improvements, industrial and residential hubs interact with other multi-carrier microgrids to determine the optimal operation of hubs. The proposed model is tested on a standard case study and results show when hubs integrate about the total daily cost of each microgrid has been improved about 200 $. Besides, the thermal energy not supply in microgrid 4 has been improved from 4.61 MWh to 0.45 MWh. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."
400,Challenge accepted: uncovering the role of rare genetic variants in Alzheimer's disease,"Marzieh Khani,Elizabeth Gibbons,Jose Bras,Rita Guerreiro,Marzieh Khani,Elizabeth Gibbons,Jose Bras,Rita Guerreiro","The search for rare variants in Alzheimer's disease (AD) is usually deemed a high-risk - high-reward situation. The challenges associated with this endeavor are real. Still, the application of genome-wide technologies to large numbers of cases and controls or to small, well-characterized families has started to be fruitful.Rare variants associated with AD have been shown to increase risk or cause disease, but also to protect against the development of AD. All of these can potentially be targeted for the development of new drugs.Multiple independent studies have now shown associations of rare variants in NOTCH3, TREM2, SORL1, ABCA7, BIN1, CLU, NCK2, AKAP9, UNC5C, PLCG2, and ABI3 with AD and suggested that they may influence disease via multiple mechanisms. These genes have reported functions in the immune system, lipid metabolism, synaptic plasticity, and apoptosis. However, the main pathway emerging from the collective of genes harboring rare variants associated with AD is the Aβ pathway. Associations of rare variants in dozens of other genes have also been proposed, but have not yet been replicated in independent studies. Replication of this type of findings is one of the challenges associated with studying rare variants in complex diseases, such as AD. In this review, we discuss some of these primary challenges as well as possible solutions.Integrative approaches, the availability of large datasets and databases, and the development of new analytical methodologies will continue to produce new genes harboring rare variability impacting AD. In the future, more extensive and more diverse genetic studies, as well as studies of deeply characterized families, will enhance our understanding of disease pathogenesis and put us on the correct path for the development of successful drugs."

V.; Debele, Sisay E.; Zavala-Reyes, Juan C.; Barwise, Yendle; Tiwari, Arvind","The COVID-19 pandemic elicited a global response to limit associated mortality, with social distancing and lockdowns being imposed. In India, human activities were restricted from late March 2020. This 'anthropogenic emissions switch-of presented an opportunity to investigate impacts of COVID-19 mitigation measures on ambient air quality in five Indian cities (Chennai, Delhi, Hyderabad, Kolkata, and Mumbai), using in-situ measurements from 2015 to 2020. For each year, we isolated, analysed and compared fine particulate matter (PM2.5) concentration data from 25 March to 11 May, to elucidate the effects of the lockdown. Like other global cities, we observed substantial reductions in PM2.5 concentrations, from 19 to 43% (Chennai), 41-53% (Delhi), 26-54% (Hyderabad), 24-36% (Kolkata), and 10-39% (Mumbai). Generally, cities with larger traffic volumes showed greater reductions. Aerosol loading decreased by 29% (Chennai), 11% (Delhi), 4% (Kolkata), and 1% (Mumbai) against 2019 data. Health and related economic impact assessments indicated 630 prevented premature deaths during lockdown across all five cities, valued at 0.69 billion USD. Improvements in air quality may be considered a temporary lockdown benefit as revitalising the economy could reverse this trend. Regulatory bodies must closely monitor air quality levels, which currently offer a baseline for future mitigation plans."

However, there has been no detailed investigation of the diversity and biogenesis contribution of sulfate-reducing bacteria in arsenic-contaminated soils from realgar deposits. To elucidate this issue, soil samples from representative abandoned realgar deposits were collected. Microcosm assays illustrated that all three samples (2-1, 2-2, and 2-3) displayed efficient sulfate and As(V)-respiring activities. Furthermore, a total of 28 novel sequence variants of dissimilatory sulfite reductase genes and 2 new families of dsrAB genes were successfully identified. A novel dissimilatory sulfate-reducing bacterium, Desulfotomaculum sp. JL1, was also isolated from soils, and can efficiently respiratory reduce As(V) and sulfate in 4 and 5 days, respectively. JL1 can promote the generation of yellow precipitates in the presence of multiple electron acceptors (both contain sulfate and As(V) in the cultures), which indicated the biogenesis contribution of sulfate-reducing bacteria to the realgar mine. Moreover, this area had unique microbial communities; the most abundant populations belonged to the phyla Proteobacteria, Chloroflexi, and Acidobacteriota, which were attributed to the unique geochemistry characteristics, such as total organic carbon, total As, NO3-, and SO42-. The results of this study provide new insight into the diversity and biogenesis contributions of sulfate-reducing bacteria in arsenic-contaminated soils from realgar deposits."

Herein, we demonstrate a novel aqueous Zn-C2 H2 battery, which not only switches energy-consuming acetylene removal to electricity generation, but also reduces acetylene to ethylene through a unique discharge mechanism: C2 H2 +Zn+H2 O→C2 H4 +ZnO. Under a pure acetylene stream, this Zn-C2 H2 battery exhibits an open circuit potential of 1.14 V and a peak power density of 2.2 mW cm-2 , which exceed those of reported Zn-CO2 batteries. Even for simulated crude ethylene, the Zn-C2 H2 battery manifests an acetylene conversion of 99.97 % and continuously produces polymer-grade ethylene with only ≈3 ppm acetylene during a long-term discharge operation. Such a functional battery is universally appliable for reducing other alkynes and generating electricity. Therefore, this work provides an effective strategy for green ethylene purification and the design of functional batteries."
404,"A system dynamics model to quantify the impacts of restoration measures on the water-energy-food nexus in the Urmia lake Basin, Iran","Bakhshianlamouki, Elham; Masia, Sara; Karimi, Poolad; van der Zaag, Pieter; Susnik, Janez","Water scarcity exacerbated by growing demand in different sectors has created environmental, social, and economic challenges in the Urmia Lake Basin, Iran. Tackling this problem requires an integrated approach considering the basin as an interconnected system where a change in one sector affects others. Here, a System Dynamics Model is developed to simulate the water-energy-food nexus in the Urmia Lake Basin as a holistic multi-sectoral system and to assess the impacts of proposed lake restoration measures, especially looking for trade-offs. Besides considering climate change impacts, the effect of different sets of measures including increasing irrigation efficiency, increasing return flows, inter-basin water transfers, crop land retirement, and reviving a portion of the lake on the natural resources and socio-economic state of the basin are analysed. Results show that Urmia Lake level is sensitive to climate change scenarios. A holistic restoration approach could be effective in increasing the lake level to the proposed ecological level by 2040. However, in doing so, electricity demand in the agricultural sector could grow significantly. It is shown that a 20% retirement of irrigated wheat lands to curb water demand, if coupled with a 20% increase in yield on 80% and 50% of irrigated and rain-fed fields respectively, will not reduce wheat production in the basin. The effectiveness of water demand management measures is highly dependent on continuous monitoring and enforcement, particularly in restricting growth in agricultural water consumption. This study considered all nexus sectors in a holistic way to assess the total impact of proposed measures which on paper look positive, but may have unexpected consequences such as increasing energy demand for electric pumps. In dialogue with Urmia Lake restoration practitioners, this work can feed in to inform effective decisions for the restoration of Urmia Lake. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

A prolonged QTc was more frequent (10.1 vs. 5.1%, p = 0.040) in patients with high-risk cancer than in low to intermediate risk patients. The absolute QTc-time was correlated with age (r = 0.125), neutrophil count (r = 0.130) and negatively correlated with the testosterone level (r=-0.205). Treating physicians should be aware of this and monitor the QTc during ADT to possibly decrease cardiac morbidity/mortality in these patients who are more likely to require ADT."
406,Are millennials more multimodal? A latent-class cluster analysis with attitudes and preferences among millennial and Generation X commuters in California,"Lee, Yongsung; Circella, Giovanni; Mokhtarian, Patricia L.; Guhathakurta, Subhrajit","Millennials tend to use a variety of travel modes more often than older birth cohorts. Two potential explanations for this phenomenon prevail in the literature. According to the first explanation, millennials often choose travel multimodality at least in part because of the effects of the economic crisis, which affected young adults more severely than their older counterparts. Another explanation points to the fact that millennials may have fundamentally different preferences from those of older birth cohorts. This paper presents an examination of millennials' travel behavior as compared to the preceding Generation X, based on a survey of 1069 California commuters. It shows that millennials adopt multimodality more often than Gen Xers, on average. However, the analysis also points to substantial heterogeneity among millennials and indicates that, perhaps contrary to expectations and the stereotype in the media, the majority of millennials are monomodal drivers in California. The paper contributes to the literature on millennials' mobility in several ways. First, it rigorously classifies various forms of travel multimodality (on a monthly basis and distinctively taking trip purpose into account) through the analysis of a rich dataset that includes individual attitudes and preferences; second, it explores gradual changes of multimodality across age and generation; and third, it analyzes the effects of various demographic, built environment, and attitudinal attributes on the adoption of multimodality."

The procedure involved the mixing of the sample with acetonitrile in appropriate volumes followed by the addition of sodium sulfate solution in order to facilitate phase separation. The parameters influencing the extraction performance were studied and optimized using a two-step experimental design. The analytical procedure was thoroughly validated using the accuracy profiles as a graphical decision-making tool. The β-expectation tolerance intervals did not exceed the acceptance criteria of ±15% meaning that 95% of future results will be included in the defined bias limits. The limits of detection of the procedure were satisfactory, ranging between 0.01 and 0.03 μg/mL. The mean analytical bias in the spiking levels was satisfactory and ranged between -10.3 and 4.2% while the relative standard deviation was lower than 5.6%. Monte-Carlo simulations followed by capability analysis were employed to investigate the ruggedness of the sample preparation protocol. The developed method offers advantages compared to previously reported approaches for the same type of analysis including extraction efficiency and scaling down of the sample volume and extraction time."
408,Copper Oxide Nanoparticles Exhibit Cell Death Through Oxidative Stress Responses in Human Airway Epithelial Cells: a Mechanistic Study,"Nida N Farshori,Maqsood A Siddiqui,Mai M Al-Oqail,Ebtesam S Al-Sheddi,Shaza M Al-Massarani,Maqusood Ahamed,Javed Ahmad,Abdulaziz A Al-Khedhairy,Nida N Farshori,Maqsood A Siddiqui,Mai M Al-Oqail,Ebtesam S Al-Sheddi,Shaza M Al-Massarani,Maqusood Ahamed,Javed Ahmad,Abdulaziz A Al-Khedhairy","Copper oxide nanoparticles (CuONPs) are purposefully used to inhibit the growth of bacteria, algae, and fungi. Several studies on the beneficial and harmful effects of CuONPs have been conducted in vivo and in vitro, but there are a few studies that explain the toxicity of CuONPs in human airway epithelial cells (HEp-2). As a result, the purpose of this study is to look into the dose-dependent toxicity of CuONPs in HEp-2 cells. After 24 h of exposure to 1-40 µg/ml CuONPs, the MTT and neutral red assays were used to test for cytotoxicity. To determine the mechanism(s) of cytotoxicity in HEp-2 cells, additional oxidative stress assays (LPO and GSH), the amount of ROS produced, the loss of MMP, caspase enzyme activities, and apoptosis-related genes were performed using qRT-PCR. CuONPs exhibited dose-dependent cytotoxicity in HEp-2 cells, with an IC50 value of ~ 10 μg/ml. The morphology of HEp-2 cells was also altered in a dose-dependent manner. The involvement of oxidative stress in CuONP-induced cytotoxicity was demonstrated by increased LPO levels and ROS generation, as well as decreased levels of GSH and MMP. Furthermore, activated caspase enzymes and altered apoptotic genes support CuONPs' ability to induce apoptosis in HEp-2 cells. Overall, this study demonstrated that CuONPs can cause apoptosis in HEp-2 cells via oxidative stress; therefore, CuONPs may pose a risk to human health and should be handled and used with caution."
409,Digitalization of Agri-Cooperatives in the Smart Agriculture Context. Proposal of a Digital Diagnosis Tool,"Manuel Ciruela-Lorenzo, Antonio; Rosa Del Aguila-Obra, Ana; Padilla-Melendez, Antonio; Jose Plaza-Angulo, Juan","The use of digital technologies has been recognized as one of the great challenges for businesses of the 21st century. This digitalization is characterized by the intensive use of information technologies in the different stages of the value chain of a sector. In this context, smart agriculture is transforming the agricultural sector in terms of economic, social, and environmental sustainability. In some countries, cooperatives, as the most common legal form of the incumbent companies, in this rather traditional low-intensive technology sector, are going to develop a relevant role in the process of adoption of these technologies. In this context, this paper provides, first, a review of the evolution of the main digital technologies, such as Internet of Things, robots, Artificial Intelligence, Big Data, and Blockchain, among others. Second, a description of the digital innovation process in agri-cooperatives in order to help them in the decision-making process, and third, a digital diagnosis tool for measuring cooperatives' digital innovation. This tool is initially applied to two cases of agri-cooperatives in Spain. All of this contributes to a better understanding of digitalization of agri-cooperatives in the context of smart agriculture."
410,Design and performance evaluation of a new waste incineration power system integrated with a supercritical CO2 power cycle and a coal-fired power plant,"Chen, Heng; Zhang, Meiyan; Wu, Yunyun; Xu, Gang; Liu, Wenyi; Liu, Tong","A novel waste incineration power system highly integrated with a supercritical CO2 power cycle and a coal-fired power plant has been developed. In the hybrid configuration, the supercritical CO2 cycle gains energy from the superheater of the waste-to-energy (WTE) boiler, and the saturated steam produced by the WTE boiler is employed to heat the feedwater of the coal power plant. Consequently, the cascade energy utilization of the waste can be realized with the improvement of the WTE process. The performance of the proposed integrated scheme was thermodynamically and economically evaluated as compared to the conventional separate scheme, based on a 500 t/d incineration unit and a 300 MW coal power plant. The results indicate that the waste-to-electricity efficiency is promoted by 8.34 percentage points with an additional net power output of 3.33 MW, when adopting the proposal. The total exergy efficiency and the exergy efficiency of waste-to-electricity are increased by 0.43 and 7.88 percentage points. Additionally, the proposed system performs excellently under various boiler loads. Due to the integration, the net present value of the WTE project rises by 18.17 M$ and the dynamic payback period is reduced by 4.20 years. Therefore, the new design is extremely feasible and profitable."
411,Factors affecting the travel mode choice of the urban elderly in healthcare activity: comparison between core area and suburban area,"Du, Mingyang; Cheng, Lin; Li, Xuefeng; Yang, Jingzong","This study investigated the travel characteristics and influential factors of travel mode choice for healthcare activity by the elderly in core area and suburb. The results of descriptive analysis and multinomial logistic models show that: (1) Bus and walking are main modes for the elderly to seek medical treatment. The elderly in suburb travel longer distance and are more dependent on bus than those in core area. (2) The service efficiency improvements of hospitals could promote the elderly in core area to choose green modes, while those in suburb are more likely to utilize cars to obtain high-quality medical resources. (3) For long-distance travel, the influence of family economic backgrounds on the mode choice is more significant in suburb, and the difference of family economic will further aggravate the internal differentiation in long-distance travel among the elderly in suburb. (4) Interestingly, the elderly in core area tend to utilize cars to seek for healthcare when they live with their offspring, while those in suburb tend to use cars and taxis when they have serious illness and require companion. Finally, relevant policies and suggestions were proposed to improve the accessibility and fairness of healthcare travel for the elderly."
412,Prehospital Trauma Airway Management: An NAEMSP Position Statement and Resource Document,"Sabina Braithwaite,Christopher Stephens,Kyle Remick,Whitney Barrett,Francis X Guyette,Michael Levy,Christopher Colwell,Sabina Braithwaite,Christopher Stephens,Kyle Remick,Whitney Barrett,Francis X Guyette,Michael Levy,Christopher Colwell","Definitive management of trauma is not possible in the out-of-hospital environment. Rapid treatment and transport of trauma casualties to a trauma center are vital to improve survival and outcomes. Prioritization and management of airway, oxygenation, ventilation, protection from gross aspiration, and physiologic optimization must be balanced against timely patient delivery to definitive care. The optimal prehospital airway management strategy for trauma has not been clearly defined; the best choice should be patient-specific. NAEMSP recommends:The approach to airway management and the choice of airway interventions in a trauma patient requires an iterative, individualized assessment that considers patient, clinician, and environmental factors.Optimal trauma airway management should focus on meeting the goals of adequate oxygenation and ventilation rather than on specific interventions. Emergency medical services (EMS) clinicians should perform frequent reassessments to determine if there is a need to escalate from basic to advanced airway interventions.Management of immediately life-threatening injuries should take priority over advanced airway insertion.Drug-assisted airway management should be considered within a comprehensive algorithm incorporating failed airway options and balanced management of pain, agitation, and delirium.EMS medical directors must be highly engaged in assuring clinician competence in trauma airway assessment, management, and interventions."
413,Digital Transformation and Knowledge Management in the Public Sector,"Alvarenga, Ana; Matos, Florinda; Godina, Radu; Matias, Joao C. O.","Digitizing public services is, at the moment, an essential necessity for numerous governments around the world. An improved government through digitization will not only have a growing effect on businesses, but it will also be able to intensify citizen engagement and push for economic growth. During the last 10 years more countries have progressively begun to provide digital services to their citizens. Therefore, in order to address this development, the purpose of this paper is to analyze the evolution of the digital government literature in order to describe the aspects of digital transformation in the public sector and how it is related to knowledge management. In this study the methodology is quantitative and it is based on a review and a survey made with the main goal being the estimation from several collected data on how the digital transformation process in the Public Administration takes place and what its relationship is with knowledge management. The review study is based on articles found on Scopus database and it addresses the role that digital government research plays in the theory and practice of knowledge management. In the survey study, 54 employees working for the services of the two governmental areas of the Portuguese Ministry of the Environment were surveyed. The results show that the research on the theme is still at an exploratory stage due to the lack of studies relating digital government to knowledge management effectiveness in the public sector. The results also show that the success of digital government seems to be related with the quality of the organizations' knowledge management, complementing each other for significant improvements in the public sector. In terms of originality, this study aims to contribute and stimulate data-driven discussions regarding the impacts of the digital transformation in the public sector and their relation with the implementation of knowledge management practices. The results offer insights into future research needs."
414,"The nexus between renewable energy, economic growth, trade, urbanisation and environmental quality: A comparative study for Australia and Canada","Rahman, Mohammad Mafizur; Vu (Benjamin), Xuan-Binh","Using a comparative approach, this study examines the nexus among renewable energy consumption, economic growth, trade, urbanisation and CO2 emissions for Australia and Canada for the period 1960-2015. The Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) bounds tests are used to explore the long-run relationships amongst the selected variables and the causal relationships are examined by the vector error correction model (VECM) Granger causality tests. The findings suggest that there is evidence of the long run relationships amongst the variables. The results in Australia indicate that in both the long run and short run, economic growth increases CO2 emissions, whereas in the short run, the trade and renewable energy consumptions decrease CO2 emissions. The VECM causality tests for Australia indicate that in the short-run, the economic growth, trade, and renewable energy consumption Granger cause CO2 emissions; whereas the long-run causal relationships are found among CO2 emissions, economic growth, trade and renewable energy consumption. In the case of Canada, the results show that in both the long run and short run, trade increases CO2 emissions, while in the long run the economic growth and urban population increase CO2 emissions. The VECM causality analyses show the long-run bidirectional causality among CO2 emissions, economic growth, and renewable energy consumption. In addition, the CO2 emissions tended to decrease in Australia but not in Canada after each country officially ratified the Kyoto Protocol in 2007 and 2002, respectively. Policy recommendations are made based on these findings. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."
415,When breaks get hot: inflammatory signaling in BRCA1/2-mutant cancers,"Marcel A T M van Vugt,Eileen E Parkes,Marcel A T M van Vugt,Eileen E Parkes","Genomic instability and inflammation are intricately connected hallmark features of cancer. DNA repair defects due to BRCA1/2 mutation instigate immune signaling through the cGAS/STING pathway. The subsequent inflammatory signaling provides both tumor-suppressive as well as tumor-promoting traits. To prevent clearance by the immune system, genomically instable cancer cells need to adapt to escape immune surveillance. Currently, it is unclear how genomically unstable cancers, including BRCA1/2-mutant tumors, are rewired to escape immune clearance. Here, we summarize the mechanisms by which genomic instability triggers inflammatory signaling and describe adaptive mechanisms by which cancer cells can 'fly under the radar' of the immune system. Additionally, we discuss how therapeutic activation of the immune system may improve treatment of genomically instable cancers."
416,Convergence analysis of city-level energy intensity in China,"Zhu, Junpeng; Lin, Boqiang","Understanding the convergence patterns of energy intensity and the drivers leading to the club convergence are of great significance for local governments to implement targeted policies to improve energy efficiency. With this in mind, we begin with the collection of energy consumption data of 193 Chinese cities at prefecture level or above, then we adopt the log t-test and clustering algorithm to investigate convergence characteristics of energy intensity. Besides, the Ordered Probit model is adopted to investigate the drivers that affect the formulation of convergent club. We identify four convergent clubs among total 193 cities, and these clubs show great differences in energy intensity. Marketization degree, population density, foreign direct investment, resource endowment, and industrial structure are recognized as the drivers of the formation of convergence clubs. This paper adds more evidence to understand the energy intensity gap, we propose that upgrading the industrial structure, exerting economic assemble advantage, enhancing the level of opening up, and improving the marketization level are favorable measures to reduce energy intensity."

The aim of the Reconstructive Surgery Trials Network #RSTNCOVID Hand Surgery survey was to document the changes made in the UK and Europe and consider which might persist. A survey developed by the Reconstructive Surgery Trials Network, in association with the British Association of Hand Therapists, was distributed to hand surgery units across the UK and Europe after the first wave of COVID-19. It was completed by one consultant hand surgeon at each of the 44 units that responded. Adult and paediatric trauma were maintained but elective services stopped. Consultations were increasingly virtual, and surgery was more likely to be under local anaesthetic and in a lower resource setting. Many of the changes are viewed as being beneficial. However, it is important to establish that they are clinically and cost effective. These survey results will help prioritise and support future research initiatives."

Although the aetiology remains unclear, evidence is mounting that exposure to persistent hydrocarbon pollutants is a substantial risk factor, predisposing a person to neurological diseases later in life. Epidemiological studies correlate environmental hydrocarbon exposure to brain disorders including neuropathies, cognitive, motor and sensory impairments; neurodevelopmental disorders like autism spectrum disorder (ASD); and neurodegenerative disorders like Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD). Particulate matter, benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, xylenes, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and endocrine-disrupting chemicals have all been linked to neurodevelopmental problems in all class of people. There is mounting evidence that supports the prevalence of petroleum hydrocarbon becoming neurotoxic and being involved in the pathogenesis of AD and PD. More study is needed to fully comprehend the scope of these problems in the context of unconventional oil and natural gas. This review summarises in vitro, animal and epidemiological research on the genesis of neurodegenerative disorders, highlighting evidence that supports inexorable role of hazardous hydrocarbon exposure in the pathophysiology of AD and PD. In this review, we offer a summary of the existing evidence gathered through a Medline literature search of systematic reviews and meta-analyses of the most important epidemiological studies published so far."
419,Effect of Unsymmetrical Dimethylhydrazine on Isolated Heart and Lymphatic Vessels,"O V Nechaykina,D S Laptev,S G Petunov,D V Bobkov,O V Nechaykina,D S Laptev,S G Petunov,D V Bobkov","Unsymmetrical dimethylhydrazine (UDMH, heptyl) and its derivatives are used in the rocket and space industry as components of rocket fuel. UDMH is a highly toxic compound exhibiting irritant, hepatotoxic, and neurotoxic properties. In this study, the toxic effect of heptyl on isolated rat heart and lymphatic vessels was demonstrated. Acute exposure to UDMH leads to vasoconstriction of the coronary vessels of the isolated heart and pronounced stimulation of isolated lymphangions starting from the concentration of 10-4 M. The changes are dose-dependent. After exposure to UDMH in high concentrations (10-2 M), the changes in the functional parameters became irreversible. The obtained results provide evidence for the organ-specific effect of UDMH on visceral muscle organs."
420,"Linking Information Communication Technology, trade globalization index, and CO(2)emissions: evidence from advanced panel techniques","Ahmed, Zahoor; Le, Hoang Phong","Previous studies consider ICT a two-edged sword that can harm or benefit the environment. In recent years, ICT penetration has considerably increased in the ASEAN-6 countries and the leaders of ASEAN are willing to bring a digital revolution by increasing ICT infrastructure and reducing trade barriers in the region under the Master Plan of ASEAN Connectivity-2025. Hence, this paper explores the effect of ICT and the recently developed trade globalization index on CO(2)emissions in ASEAN-6 countries. The study relies on advanced panel econometric approaches, including Westerlund (2007,2008) and Pedroni cointegration tests, CUP-FM long-run method, and panel DH causality approach. The results suggest cointegration among variables. The results of CUP-FM indicate that ICT contributes to improving environmental quality by mitigating CO(2)emissions. Similarly, trade globalization is also sustainable in the region as it reduces emissions. The results are also confirmed by using the CUP-BC estimator. The findings from the DH causality test unfold causality from ICT and trade globalization index to CO(2)emissions. Besides, the long-run estimates reveal the detrimental effect of energy consumption on emissions and the U-shaped association between GDP and emissions. Moreover, unidirectional causality from ICT to trade globalization index and energy consumption indicates that ICT influences trade globalization and energy consumption. Finally, environmental policies in the context of ASEAN are extensively discussed."
421,Epigenetic Modifications and Neurodegenerative Disorders: A Biochemical Perspective,"Xiaoxiao Zhang,Jiaming Zhang,Yuchuan Wang,Minji Wang,Man Tang,Yuhan Lin,Qiuyun Liu,Xiaoxiao Zhang,Jiaming Zhang,Yuchuan Wang,Minji Wang,Man Tang,Yuhan Lin,Qiuyun Liu","Methylations in living cells are methyl groups attached to amino acids, DNA, RNA, and so on. However, their biochemical roles have not been fully defined. A theory has been postulated that methylation leads to hyperconjugation, and the electron-donating feature weakens a nearby chemical bond, which increases the bond length of C4-N4 of 5-methylcytosine, therefore weakening the C4-N4 bond and resulting in stronger protonation or hydrogen bonding of the N4 nitrogen atom. Protonation can give rise to the generation of mutagenic and carcinogenic strong acids such as HCl, which are also capable of solubilizing stressful, insoluble, and stiff salts. Insoluble and rigid salts such as calcium oxalate and/or calcium phosphate were recently proposed as a primary cause of some neurodegenerative disorders. Protonation of nitrogen atoms in 5-methylcytosine enhances the interaction with negatively charged phosphate groups and contributes to the formation of compact heterochromatin. The electronegativity of the oxygen atoms in the modifications of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine or 5-formylcytosine can shorten the lengths of adjacent bonds with no increase of cation affinity in N4. The carboxyl group in 5-carboxylcytosine is a weak acid capable of antagonizing mutagenic HCl and modestly helping solubilize insoluble salts. Electron delocalization of the methyl group in N4-methylcytosine results in a lower affinity of N4 to cations. The positive charge at N3 in the resonance structure of 3-methylcytosine is lessened by the electron-donating attribute of the methyl group attached to the N3 atom, consequently reducing acid formation. The electron delocalization of three methyl groups decreases the positive charge in the amino nitrogen in the side group of lysine 4 in histone H3, weakening interactions with phosphate groups and consequently activating gene expression. The carbonyl oxygen in 8-oxo-7,8-dihydroguanine draws protons and accumulates HCl, accounting for its moderate mutation propensity and potential capacity to solubilize stiff salts. The biochemical insight will further our understanding on the crosstalk of genetics and epigenetics in the etiology of neurodegenerative diseases."
422,"Pyroptosis regulators exert crucial functions in prognosis, progression and immune microenvironment of pancreatic adenocarcinoma: a bioinformatic and in vitro research","Zhenghai Bai,Fangshi Xu,Xiaodan Feng,Yuan Wu,Junhua Lv,Yu Shi,Honghong Pei,Zhenghai Bai,Fangshi Xu,Xiaodan Feng,Yuan Wu,Junhua Lv,Yu Shi,Honghong Pei","Pyroptosis is an inflammatory programmed cell death, showing potentials to be a novel anti-cancer approach. However, the roles of pyroptosis-related (PR) genes (PRGs) in pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PAAD) remain elusive. In the present study, we constructed a novel PR risk signature through the lasso regression analysis. The risk signature was greatly conducive to PAAD prognostic assessment. PR risk score was identified as an independent prognostic factor and could distinguish the prognostic differences of most clinical subgroups. Meanwhile, it could improve the traditional prognostic models based on TNM-staging. Next, its prognostic value was also tested in five validation cohorts. Using CIBERSORT, ESTIMATE, and ssGSEA algorithms, the effects of PR risk signature on tumor immune microenvironment (TIM) were explored. High PR risk suppressed antitumor immune through decreasing the infiltrating levels of CD8 T and NK cells. The genomic information and histological expression of risk PRGs were uncovered by USCA and HPA databases. Somatic mutation, methylation alteration, and homozygous CNV of eight PRGs barely occurred in PAAD samples. As for therapeutic correlation, PR risk score may not predict the efficacy of PD-1/L1 inhibitors and was weakly associated with multiple drug susceptibilities. Finally, the biofunctions of toll like receptor 3 (TLR3) in pancreatic cancer (PC) cells were investigated through qPCR, MTT, colony formation, and Transwell assays. Overexpression of TLR3 could promote the proliferation, migration, and invasion of PC cells. In conclusion, PRGs play crucial roles in prognosis, progression, and immune microenvironment of PAAD. TLR3 is expected to be a promising therapeutic target."
423,Emergy-based ecosystem services valuation and classification management applied to China's grasslands,"Yang, Qing; Liu, Gengyuan; Giannetti, Biagio F.; Agostinho, Feni; Almeida, Cecilia M. V. B.; Casazza, Marco","Though grasslands cover one fifth area of global land and provide vital services for humans, half of them are degraded due to human interference and climate change. In this paper we perform evaluations of the delivery of ecosystem services (ES) of grasslands using a systems approach and the technique of emergy accounting. Firstly, we address the issue of anthropocentricity of ES through discussion and analysis using the concept of emergy as contrasted to economic value, i.e. willingness-to-pay. Secondly, we explore from a systems classification of provisioning, regulating, cultural and supporting services. Thirdly, we provide quantitative analysis of the value added (surplus value) to economies by ecosystems. An emergy-based index of classification management of grassland (ICG), is also implemented, together with a non-monetary benefit-cost analysis of grassland ES. It is established that emergy provides an approach to evaluating the contributions ecosystems make to the economy using the idea of net benefit ratio, computed as the emergy cost of providing a service through technology (aka replacement cost) divided by emergy required to sustain ecosystem functions. This study can provide a systematic biophysical accounting method for grassland ESV to implement future sustainable management practices."

Initial and continuing education for airway management must therefore extend beyond a narrow focus on psychomotor skills and task completion to include appreciation of underlying pathophysiology, clinical judgment, and higher-order decision making. NAEMSP recommends:Active engagement in deliberate practice should be the guiding approach for developing and maintaining competence in airway management.EMS learners and clinicians must be educated in an escalating approach to airway management, where basic airway maneuvers form the central focus.Educational activities should extend beyond fundamental knowledge to focus on the development of clinical judgment.Optimization of patient outcomes should be valued over performance of individual airway management skills.Credentialing and continuing education activities in airway management are essential to advance clinicians beyond entry-level competency.Initial and continuing education programs should be responsive to advances in the evidence base and maintain adaptability to re-assess content and expected outcomes on a continual basis."
425,Impact of financial development and energy consumption on environmental degradation in 184 countries using a dynamic panel model,"Khan, Sher; Khan, Muhammad Kamran; Muhammad, Bashir","This study aimed to examine the impact of financial development and energy consumption on CO2 emissions by employing balanced panel data from the period 1990-2017 for 184 countries worldwide. This study applied seemingly unrelated regression (SUR), two-step difference, and the system GMM model for data analysis. The examined results of SUR, two-step difference, and system GMM show that energy consumption positively impacts the CO2 emissions worldwide; on the other hand, the examined results of two-step difference and the system GMM model indicate that financial development helps to reduce the CO2 emissions and the results of SUR indicate that financial development positively impacts the CO2 emissions. The examined results regarding economic growth indicate a positive effect on the CO2 emission and the square of economic growth verifies the validly of the environmental Kuznets curve in 184 countries. This study has significant implications for policy makers with regard to environment improvement, clean energy conservation, and an efficient financial system. Further directions are suggested based on the examined results."
426,"Residential energy environmental Kuznets curve in emerging economies: the role of economic growth, renewable energy consumption, and financial development","Raza, Syed Ali; Shah, Nida; Khan, Komal Akram","The aim of the present paper is to determine residential energy environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) in Next-11 and BRICS countries with the specific consideration on the role of economic growth, renewable energy consumption, and financial development from an era of 1990-2015. In order to determine the cross-section independence and to control the heterogeneity between cross-sections in the paper, we have applied unique and advanced techniques of econometrics panel data. Moreover, the following tests have been applied which are the CIPS unit root test, co-integration test, fully modified ordinary least square (FMOLS), and heterogeneous panel causality technique. The outcomes revealed that in the long run, all the variables are co-integrated. Moreover, there is a significant and positive influence of residential energy consumption, economic growth, and financial development on environmental degradation. However, in the reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, essential role is performed by renewable energy. On the other hand, findings show great support for the residential energy EKC hypothesis in emerging countries."
427,"Study on sustainable urbanization literature based on Web of Science, scopus, and China national knowledge infrastructure: A scientometric analysis in CiteSpace","Zhang, Dan; Xu, Jiapeng; Zhang, Yizhu; Wang, Jing; He, Siyu; Zhou, Xiao","As the world enters a new round of large-scale urbanization, the coordination of a balance between social, economic, and environmental systems to promote sustainable urban development has become a global focus. Scholars have explored sustainable urbanization, collected relevant literature, and analyzed the influence of research in different countries, finding that China's influence is second only to that of the US. Accordingly, this study uses the literature in China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), the world's largest Chinese database. It selects 3640 studies on sustainable urbanization from Web of Science and Scopus (W&S), and CNKI. Using the bibliometric method in Citespace, it systematically analyzes the research status, development course, and potential trends of research on sustainable urbanization. The results show that: (1) The number of studies on sustainable urbanization in CNKI is decreasing by year, while it has increased gradually in W&S. China currently has the most literature in the field of sustainable urbanization. The US, China, and Germany have the most influential studies. (2) W&S and CNKI each have their separate and complementary emphases. (3) The two datasets are more similar in terms of the nature of their research institutions, but cooperation between the institutions is closer in W&S than in CNKI. There are no aggregation or scaling effects in the Chinese research institutions. The Chinese Academy of Sciences and Hong Kong Polytechnic University are leaders in this field. (4) The top five topics in the studies from W&S are urban development models and public administration, urban planning issues, protection of urban ecosystems, urban land-use changes, and pollution and resource consumption during urbanization. The top five topics in the CNKI studies are strategy of sustainable development, urban development, urbanization and population urbanization, land financing and urban economics, and urban development planning. The construction of urban ecosystems with reasonable structure, efficient processes, and complete functions is an important breakthrough in the application of sustainable urbanization. Reasonably controlling the pace of urban expansion, efficiently coordinating urban and rural development, formulating evidence-based urban development strategies, and ensuring the living standard of urban settlements are the key problems in sustainable urbanization, and will become important directions for related future research.

Given that prior research has documented competing stances on the effectiveness of specialty courts for CSE-impacted populations, we conducted a systematic review of the literature to identify key characteristics of programming, profiles of adolescents served, and effectiveness of these courts. To identify relevant research and information, we systematically searched scholarly databases and information sources, conducted reference harvesting, and forwarded citation chaining. Articles presenting primary data with quantitative, qualitative, or mixed methodologies or programmatic descriptions of specialty courts serving adolescents at risk or with confirmed histories of CSE that were published after 2004 were included. We identified 39 articles on 21 specialty courts serving adolescents at risk or with confirmed histories of CSE, including seven specialty courts with evaluation or outcome data. Across specialty courts, adolescents benefited from an increase in linkage to specialized services, improved residential placement stability, and reduction in recidivism-measured by new criminal charges. Specialty court participation was also associated with improved educational outcomes and decreased instances of running away. A lack of empirical data, specifically of evaluation studies, emerged as a weakness in the literature. Still, findings support that specialty courts can be an integral judicial system response to CSE. Multidisciplinary collaboration can help target and respond to the multifaceted needs of adolescents, encourage healthy behaviors, and promote their overall wellness."
429,Energy storage and management system design optimization for a photovoltaic integrated low-energy building,"Liu, Jia; Chen, Xi; Yang, Hongxing; Li, Yutong","This study aims to analyze and optimize the photovoltaic-battery energy storage (PV-BES) system installed in a low-energy building in China. A novel energy management strategy considering the battery cycling aging, grid relief and local time-of-use pricing is proposed based on TRNSYS. Both single-criterion and multi-criterion optimizations are conducted by comprehensively considering technical, economic and environmental performances of the system based on decision-making strategies including the weighted sum and minimum distance to the utopia point methods. The single-criterion optimizations achieve superior performances in the energy supply, battery storage, utility grid and whole system aspect respectively over the existing scenario of the target building. The multi-criterion optimization considering all performance indicators shows that the PV self-consumption and PV efficiency can be increased by 15.0% and 48.6% while the standard deviation of net grid power, battery cycling aging and CO2 emission can be reduced by 3.4%, 78.5% and 34.7% respectively. The significance and impact of design parameters are further quantified by both local and global sensitivity analyses. This study can provide references for the optimum energy management of PV-BES systems in low-energy buildings and guide the renewable energy and energy storage system design to achieve higher penetration of renewable applications into urban areas.

Several common clinical risk factors coexist in cancer patients are used as risk predictive biomarkers to help in the management and prevention of VTE. These include cancer site and stage, chemotherapy regimen and elevated biological markers. However, Genetic polymorphisms in genes controlling coagulation and fibrinolysis are significantly associated with VTE if detected, then they might be more sensitive individual predictive biomarkers for VTE risk assessment. This study was conducted to evaluate the association between ITGB3 rs3809865 and rs5918 with VTE risk as well as monitor the effect of VTE on overall survival of these cancer patients. In this retrospective case-control study, 195 cancer patients' formalin-fixed paraffin embedded tissue (FFPE) samples were collected (controls n = 157, case n = 38) using the stored data through Jan 2010 to Sep 2018 from King Fahad Specialist Hospital in Dammam. Samples were genotyped using TaqMan genotyping assay, then logistic regression analysis and Chi-square were used to predict the association between risk factors and VTE. Survival Comparison was tested by the log-rank test. Genetic polymorphisms in ITGB3 (rs3809865 and rs5918) found not to be associated with VTE increasing risk in cancer patients (p>0.05). While the advanced stage was potentially increasing the risk of VTE events (OR 5.1 CI 2.01-12.9p = 0.001). Patients with VTE showed a poor overall survival reflected by the median survival rate of only three years compared to seven years for cancer patients without VTE. This study highlighted the potential influence of VTE on prognosis and survival of cancer patients and raised the importance of exploring risk predictive biomarkers in our population. This will improve the risk prediction biomarkers leading to implementing safe and effective thrombosis prophylaxis strategies."
431,Analyzing Similarities between the European Union Countries in Terms of the Structure and Volume of Energy Production from Renewable Energy Sources,"Brodny, Jaroslaw; Tutak, Magdalena","The European Union (EU) countries, as one of the most economically developed regions in the world, are taking increasingly decisive actions to reduce the emission of harmful substances into the natural environment. This can be exemplified by a new climate strategy referred to as ""The European Green Deal"". Its basic assumption is that the EU countries will have achieved climate neutrality by 2050. To do so, it is necessary to make an energy transition involving the widest possible use of renewable energy sources (RES) for energy production. However, activities in this area should be preceded by analyses due to the large diversity of the EU countries in terms of economic development, the number of inhabitants and their wealth as well as geographical location and area. The results of such analyses should support the implementation of adopted strategies. In order to assess the current state of the energy sector in the EU and indicate future directions of activities, research was carried out to analyze the structure and volume of energy production from RES in the EU countries. The aim of the study was to divide the EU countries into similar groups by the structure and volume of energy production from RES. This production was compared with the number of inhabitants of each EU country, its area and the value of Gross Domestic Product (GDP). This approach allows a new and broader view of the structure of energy production from RES and creates an opportunity to take into account additional factors when developing and implementing new climate strategies. The k-means algorithm was used for the analysis. The presented analyses and obtained results constitute a new approach to studying the diversified energy market in the EU. The results should be used for the development of a common energy and climate policy and economic integration of the EU countries."
432,COVID-19 Vaccine Could Trigger the Relapse of Secondary Hypersomnia,"Min Wu,Shirley Xin Li,Pei Xue,Junying Zhou,Xiangdong Tang,Min Wu,Shirley Xin Li,Pei Xue,Junying Zhou,Xiangdong Tang","The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has brought significant social and economic disruptions and devastating impacts on public health, and vaccines are being developed to combat the disease. Timely vaccination may prevent complications and morbidity but may also potentially result in unforeseen outcomes in some special clinical populations. We report on a case of hypersomnia relapse after the COVID-19 vaccination, with the aim of informing the development of the guideline on vaccination in specific groups. A 19-year old female presented with persistent daytime sleepiness after receiving the COVID-19 vaccine. She had a known history of hypersomnia secondary to infectious mononucleosis but has fully recovered for 8 months. A series of examinations were performed on this patient. Neurologic and psychiatric examinations were unremarkable. Despite normal nocturnal subjective sleep quality (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index score = 5, Insomnia Severity Index score = 7), her Epworth sleepiness scale score (15) suggested an abnormal level of subjective sleepiness. Consistent with the subjective report, the objective assessment by Multiple Sleep Latency Test found mean sleep latency was 1.3 min with no sleep onset rapid-eye-movement (REM) period. We speculate that COVID-19 vaccine may potentially trigger the relapse of hypersomnia. The immune memory could be an explanation for the increased response to vaccine in patients with secondary hypersomnia. Caution should be warranted when administering COVID-19 vaccine in patients with hypersomnia secondary to infections."
433,"Spectacles of Settler Colonial Memory: Archaeological Findings from an Early Twentieth-Century ""First"" Settlement Pageant and Other Commemorative Terrain in New England","Meghan C L Howey,Christine M DeLucia,Meghan C L Howey,Christine M DeLucia","In 1923, rural New England mill town Dover, New Hampshire, staged a Tercentenary pageant of extraordinary proportions to celebrate its ""first"" settlement. This public spectacle memorialized a specific, and deeply exclusionary, narrative of English settler colonialism, shaped by social anxieties of the post-First World War United States. Recent archaeological research has found possible remnants from this spectacle on a seventeenth-century site. In disturbing this site, the Tercentenary pageant appears to have disregarded actual significant material traces from the very era it aimed to memorialize--traces that offer distinct, fuller understandings of deeply nuanced Native-settler interactions in the Piscataqua River region. Dover's pageant is situated in a regional analysis of Native and Euro-colonial commemorative place-making of the early twentieth century, exploring how different communities pursued multivocal, monovocal, or other approaches in their performative engagements with the seventeenth century."
434,"Analyzing the association between innovation, economic growth, and environment: divulging the importance of FDI and trade openness in India","Zameer, Hashim; Yasmeen, Humaira; Zafar, Muhammad Wasif; Waheed, Abdul; Sinha, Avik","The objective of this paper is to explore the nexus of innovation-environment and economic growth in the context of the Indian economy. To achieve the study objective, we explored the role of technological innovation, FDI, trade openness, energy use, and economic growth toward carbon emissions. Using the data of 1985-2017, the study employed ARDL bound testing and vector error correction model (VECM) methods to capture the effects of technological innovation, trade openness, FDI, energy use, and economic growth on CO2 emissions. Empirical estimation has confirmed the existence of long-run cointegration. Similarly, in the long run, it is found that trade openness, energy use, and economic growth positively reinforce CO2 emissions. In contrast, technological innovation and FDI negatively reinforce CO2 emissions in the long run. Furthermore, VECM indicates that the relationship among innovation, trade openness, and energy use is bidirectional in the long run. Whereas, unidirectional relation has been found that is coming from GDP to carbon emissions, FDI, innovation, trade, and energy use. In the short run, unidirectional link found which is coming from FDI, innovation, and energy use to carbon emission. However, the association between emissions and trade openness is bidirectional. The conclusions put forward policy implications that innovation is a way to reduce environmental degradation."
435,Spatial econometric analysis of foreign direct investment and carbon productivity in China: Two-tier moderating roles of industrialization development,"Long, Ruyin; Gan, Xin; Chen, Hong; Wang, Jiaqi; Li, Qianwen","The increasing of carbon productivity is crucial to the success of China's green development goals. Among them, Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) is seen as a potential pillar of achieving these strategic goals. Based on 1998-2016 provincial-level panel data in China, this paper combines influencing mechanisms such as the scale effect, structural effect, technical effect and environmental effect, and constructed a spatial simultaneous equations model of carbon productivity. This study calculated the comprehensive impact of FDI on carbon productivity by using the generalized space three-stage least-squares estimator method (GS3SLS), and further explored the moderating effect of the regional industrialization level by adding interaction items, in order to discuss the turning point of the local government's investment policy. The results showed that (1) Local FDI has a positive impact on local carbon productivity, but FDI in surrounding areas (SFDI) has a negative impact on local carbon productivity, structural effect is the main reason for the difference; (2) The moderating effect of industrial development does exist. By calculating the threshold of FDI and SFDI, this paper classifies China's industrialization development level into three levels. When formulating and implementing relevant policies to attract investment, the Chinese government should not simply implement the policy on the basis of geographical regions, but should fully coordinate heterogeneity between the introduction of FDI and industrialization development, so as to significantly improve China's carbon productivity."
436,"Introducing Power-to-H3: Combining renewable electricity with heat, water and hydrogen production and storage in a neighbourhood","van der Roest, Els; Snip, Laura; Fens, Theo; van Wijk, Ad","In the transition from fossil to renewable energy, the energy system should become clean, while remaining reliable and affordable. Because of the intermittent nature of both renewable energy production and energy demand, an integrated system approach is required that includes energy conversion and storage. We propose a concept for a neighbourhood where locally produced renewable energy is partly converted and stored in the form of heat and hydrogen, accompanied by rainwater collection, storage, purification and use (Power-to-H3). A model is developed to create an energy balance and perform a techno-economic analysis, including an analysis of the avoided costs within the concept. The results show that a solar park of 8.7 MWp combined with rainwater collection and solar panels on roofs, can supply 900 houses over the year with heat (20 TJ) via an underground heat storage system as well as with almost half of their water demand (36,000 m(3)) and 540 hydrogen electric vehicles can be supplied with hydrogen (90 tonnes). The production costs for both hydrogen (8.7 (sic)/kg) and heat (26 (sic)/GJ) are below the current end user selling price in the Netherlands (10 (sic)/kg and 34 (sic)/GJ), making the system affordable. When taking avoided costs into account, the prices could decrease with 20-26%, while at the same time avoiding 3600 tonnes of CO2 a year. These results make clear that it is possible to provide a neighbourhood with all these different utilities, completely based on solar power and rainwater in a reliable, affordable and clean way."
437,Talking About Childhood Obesity,"Ellen Wagner,Omar Jamil,Bethany Hodges,Ellen Wagner,Omar Jamil,Bethany Hodges","While discussing obesity with pediatric patients and their families can be difficult, it is an essential step toward appropriate weight management. There is paucity of data regarding language preferences when discussing obesity in this population. In this pilot qualitative study, we interviewed 8 parents of patients diagnosed with obesity to identify language and communication preferences for discussing their child's weight. Interviews were analyzed for emerging themes. Important trends appeared revealing that parents prefer neutral, medical terms discussed at well-child checks or obesity-specific visits. Providers should frame lifestyle changes as positive for all patients and set achievable goals with the help of visual aids. Our analysis uncovered several important communication strategies that can better equip providers to discuss obesity with their pediatric patients. This research may serve as a foundation for larger studies into the topic."

A review of clinical cases presented to the Aquatic Animal Health Unit at the University of the West Indies, School of Veterinary Medicine for the period September 2010 to December 2012 suggested that piscine mycobacteriosis may be widespread throughout the local ornamental fish industry. Thus, to determine the prevalence of mycobacteriosis in ornamental fish sold in pet stores, a total of 122 specimens were sourced from 24 retail suppliers across Trinidad. Fish were killed and internal organs were examined for lesions suggestive of granulomas. All wet-mount slides were acid-fast stained, regardless of the presence or absence of observed granuloma-like lesions. Histological analysis was performed on one randomly selected whole specimen from each facility. Mycobacterium sp. was identified using real-time PCR detecting the 16S rRNA gene in tissue samples. Associations between parasitism, facility biosecurity and presence of positive animals were determined. The prevalence of Mycobacterium sp. infection was 61 ± 7% (74/122), with positive specimens being acquired from 54.2% (13/24) of facilities examined. Further, 100% of facilities did not employ optimum biosecurity measures."
439,Environmental and economic evaluation of remanufacturing lithium-ion batteries from electric vehicles,"Xiong, Siqin; Ji, Junping; Ma, Xiaoming","The environmental threats posed by spent lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) and the future supply risks of battery components for electric vehicles can be simultaneously addressed by remanufacturing spent electric vehicle LIBs. To figure out the feasibility of battery remanufacturing, this paper quantifies the environmental impacts and costs of the remanufacturing of lithium-nickel-manganese-cobalt oxide battery cells and compares the results with the production of batteries from virgin materials. Based on the EverBatt model, a China-specific database of hydrometallurgical remanufacturing process is established. The results indicate that the reductions in energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions by battery remanufacturing are 8.55% and 6.62%, respectively. From the economic standpoint, the potential cost-saving from battery remanufacturing is approximately $1.87 kg(-1) cell produced. Through a sensitivity analysis, LIB remanufacturing is found to be economically viable until the purchase price of spent batteries rises to $2.87 kg(-1). Furthermore, the impact of battery type variability is prominent, whereas the influence of recovery efficiency is limited. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."
440,Indirect effects of COVID-19 on the environment,"Zambrano-Monserrate, Manuel A.; Alejandra Ruano, Maria; Sanchez-Alcalde, Luis","This research aims to show the positive and negative indirect effects of COVID-19 on the environment, particularly in the most affected countries such as China, USA, Italy, and Spain. Our research shows that there is a significant association between contingency measures and improvement in air quality, clean beaches and environmental noise reduction. On the other hand, there are also negative secondary aspects such as the reduction in recycling and the increase in waste, further endangering the contamination of physical spaces (water and land), in addition to air. Global economic activity is expected to return in the coming months in most countries (even if slowly), so decreasing GHG concentrations during a short period is not a sustainable way to clean up our environment."

Small arteries were found to be most sensitive to laser irradiation. The veins of the broad ligament of the uterus demonstrated lower reactivity to laser irradiation of the same duration than arterial vessels, which can be explained by morphological, functional, and hemodynamic differences."
442,CO2 emission in transportation sector across 51 countries along the Belt and Road from 2000 to 2014,"Wang, Chao; Wood, Jacob; Wang, Yongjie; Geng, Xinrui; Long, Xingle","The transportation sector is a key economic sector and an important source of CO2 emissions. Due to these environmental implications and a desire to reduce emission levels, the number of empirical analyses on the transportation sector have increased significantly in recent times. Given this pretext, our study examines the heterogeneity and spatial autocorrelation CO2 emissions of the transportation sector for 51 belt and road economies from 2000 to 2014. As part of analysis, we examine the heterogeneity of CO2 emissions in the transportation sector through the use of the Theil index and semi-variogram analysis. Furthermore, our study also analyzed the global and local spatial autocorrelation of transport sector CO2 emissions using the Moran index for participating countries. From the analysis, this study found that the transportation CO2 emission intensity of Central and Western Asia and North Africa is significantly higher than that of other regions along the belt and road, and there is a strong spatial correlation in Southeast Asian countries. Our research provides a key reference point for governments by proposing carbon-reduction policies and the promotion of greener developmental initiatives within the transportation sector.

A total of 9968 measurements of height, weight, and head circumference, as well as calculation of body mass index (BMI) were used to create growth charts and tables of percentiles. Growth curves were elaborated using Cole's LMS method. The mean weight and length at birth did not differ by sex: the weight was 2750 g for boys and 2710 g for girls (p > 0.05), and the length was 48.2 cm for boys and 47.9 cm for girls (p > 0.05). The mean final height at 18 years was different by sex: 149.6 cm for boys and 141.2 cm for girls. The average BMI at 18 years was 24.2 kg/m2 for boys and 21.9 kg/m2 for girls. In a comparison with U.S. growth charts, we find that the Mexican population has lower height and weight. These are the first growth curves for the Mexican population with DS. They can be used by health care providers to optimize preventive care by monitoring children with DS for the early identification of factors that affect individual growth."
444,A life cycle cost model for floating offshore wind farms,"Maienza, C.; Avossa, A. M.; Ricciardelli, F.; Coiro, D.; Troise, G.; Georgakis, C. T.","Over the last few decades, there has been a renewed interest in the offshore wind sector. In particular, floating wind turbines represent the next frontier in the wind power industry. Currently, only research prototypes exist, and few studies are available on their possible investment cost. Therefore, a cost assessment for this technology is necessary to ascertain whether it is economically sustainable. This paper develops a life cycle cost model for floating offshore wind farms, bringing together the most up-to-date data and parametric equations from data-bases and literature. The cost model considers the key parameters of the wind power economy, namely CAPEX, OPEX, DECEX and LCOE. The proposed model should be helpful for future decision-making, as the wind energy industry is in constant evolution. An application to an offshore floating wind farms is also carried out, in which the three main types of floaters are considered, namely the Semi-Submersible Platform, the Spar Buoy and the Tension Leg Platform. An average LCOE of 9.74 c/kWh was found, at the lower bound of the typical range applying to fixed base offshore wind farms, and higher than typical values applying to onshore wind farms."
445,Mining is bad for health: a voyage of discovery,"Stewart, Alex G.","Mining continues to be a dangerous activity, whether large-scale industrial mining or small-scale artisanal mining. Not only are there accidents, but exposure to dust and toxins, along with stress from the working environment or managerial pressures, give rise to a range of diseases that affect miners. I look at mining and health from various personal perspectives: that of the ordinary man (much of life depends on mined elements in the house, car and phone); as a member of the Society for Environmental Geochemistry and Health (environmental contamination and degradation leads to ill health in nearby communities); as a public health doctor (mining health is affected by many factors, usually acting in a mix, ranging from individual inheritance-genetic makeup, sex, age; personal choices-diet, lifestyle; living conditions-employment, war; social support-family, local community; environmental conditions-education, work; to national and international constraints-trade, economy, natural world); as a volunteer (mining health costs are not restricted to miners or industry but borne by everyone who partakes of mining benefits-all of us); and as a lay preacher (the current global economy concentrates on profit at the expense of the health of miners). Partnership working by academics with communities, government and industry should develop evidence-based solutions. Employment, health, economic stability and environmental protection need not be mutually exclusive. We all need to act."
446,Design and comparative exergy and exergo-economic analyses of a novel integrated Kalina cycle improved with fuel cell and thermoelectric module,"Malik, Muhammad Zeeshan; Musharavati, Farayi; Khanmohammadi, Shoaib; Pakseresht, A. H.; Khanmohammadi, Saber; Dinh Duc Nguyen","Combined cooling, heating, and power systems (CCHP) have attracted a lot of attention due to their distinctive advantages of high system and economic efficiencies in addition to less greenhouse gas emissions. The current study investigates the performance of a Kalina cycle-based CCHP system in which geothermal energy is utilized as the low temperature source of prime energy. A thermoelectric generator is used in the system for retrieving wasted heat and producing extra amount of electricity thereby leading to higher overall efficiency. Two types of fluids, i.e. geothermal water and mixture of water-ammonia, are employed for the steam cycle and Kalina cycle, respectively. A comparative performance analysis is carried out on three system configurations, namely; basic Kalina cycle system, Kalina cycle with a thermoelectric generator (TEG), and Kalina cycle integrated with TEG and a Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cell (PEMFC). The results demonstrated that employing TEG increases the output power by 25.1 kW and improves cycle efficiency by 1.7%. Moreover, integrating both TEG and PEMFC increases the net output power of the proposed system to 1101 kW, which is 993.2 kW and 971.7 kW higher than the basic Kalina cycle system and the Kalina cycle system coupled with the TEG respectively. In addition, the exergy analysis of each component in the system showed that the condenser has the most exergy destruction. Multi-criteria optimization is applied to seek the optimum operation condition of the proposed system. The net output power and electricity cost were used as two critical optimization targets. An optimum condition of the system is suggested using the concept of ideal point on the Pareto front plot."

Its main protease, 3C-like protease (3CLpro), is an attractive target for drug design, due to its importance in virus replication. The analysis of the radial distribution function of 159 3CLpro structures reveals a high similarity index. A study of the catalytic pocket of 3CLpro with bound inhibitors reveals that the influence of the inhibitors is local, perturbing dominantly only residues in the active pocket. A machine learning based model with high predictive ability against SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro is designed and validated. The model is used to perform a drug-repurposing study, with the main aim to identify existing drugs with the highest 3CLpro inhibition power. Among antiviral agents, lopinavir, idoxuridine, paritaprevir, and favipiravir showed the highest inhibition potential. Enzyme - ligand interactions as a key ingredient for successful drug design."

Therefore, semi-structured interviews were conducted with individuals and entities related to the EPA. The snowball method complemented the mapping of non-official social actors. The discussion was based on the critical approach of environmental education, polycentric governance, adaptive management, environmental advocacy and case studies about education in protected areas. Results showed nine key stakeholders to be considered in a network program for the EPA's participatory management, including government, schools, local and nearby residents and religious groups. In the end, we recommend the hosting of a one day workshop, built around existing local and national environmental goals, as an entry point for trust building and the search for shared interests."

Inhibition of viral cytopathic effect (CPE) increased with increasing the concentration of β-pinene, which attested to direct elimination of adenovirus type 3. During viral reproduction phase, β-pinene significantly inhibited proliferation of adenovirus type 3. Typical signs of adenoviral CPE as cell swelling and rounding were less pronounced in comparison with the control (ribavirin treatment). In addition, elevation of β-pinene concentration significantly increased the cell survival rate (p<0.05). Laser confocal microscopy showed that fluorescence intensity in the β-pinene group was significantly lower than in the control group (p<0.01), which was consistent with the results of MTT test, thereby providing additional arguments that β-pinene affects the virus during the absorption phase. Thus, β-pinene directly inactivates adenovirus type 3 and impedes its invasion into the cells, but produces no protective effects on cells. Understanding the mode of action of such monoterpenes as β-pinene is of great importance for the development of new antiviral drugs."
450,Household-based critical influence factors of biogas generation technology utilization: A case of Punjab province of Pakistan,"Jabeen, Gul; Yan, Qingyou; Ahmad, Munir; Fatima, Nousheen; Jabeen, Maria; Li, Heng; Qamar, Shoaib","This research comprehensively examined the contributions of households' critical influence factors (CRIFs) in BGT utilization. The data based on a sample of 695 households from seven selected districts of Punjab province of Pakistan. The empirical findings are: first, among the households' preference based CRIFs, cooking as a utilization mode imparted positive and significant influence on BGT utilization. It implicated that cooking was found to be the dominant preference of households to utilize the BGT. Moreover, the health risk factor was exposed to be important in BGT utilization. This is likely for people to attach importance to their health. Second, dual nature of the influence of gender is observed: (i) it emphasized the role of woman empowerment in choice of BGT, and also, (ii) as the females need to spend extra time in fuel collection, they want to switch to BGT. Third, concerning the socio-economic and infrastructural influence factors, the education of both household head and chef portrayed a positive influence on BGT utilization. Moreover, households with relatively more land ownership and livestock were more probable to utilize BGT. Finally, the users of the BGT experienced the financial, health, environmental protection, and crop harvest benefits as compared to non-users of BGT. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."

Physically, such systems are microemulsions that in general have a propensity to fuse and coalesce; however, many condensates persist as independent droplets in the test tube and inside cells. This stability is crucial for their function, but the physicochemical mechanisms that control the emulsion stability of condensates remain poorly understood. Here, by combining single-condensate zeta potential measurements, optical microscopy, tweezer experiments, and multiscale molecular modeling, we investigate how the nanoscale forces that sustain condensates impact their stability against fusion. By comparing peptide-RNA (PR25:PolyU) and proteinaceous (FUS) condensates, we show that a higher condensate surface charge correlates with a lower fusion propensity. Moreover, measurements of single condensate zeta potentials reveal that such systems can constitute classically stable emulsions. Taken together, these results highlight the role of passive stabilization mechanisms in protecting biomolecular condensates against coalescence."

We contribute to the literature by: (1) computing different indicators of environmental policy stringency, (2) testing to what extent they convey similar insights through a statistical comparison exercise, and (3) showing the implications of using one or the other indicator in two illustrative empirical applications focused on environmental innovation and energy efficiency. We conclude by highlighting the implications of our analysis for empirical research focusing on the evaluation of policy impacts, and highlight fruitful future research avenues."

The aim of this pilot study was a systematic search for two lines of antihypertensive treatment - a monotherapy and a combination of two drugs - to be applied in a future study on old SHR. Originally, representatives of three drug classes recommended for antihypertensive therapy in humans should be applied, namely captopril (CAP) as an antagonist of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, nifedipine (NIF) as calcium channel blocker and propranolol (PROP) as β-adrenergic blocker. As we observed that PROP had been poorly ingested, all groups with PROP therapy were excluded from the study. CAP (60 mg kg-1 d-1), NIF (10 mg kg-1 d-1) or both were administered orally to seven-week-old SHR over 3 weeks. A further group of SHR received no treatment (SHR/CTRL). Age-matched normotensive Wistar-Kyoto rats served as normotensive controls. We examined the effect of the antihypertensive therapies on systolic blood pressure, heart weight and on histological and biochemical markers of cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis. CAP proved to be the most effective treatment reducing blood pressure and relative heart weight significantly compared to SHR/CTRL without reaching normotensive values. Beginning cardiac fibrosis observed in SHR/CTRL was completely abrogated with CAP treatment. Similar effects were achieved with a combination of CAP and NIF. CAP as monotherapy and CAP + NIF as combination therapy were chosen for the forthcoming study on old SHR."

On January 23 in Wuhan, and later in all other cities of the country, there were taken measures to control the spread of the virus through quarantine measures. This article focused on East China and attempted to assess comprehensively the environmental impact of the COVID-19 outbreak. This study analyzed satellite observational data of sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), carbon monoxide (CO) and aerosol optical depth (AOD) in the period before the outbreak of the epidemic and during the implementation of preventive measures and control of COVID-19, as well as compared it with the data obtained in the same period of 2019. The results of the analysis showed that the COVID-19 lockdown improved air quality in the short term, but as soon as coal consumption at power plants and refineries returned to normal levels due to the resumption of their work, pollution levels returned to their previous level. The levels of CO and NO2 showed the most significant decrease (20 and 30%), since they were mainly associated with a decrease in economic growth and transport restrictions that led to a change in energy consumption and a reduction in emissions. This study can complement the scientific community and environmental protection policy makers, not only to assess the impact of outbreak on air quality, but also for its effectiveness as a simple alternative program of action to improve air quality."

Each of the submitted calves had moderate-to-severe hemorrhage within various tissues and body cavities, including the thymus, subcutaneous region of the neck, mediastinum, lungs, pericardial sac, heart, spleen, perirenal fat, urinary bladder, and skeletal muscle, including the diaphragm. An anticoagulant rodenticide screen was performed on the livers of each calf. Significant concentrations of chlorophacinone were detected at 4.2, 3.6, and 2.9 ppm in liver. Multiple piles and an open pail of white powdery material were present within the facility in which the calves were housed and were identified as the sources of chlorophacinone. Acute hemorrhage and death occurred in fourteen 1.5-mo-old, crossbred calves following ingestion of the vitamin K antagonist chlorophacinone."
456,Responding to the Essential Sexual and Reproductive Health Needs for Women During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Literature Review,"Mona Larki,Farangis Sharifi,Elham Manouchehri,Robab Latifnejad Roudsari,Mona Larki,Farangis Sharifi,Elham Manouchehri,Robab Latifnejad Roudsari","The pandemic and its consequences have been shown to have a negative impact on the availability and accessibility of the basic services, including sexual and reproductive health (SRH) needs. The aim of this study was to investigate the responses to the essential SRH needs for women during the COVID-19 pandemic. This narrative review was conducted based on the Scale for Assessing Narrative Review Articles (SANRA), in order to present key activities for responding to the important SRH needs of women in the current COVID-19 pandemic. The literature search was performed through English databases of Cochrane Library, PubMed, Scopus and ScienceDirect, as well as Persian databases including Magiran and Scientific Information Database (SID). In addition, the World Health Organization (WHO), the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV and AIDS (UNAIDS) and the reports of Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) were searched. The search was carried out from December 2019 up to 10 January 2021. Essential reproductive healthcare services for women during the COVID-19 pandemic were divided into six categories including access to contraception, safe abortion and post-abortion care, sexual health and sexually transmitted disease (STD) prevention, cervical cancer screening and prevention, maternity services and also addressing violence against women and girls. These essential needs should be considered as a priority by governments as well as public and private stakeholders. It seems that the implementation of the shifted strategies, active participation of public and private stakeholders, consideration of human rights and ethical issues, ensuring access to vulnerable populations, regular contact with individuals and the increased cooperation of individuals for responding to the SRH needs during the COVID-19 outbreak, are necessary."
457,Will income inequality influence the abatement effect of renewable energy technological innovation on carbon dioxide emissions?,"Bai, Caiquan; Feng, Chen; Yan, Hong; Yi, Xing; Chen, Zhujun; Wei, Wendong","Environmental pollution and income inequality have become two salient issues in China. To achieve a green economic transformation, China urgently needs to develop renewable energy technologies to reduce carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. However, the relationship among income inequality, renewable energy technological innovation (RETI) and CO2 emissions has not received sufficient attention in the current literature. Based on Chinese provincial panel data from 2000 to 2015, this paper adopts a panel fixed effect regression model and a panel threshold model to perform an analysis on the nonlinear relationship among these factors. The results show that (1) RETI is conducive to reducing per capita CO2 emissions (PCE). However, with an increase in income inequality, the abatement effect of RETI on per capita CO2 emissions will be hindered, and RETI will even positively contribute to PCE. (2) The panel threshold model shows that the impact of RETI on PCE has a significant single-threshold effect with regard to income inequality. When income inequality is lower than the threshold value, the impact of RETI on PCE is not significant. However, above the threshold value, that is, within the interval of higher income inequality, an increase in RETI will positively contribute to PCE. Finally, from the perspectives of income inequality and RETI, relevant policy implications are put forward for achieving the transformation of a low-carbon economy."
458,A systematic decision -making approach for planning and assessment of hybrid renewable energy -based microgrid with techno-economic optimization: A case study on an urban community in Egypt,"Elkadeem, M. R.; Wang, Shaorong; Azmy, Ahmed M.; Atiya, Eman G.; Ullah, Zia; Sharshir, Swellam W.","This paper proposes a systematic and integrative decision-making approach for efficient planning and assessment of hybrid renewable energy-based microgrid (HRE-MG) systems. The approach is combined with an extensive techno-economic optimization analysis. The proposed methodology is validated with an actual case study on an urban city in Egypt, with the developed HRE-MG comprising solar, wind, diesel, and fuel cell energies. Different hybridization scenarios are modeled, evaluated and compared to obtain the most practicable solution with minimum cost and emission impact. The obtained results reveal that solar, wind, fuel cell show optimal configuration plan that yields a minimum net present and energy costs. Also, it achieves a significant reduction in carbon gases and increases system renewable fraction compared to other scenarios. Further, the reliability of the proposed hybrid energy system is examined under loss of power supply probability concept. A sensitivity analysis is then conducted to verify the model accuracy and examine the cost performance of the designed system concerning uncertain parameters."
459,Assessment of flash flood risk based on improved analytic hierarchy process method and integrated maximum likelihood clustering algorithm,"Lin, Kairong; Chen, Haiyan; Xu, Chong-Yu; Yan, Ping; Lan, Tian; Liu, Zhiyong; Dong, Chunyu","Flash floods are one of the most severe natural disasters throughout the world, and are responsible for sizeable social and economic losses, as well as countless injuries and death. Risk assessment, which identifies areas susceptible to flooding, has been shown to be an effective tool for managing and mitigating flash floods. The study aims to introduce the methods to determine the weights of the risk indices, and identify the different risk clusters. In this regard, we proposed a methodology for comprehensively assessing flash flood risk in a GIS environment, by the improved analytic hierarchy process (IAHP) method, and an integration of iterative self-organizing data (ISODATA) analysis and maximum likelihood (ISO-Maximum) clustering algorithm. The weight for each risk index is determined by the IAHP, which integrates the subjective characteristics with objective attributes of the assessment data. Based on the data mining technology, the integration of ISO-Maximum clustering algorithm derives a more reasonable classification. The Guangdong Province of China was selected for testing the proposed method's applicability, and we used a receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve approach to validate the modeling of the flash-flood risk distribution. The validation against the historical flash flood data indicates a high reliability of this method for comprehensive flash flood risk assessment. In order to verify the proposed method's superiority, in addition, the technique for order performance by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) and the weights-of-evidence (WE) methods are used for comparison with the IAHP and ISO-Maximum clustering algorithm method. Moreover, we analyzed and compared the regularity of flash floods in the rural and urban areas. This study not only provides a new approach for large-scale flash flood comprehensive risk assessment, but also assists researchers and local decision-makers in designing flash flood mitigation strategies."
460,The moderating role of energy consumption in the carbon emissions-income nexus in middle-income countries,"Ehigiamusoe, Kizito Uyi; Lean, Hooi Hooi; Smyth, Russell","We examine the role of energy consumption in moderating the carbon dioxide emissions-income nexus in 64 middle income countries and compute the marginal effects of real GDP per capita on carbon dioxide emissions at various levels of energy consumption. To do so, we employ multiplicative interaction models because the traditional quadratic Environmental Kuznets Curve model cannot capture the marginal effects. We also use empirical techniques that can account for cross-sectional dependence, such as the Westerlund cointegration test and the Augmented Mean Group estimator. While the marginal effects of GDP on carbon dioxide emissions at the minimum, mean and maximum levels of energy consumption are 9.996, 9.210 and 8.452, respectively, we find no significant evidence that energy consumption moderates the relationship between income and carbon emissions in the panel. However, when we focus on specific countries, we find that energy consumption moderates the nexus between carbon emissions and income in roughly one-third of our sample and that the moderating effect is negative in about one fifth of the sample. We conclude with a discussion on why the moderating effect of energy consumption on the carbon emissions-income nexus differs between countries and offer some policy recommendations that are grounded in the main findings."

Y4.1MC1","Jinzhao Shang,Shuohao Yue,Fang Zeng,Yun Chen,Longgang Jia,Jinzhao Shang,Shuohao Yue,Fang Zeng,Yun Chen,Longgang Jia","β-hydroxybutyric acid is the most sensitive indicator in ketoacidosis detection, and accounts for nearly 78% of the ketone bodies. Diaphorase is commonly used to detect the β-hydroxybutyric acid in clinical diagnosis. However, the extraction of diaphorase from animal myocardium is complex and low-yield, which is not convenient for large-scale production. In this study, a diaphorase from Geobacillus sp. Y4.1MC1 was efficiently heterologous expressed and purified in E. coli with a yield of 110 mg/L culture. The optimal temperature and pH of this recombinant diaphorase (rDIA) were 55 °C and 6.5, respectively. It was proved that rDIA was a dual acid- and thermo-stable enzyme, and which showed much more accurate detection of β-hydroxybutyric acid than the commercial enzyme. Additionally, we also investigated the molecular interaction of rDIA with the substrate, and the conformation transition in different pH values by using homology modeling and molecular dynamics simulation. The results showed that 141-161 domain of rDIA played important role in the structure changes and conformations transmission at different pH values. Moreover, it was predicted that F105W, F105R, and M186R mutants were able to improve the binding affinity of rDIA, and A2Y, P35F, Q36D, N210L, F211Y mutants were benefit for the stability of rDIA."
462,Analysis of microplastics in a remote region of the Tibetan Plateau: Implications for natural environmental response to human activities,"Feng, Sansan; Lu, Hongwei; Tian, Peipei; Xue, Yuxuan; Lu, Jingzhao; Tang, Meng; Feng, Wei","Microplastics are one of the most valuable indicators reflecting the effects of human activities on natural environment. This study was conducted in a representative remote region of Tibetan Plateau in China, simultaneously analyzing the abundance, compositions and fate of MPs both in water and soil media. MPs were detected in surface water, sediment and soil with abundances ranging from 66.6 to 7333 number/m(3), 20 to 160 items/kg, and 20 to 110 items/kg, respectively. Fibers were the most frequently observed shape in the surface water and sediment, while the dominant shape in the soil was film. The major polymers of MPs in water and soil samples were polypropylene (PP) and polyethylene (PE). Small MPs were the main components with the <500 mu m fraction accounting for 94.74%, 88.37% and 88.34% of total MP particles in surface water, sediment and soil, respectively. Correlation analysis was further conducted to identify the sources of MPs from different human activities. The night light index was innovatively used to represent population rather than local residents, considering the large number of tourists in this region. It was found that tourism was the main source of MPs in water bodies, while facility agriculture and previous secondary industry are major contributors to soil MPs. A simplified equation set for MP abundance prediction was also formulated related to different industrial features. This study provides an evidence of noticeable MPs associated with human activities even at remote regions, and advances a feasible tool for MPs prediction according to local economic development. Capsule: The effect of human activities on natural environment in a remote region was illustrated by evaluating the abundance, compositions and fate of MPs across freshwater and terrestrial environment.

463,"Factors affecting household food waste among young consumers and actions to prevent it. A comparison among UK, Spain and Italy","Bravi, Laura; Francioni, Barbara; Murmura, Federica; Savelli, Elisabetta","Food waste is a critical issue with multiple ethical, environmental and economic consequences. The aim of this study is to investigate which factors most affect food waste and determine what actions are undertaken to prevent it at the household level. The study, while privileging a behavioural perspective, focuses on the overall consumption process, from purchasing through final food consumption, thus assuming a broad perspective. The data for this study were collected among Italian, Spanish and English populations using three public online questionnaires administered from January to September 2017. This resulted in a total of 3323 usable questionnaires referring to a sample population aged between 18 and 35 years. As for the main motivation to waste food, the research findings provide strong evidence of the importance of in-store behaviour and food management at home in reducing the frequency of food waste in all the three countries examined. As for the actions preventing food waste, the consumption of leftovers appears as a relevant determinant in minimising food waste. The findings confirm that food waste is a complex issue that requires a broad approach of analysis considering several factors simultaneously. The study also provides further insights regarding the relationship between eating outside the home and food waste, which is a topic of debate in the extant literature. Finally, the study improves the overall knowledge about actions that prevent food waste, which have previously been poorly investigated."
464,"The impacts of globalization, financial development, government expenditures, and institutional quality on CO2 emissions in the presence of environmental Kuznets curve","Hoang Phong Le; Ozturk, Ilhan","The main objective of this study is to examine the impacts of globalization, financial development, government expenditures, and institutional quality on CO2 emissions, incorporating energy consumption, and GDP per capita in the Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) model for 47 Emerging Market and Developing Economies (EMDEs) between 1990 and 2014. Owing to the presence of cross-sectional dependence and slope heterogeneity in the panel data, CADF and CIPS unit root tests are employed to validate the stationarity of the variables. Westerlund (Oxf Bull Econ Stat 69:709-748, 2007) and Banerjee and Carrion-i-Silvestre (J Time Ser Anal 38:610-636, 2017) cointegration tests denote the occurrence of cointegration among the variables. We employed CCEMG, AMG, and DCCE estimators to estimate heterogeneous parameters. The findings demonstrate that globalization, financial development, and energy consumption increase CO2 emissions. Besides, the EKC hypothesis is affirmed in EMDEs. The accrual of governments' financial and governance activities also boosts carbon dioxide emissions. Moreover, the analysis of Dumitrescu and Hurlin causality provides evidences for the feedbacks among the variables and CO2 emissions. From the aforementioned results, there exists the trade-off effect between economic growth and environmental quality in EMDE countries. Finally, the empirical findings of this study indicate profound implications for policy makers, which recommend governments to consider the role of finance and governance in order to ensure that energy consumption, financial development, and sustainable economic growth are in harmony with the environment in the globalization era."
465,The Sources of Political Normativity: the Case for Instrumental and Epistemic Normativity in Political Realism,"Carlo Burelli,Chiara Destri,Carlo Burelli,Chiara Destri","This article argues that political realists have at least two strategies to provide distinctively political normative judgements that have nothing to do with morality. The first ground is instrumental normativity, which states that if we believe that something is a necessary means to a goal we have, we have a reason to do it. In politics, certain means are required by any ends we may intend to pursue. The second ground is epistemic normativity, stating that if something is (empirically) true, this gives us a reason to believe it. In politics, there are certain empirical regularities that ought to be acknowledged for what they are. Both sources are flawed. Instrumental normativity only requires coherence between attitudes and beliefs, and one can hang on to false beliefs to preserve attitudes incompatible with reality. I may desire to eschew power relations, and accordingly I may imagine politics to be like a camping trip. Epistemic normativity, on the other hand, operates critically, striking down existing normative claims. It shows us that politics is nothing like a camping trip, but it doesn't tell us what we should do about it (beyond abandoning some false beliefs). We conclude by showing that if the two are taken together, they remedy each other's flaws."
466,Renewable hydrogen production: A techno-economic comparison of photoelectrochemical cells and photovoltaic-electrolysis,"Grimm, Alexa; de Jong, Wouter A.; Kramer, Gert Jan","The present paper reports a techno-economic analysis of two solar assisted hydrogen production technologies: a photoelectrochemical (PEC) system and its major competitor, a photovoltaic system connected to a conventional water electrolyzer (PV-E system). A comparison between these two types was performed to identify the more promising technology based on the levelized cost of hydrogen (LCOH). The technical evaluation was carried out by considering proven designs and materials for the PV-E system, and a conceptually design for the PEC system extrapolated to future, commercial scale. The LCOH for the off-grid PV-E system was found to be 6.22 $/kg(H2), with a solar to hydrogen efficiency of 10.9%. For the PEC system, with a similar efficiency of 10%, the LCOH was calculated to be much higher, namely 8.43 $/kg(H2). A sensitivity analysis reveals a great uncertainty in the LCOH of the prospective PEC system. This implies that much effort would be needed for this technology to become competitive on the market. Therefore we conclude that the potential techno-economic benefits that PEC systems offer over PV-E are uncertain, and even in the best case, limited. While research into photoelectrochemical cells remains of interest, it presents a poor case for dedicated investment in the technology's development and scale-up. (c) 2020 The Author(s).

467,COVID-19 outbreak and the role of digital twin,"Saleh Alrashed,Nasro Min-Allah,Ijaz Ali,Rashid Mehmood,Saleh Alrashed,Nasro Min-Allah,Ijaz Ali,Rashid Mehmood","COVID-19 has transformed the life of human beings and digital twin infrastructure can facilitates working remotely during COVID-19 outbreak by reducing burden on services and infrastructure. Currently, many organizations are installing and developing devices such as thermal cameras, sensors aiming to minimize human contact and so forth, in addition to enforcing social distancing resulting in reducing the risk of transmission. Due to economic reasons, lockdown restrictions are being relaxed/lifted in many countries and Pakistan which is one of the most densely populated countries in the world with a population of 220 + million is no exception. Though, Pakistan contained the first two waves of coronavirus infections reasonably well but the country is struggling to contain the third wave of the spread due to violations of social distancing norms. While our predictions may deviate from official statistics due to lack of mass testing and existence of asymptomatic infections, the described approach predicts the possible actual burden of infection over times. In view of the unique demographics, our data quantify the efficacy of social distancing as an effective measure to forestall the infection. We highlight few areas where digital twins can be created/deployed to provide services and essential facilities to citizens as COVID-19 is expected to have permanent impact on the way we work."
468,Recycled aggregates from construction and demolition wastes as alternative filling materials for highway subgrades in China,"Zhang, Junhui; Ding, Le; Li, Feng; Peng, Junhui","With the rapid advancement of urbanization in China, a huge amount of construction and demolition wastes (CDW) are generated. Recycling CDW into subgrade materials is a promising way to process these wastes, with significant environmental and economic benefits. But very little work has been done in this field. Therefore, based on a CDW subgrade construction case in Beijing, the physical and chemical properties of the CDW materials were analyzed. Then the construction procedures of the CDW subgrade were presented, and a series of tests (compaction degree test, settlement observation, Portable Falling Weight Deflectometer test) were carried out. At the same time, the effects of different loose paving thicknesses, cycles of strong vibration on the subgrade performances were assayed. Subsequently, grading analysis of the CDW particles, plate load test and Beckman beam deflection test were performed to evaluate the construction quality. According to the test results, the construction technologies of the CDW subgrade, such as the optimum loose paving thicknesses and cycles of strong vibration, were determined. And then, the post-construction settlement monitor and radar survey were conducted for subgrades filled with CDW and soil to further analyze the applicability of CDW. The results show that recycled CDW aggregates with proper grading and strict construction technologies perform well. The subgrade filled with recycled CDW has a smaller deformation than that of the soil subgrade. Finally, the life cycle assessments (LCA) of two treating schemes of CDW were conducted to analyze the environmental benifits: recycling utilization as subgrade materials and directly landfilling. If the subgrade is filled with the recycled CDW aggregates, CDW will be consumed in large quantities and the environmental impactions of eutrophication and ecotoxicity can be reduced obviously.

The taxonomic status of Ficuskrishnae is still unclear and currently treated as a subspecies or variety under Ficusbenghalensis. In the present study, morphological characters and molecular analysis were employed to address their species delimitation. The spacer markers ITS2 and trnH-psbA were used for constructing phylogenetic trees along with morphometric analysis. Ficuskrishnae distinctly differs from Ficusbenghalensis by having cup-forming leaves and the nature of the aerial roots, stipules, petioles, ostiolar bracts of the receptacle, DNA content, chromosome differences and nodal anatomy. The results showed that the highest divergence is observed in trnH-psbA (20.8 ± 12.2), followed by ITS2 (5.7 ± 3.2). The phylogenetic tree construction using Bayesian analysis showed a divergent boundary between the two species suggesting that F.krishnae could be an independent species, not a variety of F.benghalensis. The present study's findings support the view that these two floras can be treated as different species."

According to the high-throughput sequencing data, we found that the copy number variation region of the GAL3ST1 gene was correlated with the growth traits of bovine. It is significant that we study the CNV of GAL3ST1 gene and process the association analysis between results of Q-PCR and growth traits of Chinese cattle. In this research, SPSS software was used to detect the distribution of GAL3ST1 gene copy number in four cattle breeds and the correlation of growth traits was analyzed. Correlation analysis showed that GAL3ST1 CNV had positive effects on some growth traits of bovine (p < 0.05). In addition, the study detects the expression of GAL3ST1 gene in different tissues of Xia'nan cattles on mRNA level. The result showed that GAL3ST1 gene has different expression conditions in different tissues, results showed that the expression level was high in intestine and low in liver tissue. In a word, we speculated that the GAL3ST1 gene can be used as a molecular marker and this study confirmed that the CNV of it can provide theoretical basis for molecular breeding of cattle in China."
471,Managing the water-energy-food nexus in China by adjusting critical final demands and supply chains: An input-output analysis,"Deng, Hong-Mei; Wang, Can; Cai, Wen-Jia; Liu, Yuan; Zhang, Li-Xiao","The rapid population growth in China has increased the demand for limited water, energy and food resources. Because the resource supply is constrained by future uncertainties such as climate change, it is necessary to examine the connections among water, energy and food resources from the perspective of the relevant final demands. Based on an input-output model and structural path analysis, this study aims to explore the hidden connections among water, energy and food resources by identifying important final demands and examine how these resources are embodied in upstream production and downstream consumption processes along the supply chain. The water-energy-food nexus approach in this research identifies where and how these resources intersect in economic sectors. By simultaneously considering the water, energy and food footprints, synergistic effects can be maximized among these resource systems. The results reveal that urban household consumption and fixed capital formation have large impacts on water-energy-food resources. Besides, agriculture, construction and service sectors have the largest water-energy-food footprints. For each resource, we rank the top-20 supply chain paths from the final demands to the upstream production sectors, and six critical supply chain paths are identified as important contributors to the consumption of all these resources. Compared with independent approach to manage water, energy and food resources, the nexus approach identifies the critical linkages of the water, energy and food systems and helps to formulate integrated policies to effectively manage these resources across sectors and actors. Synergistic strategies for conserving water, energy, and food resources can be achieved through avoiding unnecessary waste in end uses and improving resource use efficiency along critical supply chains. This research can help consumers, industries and the government make responsible consumption and production decisions to conserve water, energy and food resources. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

However, genetic tests only focus on CSHL. We try to identify the common molecular mechanism of CSHL and microtia as candidates combining gene diagnosis biomarkers. Whole-exon sequencing (WES), Sanger sequencing, qPCR, and bioinformatics analyses were performed in microtia family (F1), family two, whose proband suffered from microtia and CSHL (F2), five microtia, and four CSHL individuals, respectively. We found that 40% microtia and 40% CSHL relevant genes were detected in F1 and a sharing pathway: the sensory perception of sound was identified. Moreover, the copy number variation in proband F2 was identified in one gene of the sharing pathway: EYA1. Meanwhile, two variants of BUB3 were identified in F1 data. BUB3 is related to development, dog ear type, direct and indirect interaction with microtia, and CSHL relevant genes. Notably, although the allele frequency of two variants of BUB3 showed significant differences between microtia and CSHL, the special microtia-relevant genotype also could be detected in one CSHL sample. These results suggest that the sensory perception of sound and the development of relevant pathways may be the common pathways of microtia and CSHL. Genes of these pathways can be used as candidates combining gene diagnosis biomarkers."

474,A New Socio-economic Indicator to Measure the Performance of Bioeconomy Sectors in Europe,"D'Adamo, Idiano; Falcone, Pasquale Marcello; Morone, Piergiuseppe","The European Commission supports the production of renewable biological resources and their conversion into value added products and bio-energy. A new bioeconomy strategy aimed at promoting a sustainable Europe was launched in October 2018. However, little work has been done to monitor, model and appraise the impacts and developmental trajectories of bioeconomy sectors. To gauge the current sustainability performance of individual European countries, the present study proposes a new indicator - the ""socio-economic indicator for the bioeconomy"" (SEIB) - to measure the socio-economic performance of bioeconomy sectors. Drawing on Eurostat data and the analytic hierarchy process, multi-criteria decision analysis is employed with the aim of providing a direct comparison between member states (MSs). However, bioeconomy involves a large number of sectors and, therefore, it is useful to propose two versions of this indicator in order also to single out the impact of most innovative sectors: the first version considers all bio-based sectors (""SEIB for overall sectors"") while the second version excludes all primary sectors (""SEIB for manufacturing and bio-energy sectors""). The results identify three groups of MSs (virtuous, in-between and laggard) with reference to the European average. Ireland occupies the first position in the ranking, and only three other MSs (Denmark, Portugal and Austria) qualify as ""virtuous"" countries in both rankings."
475,"Assessment of Energy Systems Using Extended Fuzzy AHP, Fuzzy VIKOR, and TOPSIS Approaches to Manage Non-Cooperative Opinions","Taylan, Osman; Alamoudi, Rami; Kabli, Mohammad; AlJifri, Alawi; Ramzi, Fares; Herrera-Viedma, Enrique","Energy systems planning commonly involves the study of supply and demand of power, forecasting the trends of parameters established on economics and technical criteria of models. Numerous measures are needed for the fulfillment of energy system assessment and the investment plans. The higher energy prices which call for diversification of energy systems and managing the resolution of conflicts are the results of high energy demand for growing economies. Due to some challenging problems of fossil fuels, energy production and distribution from alternative sources are getting more attention. This study aimed to reveal the most proper energy systems in Saudi Arabia for investment. Hence, integrated fuzzy AHP (Analytic Hierarchy Process), fuzzy VIKOR (Vlse Kriterijumska Optimizacija Kompromisno Resenje) and TOPSIS (Technique for Order Preferences by Similarity to Idle Solution) methodologies were employed to determine the most eligible energy systems for investment. Eight alternative energy systems were assessed against nine criteria-power generation capacity, efficiency, storability, safety, air pollution, being depletable, net present value, enhanced local economic development, and government support. Data were collected using the Delphi method, a team of three decision-makers (DMs) was established in a heterogeneous manner with the addition of nine domain experts to carry out the analysis. The fuzzy AHP approach was used for clarifying the weight of criteria and fuzzy VIKOR and TOPSIS were utilized for ordering the alternative energy systems according to their investment priority. On the other hand, sensitivity analysis was carried out to determine the priority of investment for energy systems and comparison of them using the weight of group utility and fuzzy DEA (Data Envelopment Analysis) approaches. The results and findings suggested that solar photovoltaic (PV) is the paramount renewable energy system for investment, according to both fuzzy VIKOR and fuzzy TOPSIS approaches. In this context our findings were compared with other works comprehensively."

Since the Belt and Road Initiative has increasing influence on manufacturing-oriented developing countries, more attention should be paid to carbon emission reduction in these regions. This study conducts a comprehensive analysis by analyzing the carbon inequality and regional development and compares the carbon emissions driven by final demand among countries in and outside the Belt and Road area from 1990 to 2015. It is found that the majority of the Belt and Road regions achieved a rapid GDP growth rate with increasing carbon emissions, in which the investment-driven type demonstrated a significant growth. In contrast, the developed countries outside the Belt and Road area maintained their economic growth while decreasing the carbon emissions owed to the declining of investment-driven emissions; however the consumption-driven emissions stably remained a relatively high level. Our results showed that the inequality of carbon emission within Belt and Road regions is lower than the global average, while the inequality of the investment-driven emissions showed an obviously increasing trend. By discussing the carbon inequality and regional development, rational and feasible strategies for countries and regions within and outside the Belt and Road area are essential, and different types of strategies such as low-carbon technologies transfers and overseas financial cooperation are suggested for regional carbon emission reduction and sustainable regional development under the Belt and Road Initiative."
477,Sustainable circular supplier selection: A novel hybrid approach,"Kannan, Devika; Mina, Hassan; Nosrati-Abarghooee, Saeede; Khosrojerdi, Ghasem","Circular supplier selection is the process of selecting suppliers in a closed-loop supply chain. Sustainable circular supplier selection addresses the social and environmental concerns in circular supplier selection problems. In this paper, for the first time, we combine the fuzzy best-worst method and the interval VIKOR technique to evaluate and prioritize sustainable suppliers in circular supply chains. The evaluation criteria are classified into three categories of economic, social, and circular factors extracted based on the domain expert's opinions. The fuzzy best worst method is used to weigh the criteria, and the interval VIKOR technique is applied to evaluate the suppliers in the presence of uncertainty. This study contributes to the sustainable development goals (SDG's) of providing Decent Work and Economic Growth (SDG 8) and Responsible Consumption and Production (SDG 12). The proposed method is then used to evaluate six suppliers in the wire-and-cable industry in Iran. The results obtained from the implementation of the proposed approach and its sensitivity analysis indicate the applicability and efficiency of the proposed approach. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

478,How Does Firm ESG Performance Impact Financial Constraints? An Experimental Exploration of the COVID-19 Pandemic,"Dongyang Zhang,Cao Wang,Yu Dong,Dongyang Zhang,Cao Wang,Yu Dong","This research assesses the effects of COVID-19-associated shocks on financial constraints and sustainable development goal (SDG) performance to shed light on the impact of SDGs on economic recovery. We construct a large sample of Chinese listed firms from quarterly firm-level accounting data from the China Stock Market & Accounting Research Database for the period 2019Q1-2021Q1, matched with environmental, social, and governance (ESG) scores, SDG performance from the WIND Database, and complemented with data on cumulative and new cases of COVID-19 from the World Health Organization. We use difference-in-differences to investigate any causal effect from COVID-19. We find that COVID-19 induces financial constraints in firms. Further, differing from the existing literature on the determinants of SDGs, we explore the supportive role of SDG performance on firm financial performance and show that ESG can better describe SDG performance and alleviate financial constraints. Moreover, both internal and external financial intermediaries improve with enhanced ESG performance in overcoming financial constraints. Our findings strongly indicate that a sustainable development strategy facilitates efficient adaptation to financial challenges and assists in overcoming external shocks."
479,A new composite climate change vulnerability index,"Edmonds, H. K.; Lovell, J. E.; Lovell, C. A. K.","The earth's climate is changing, with global warming attributable to anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions driven by economic and population growth. Human systems and ecosystems vary in their exposure, mitigation and adaptive capacity, and vulnerability to various forms of climate change. Once mitigation and adaptation efforts have been exhausted, vulnerability remains. Data compiled by the University of Notre Dame covering over 100 nations in 2016 were used to construct a new composite climate change vulnerability index that features endogenously generated weights to aggregate vulnerability indices across six vulnerable sectors. These weights have the potential to inform policy aimed at allocating resources to reduce the cost of limiting vul-nerability. The new composite vulnerability index, whose weights differ across sectors and across nations, is compared with the Notre Dame vulnerability index, which uses weights equal across sectors and constant across nations. Although the two indices agree on the identity of the most vulnerable nations, there is a statistically significant difference between the two indices. In addition, a nonparametric statistical test failed to reject the null hypothesis that one sectoral index could be deleted from the composite index without significant loss of information. This also has potentially important policy implications."
480,"Assessment of city sustainability-Coupling coordinated development among economy, society and environment","Li, Weiwei; Yi, Pingtao","The coordination development among various subsystems, especially among economic, social and environmental subsystems, is an important part of urban sustainability that directly affects the quality of urbanization. This paper evaluated the sustainability of the 9 China's national central cities using the coupling coordination model. In the evaluation process, an objective coupling weighting method was developed by the combination of the coupling analysis and the sequential relationship analysis method. The validity of this method was illustrated by comparing the coordination level of the cities with that obtained by the entropy method. Long-term use of this method can guide the coordination development among economy, society and environment of cities. The assessment results indicate that the coordination development among economy, society and environment of the cities was not ideal. Only one city, Beijing, located in the good coordination grade. The main reason is the lower development of economic sustainability. Policy recommendations were provided to address the problem. In addition, the paper concludes that there is a great room for improvement in the coordinated development of the cities, because they showed an increase trend in coordinated development and the economic growth rate was relatively high.

481,The COVID-19 impact on air condition usage: a shift towards residential energy saving,"Muhammad Saidu Aliero,Muhammad Fermi Pasha,Adel N Toosi,Imran Ghani,Muhammad Saidu Aliero,Muhammad Fermi Pasha,Adel N Toosi,Imran Ghani","The enforcement of the Movement Control Order to curtail the spread of COVID-19 has affected home energy consumption, especially HVAC systems. Occupancy detection and estimation have been recognized as key contributors to improving building energy efficiency. Several solutions have been proposed for the past decade to improve the precision performance of occupancy detection and estimation in the building. Environmental sensing is one of the practical solutions to detect and estimate occupants in the building during uncertain behavior. However, the literature reveals that the performance of environmental sensing is relatively poor due to the poor quality of the training dataset used in the model. This study proposed a smart sensing framework that combined camera-based and environmental sensing approaches using supervised learning to gather standard and robust datasets related to indoor occupancy that can be used for cross-validation of different machine learning algorithms in formal research. The proposed solution is tested in the living room with a prototype system integrated with various sensors using a random forest regressor, although other techniques could be easily integrated within the proposed framework. The primary implication of this study is to predict the room occupation through the use of sensors providing inputs into a model to lower energy consumption. The results indicate that the proposed solution can obtain data, process, and predict occupant presence and number with 99.3% accuracy. Additionally, to demonstrate the impact of occupant number in energy saving, one room with two zones is modeled each zone with air condition with different thermostat controller. The first zone uses IoFClime and the second zone uses modified IoFClime using a design-builder. The simulation is conducted using EnergyPlus software with the random simulation of 10 occupants and local climate data under three scenarios. The Fanger model's thermal comfort analysis shows that up to 50% and 25% energy can be saved under the first and third scenarios."
482,Sustained Ranavirus Outbreak Causes Mass Mortality and Morbidity of Imperiled Amphibians in Florida,"Arik M Hartmann,Max L Maddox,Robert J Ossiboff,Ana V Longo,Arik M Hartmann,Max L Maddox,Robert J Ossiboff,Ana V Longo",A persistent 2-month long outbreak of Ranavirus in a natural community of amphibians contributed to a mass die-off of gopher frog tadpoles (Lithobates capito) and severe disease in striped newts (Notophthalmus perstriatus) in Florida. Ongoing mortality in L. capito and disease signs in N. perstriatus continued for 5 weeks after the first observation. Hemorrhagic disease and necrosis were diagnosed from pathological examination of L. capito tadpoles. We confirmed detection of a frog virus 3 (FV3)-like Ranavirus via quantitative PCR in all species. Our findings highlight the susceptibility of these species to Rv and the need for long-term disease surveillance during epizootics.
483,The assessment of forest ecological security and its determining indicators: A case study of the Yangtze River Economic Belt in China,"Lu, Shasha; Tang, Xu; Guan, Xingliang; Qin, Fan; Liu, Xu; Zhang, Dahong","This study put forward an evaluation index system for measuring forest ecological security index (FESI). Taking the 1086 counties located in the Yangtze River Economic Belt as a case study, we investigated the change and its spatial pattern of FESI, as well as the determining indicators (both natural and socio-economic), with the support of Arcmap and GeoDA software. The average FESI value of the study counties in 2010 and 2015 was found to be 0.4226 and 0.4990, increased by 18.08%. Spatially, an evident spatial gradient change was identified, with FESI values in the upstream areas of the Yangtze River being higher than those in midstream areas, and the values of midstream areas in turn being higher than those in downstream areas. The eight tributary basins within the economic belt witnessed significantly different FESI values. Based on the results of this evaluation of FESI and its sub-evaluation indexes, we identified 46.04% of the total counties as constituting ""problem areas"". These problem areas were mainly concentrated in Shanghai, Jiangsu and Anhui provinces, followed by counties around Dongting Lake, Poyang Lake and in Sichuan province. A regression analysis was conducted in order to identify the determining indicators behind forest ecological security, with results indicating that the ratio of secondary industry, the urbanization rate, the per capita financial institution loan balance, accumulated temperature and wind speed all negatively impacted on FESI values, while population structure, soil organic matter and rainfall were revealed to play a positive role; all of these indicators were highly significant. Given these findings, we also set out a series of policy measures intended to promote the sustainable forest development of the study region. These include the vigorous development of tertiary industry and moves to reduce the proportion of the secondary industry in the national economy, the development of a circular economy, slowing the pace of urbanization, and continued increases in forestry investment in central cities particularly in problem areas."
484,Knee symptoms do not affect walking biomechanics among women 6 months after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction,"Katherine Collins,Ryan Fajardo,Matthew Harkey,Jeffrey Knake,Caroline Lisee,Luke Wilcox,Jamie Tasco,Christopher Kuenze,Katherine Collins,Ryan Fajardo,Matthew Harkey,Jeffrey Knake,Caroline Lisee,Luke Wilcox,Jamie Tasco,Christopher Kuenze","Women with anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction report worse pain and knee-related symptoms, and also exhibit biomechanical changes that may be related to knee osteoarthritis (OA) development. This is particularly concerning as symptom state has been previously associated with knee OA development. The purpose of this study was to compare lower extremity walking biomechanics between women (age: 21.40 ± 8.54 years) experiencing clinically significant knee-related symptoms and women with acceptable symptoms 6 months following surgery. Twenty-eight women with history of primary, unilateral anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction who completed a lower extremity walking biomechanics assessment 6 months following surgery were included in this analysis. Women were dichotomized as experiencing acceptable or clinically significant knee symptoms according to Knee injury and OA Outcomes Score cut-offs described by Englund et al. Walking biomechanics were compared between women with clinically significant and acceptable symptoms using one-way analysis of covariances for involved limb biomechanics. Biomechanical variables of interest were: peak vertical ground reaction forces (vGRFs), vGRF loading rates, knee flexion angles, knee extension moments, knee adduction angles, and knee adduction moments, and gait speed. Nearly 60% of women reported clinically significant knee symptoms 6 months postoperative. There were no statistically significant differences between symptom groups for walking biomechanics and gait speed outcomes. These findings suggest patient reported knee symptoms may not be a primary influence on walking biomechanics 6 months following anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction. Though, longitudinal assessment of changes in symptom state and walking biomechanics may be warranted as poorer walking biomechanics and symptoms are indicators of knee OA."
485,"Driving factors of total carbon emissions from the construction industry in Jiangsu Province, China","Li, Dezhi; Huang, Guanying; Zhang, Guomin; Wang, Jiangbo","Global warming caused by greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions has become a paramount problem for all countries to solve. The construction industry emits 36 percent of the GHG in all sectors globally. China is the largest carbon emitter in the world, and Jiangsu province has been used as a test bed for reforming and developing modern construction industry in China. The aim of the study is to explore the driving factors of the total carbon emissions from the construction industry (CECI) in the provincial region using a hybrid Logarithmic Mean Divisia Index (LMDI) model. The findings of the study indicate that: 1) Indirect and operational CECI account for the largest proportion (52.22% and 46.02% in 2016 respectively); 2) The driving factors of CECI in Jiangsu province are the area factor (contribution from 2005 to 2016 is 100.22%) and the output value intensity factor (86.56%) while the restraining factor is the carbon emission intensity (-80.35%). Discussion and implicated policies, such as improving the energy efficiency of related industries and using green building materials have been elaborated at the end of the study. The decomposition and calculation method presented in this paper provides a useful tool for policymakers to evaluate CECI of a province or state and formulate appropriate carbon policies to reduce emissions and promote low-carbon development in a region.

486,"Status, characterization, and potential utilization of municipal solid waste as renewable energy source: Lahore case study in Pakistan","Azam, Mudassar; Jahromy, Saman Setoodeh; Raza, Waseem; Raza, Nadeem; Lee, Sang Soo; Kim, Ki-Hyun; Winter, Franz","With rapid increases in population and urbanization, uncontrolled municipal solid waste (MSW) is a threat to public health and environmental safety. In this study, we explore its generation, treatment, and characteristics of physical/chemical composition and assess the potential of MSW as a renewable energy source in Lahore, the second largest city in Pakistan. Based on the average generation rate of MSW (i.e., 0.65 kg/capita/day), the daily production of MSW in this city would reach 7150 tons/day. However, its disposal in a safely engineered way has been restricted due to the lack of: (a) pre-planning, (b) infrastructure, (c) political will, and (d) public awareness. Various samples of MSW considering socio-economic structure were collected. The physical components of MSW in Lahore were found to be in the descending order of biodegradable, nylon plastic bags, textile, diaper, and paper. The inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES) technique was used to determine the heavy metal content and leachability of the MSW components to check for the environmental contamination risk. The proximate and ultimate analysis of this MSW was also carried out along with its heating values. The average high heating value of MSW was measured as 14,490 kJ kg(-1). Energy recovery potential of 48MW was assessed further from 2000 tons of MSW/day. The results of this study should be helpful for policy makers to establish a MSW management strategy for the potential renewable energy alternative."

Molecular evidence showed that D.shenzhenensis is allied to D.conjugata, whereas it has morphologically significant differences (P < 0.05) on the basis of quantitative trait statistical analysis. Overall, the morphological evidence, taken together with the result of cpDNA indicated that D.shenzhenensis is a distinct species."
488,Modelling water yield with the InVEST model in a data scarce region of northwest China,"Yang, Xu; Chen, Ruishan; Meadows, Michael E.; Ji, Guangxing; Xu, Jianhua","The Bosten Lake basin is an important arid region of northwest China, and has exhibited a declining trend in both lake area and level of water during recent decades. Reliable information on water yield, an important attribute of available water resources in a region, is vital to assess the potential for socio-economic development. The Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Tradeoffs (InVEST) model is applied here to simulate water yield in the Bosten Lake basin. The spatial and temporal dynamics of water yield, and the response of water yield to land use and precipitation change, are analysed for the period 1985 to 2015. The results show that, overall, water yield increased during 1985-2015, and that the magnitude of change was greater in the eastern part of the region. The water yield capacity, positively correlated with precipitation, is highest under grassland vegetation and lowest in cultivated and unused land. The paper demonstrates that statistical downscaling and climate reanalysis data can be used in the InVEST model to improve the accuracy of simulated water yield in data scarce regions."

Process parameters were optimized using Plackett-Berman and Box-Benhken design. Under the optimized fermentation conditions, high fibrinolytic activity of 403.59 U/mL was obtained. It was purified with a specific activity of 3572.4 U/mg by ammonium sulfate precipitation and SP Sepharose chromatography. The molecular weight of the enzyme was approximately 32 kDa. It exhibited maximum activity at 40 °C and pH 7.4. Its activity was enhanced by Cu2+, Na+, Zn2+, and completely inhibited by phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, soybean trypsin inhibitor, aprotinin, which indicates it could be a serine protease. The enzyme could degrade fibrin clot directly without the need of plasminogen activator, and effectively cleaved Aα, Bβ, γ chains of fibrinogen. It could inhibit the formation of blood clots in vitro and acts as an anticoagulant. Compared to heparin the purified enzyme showed extended anticoagulant activity. Blood clots were dissolved effectively and dissolution rate was increased with time. Based on these results, this novel enzyme has the potential to be developed as a thrombolytic agent."
490,The changing landscape of relapsed and/or refractory multiple myeloma (MM): fundamentals and controversies,"José-Ángel Hernández-Rivas,Rafael Ríos-Tamayo,Cristina Encinas,Rafael Alonso,Juan-José Lahuerta,José-Ángel Hernández-Rivas,Rafael Ríos-Tamayo,Cristina Encinas,Rafael Alonso,Juan-José Lahuerta","The increase in the number of therapeutic alternatives for both newly diagnosed and relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM) patients has widened the clinical scenario, leading to a level of complexity that no algorithm has been able to cover up to date. At present, this complexity increases due to the wide variety of clinical situations found in MM patients before they reach the status of relapsed/refractory disease. These different backgrounds may include primary refractoriness, early relapse after completion of first-line therapy with latest-generation agents, or very late relapse after chemotherapy or autologous transplantation. It is also important to bear in mind that many patient profiles are not fully represented in the main randomized clinical trials (RCT), and this further complicates treatment decision-making. In RRMM patients, the choice of previously unused drugs and the number and duration of previous therapeutic regimens until progression has a greater impact on treatment efficacy than the adverse biological characteristics of MM itself. In addition to proteasome inhibitors, immunomodulatory drugs, anti-CD38 antibodies and corticosteroids, a new generation of drugs such as XPO inhibitors, BCL-2 inhibitors, new alkylators and, above all, immunotherapy based on conjugated anti-BCMA antibodies and CAR-T cells, have been developed to fight RRMM. This comprehensive review addresses the fundamentals and controversies regarding RRMM, and discusses the main aspects of management and treatment. The basis for the clinical management of RRMM (complexity of clinical scenarios, key factors to consider before choosing an appropriate treatment, or when to treat), the arsenal of new drugs with no cross resistance with previously administered standard first line regimens (main phase 3 clinical trials), the future outlook including the usefulness of abandoned resources, together with the controversies surrounding the clinical management of RRMM patients will be reviewed in detail."
491,The impact of energy price on CO2 emissions in China: A spatial econometric analysis,"Li, Kunming; Fang, Liting; He, Lerong","Excessive greenhouse gas emissions pose a global environmental concern. This paper examines the impact of energy price on China's CO2 emissions based on an extended STIRPAT (Stochastic Impacts by Regression on Population, Affluence and Technology) structural human ecology model. We utilize Chinese provincial data from 2002 to 2016 and apply the spatial panel data techniques to explicitly consider spatial correlations and spillover effects between observations. Our results show that energy price has a significant negative impact on China's CO2 emissions after controlling for other economic and energy market factors and spatial correlations of these variables. We identify a significant direct impact of the focal province's price change on CO2 emissions and an indirect effect exerted by energy price changes in adjacent provinces. Such spatial spillover effects are also observed in other determinants identified in the extended STIRPAT model. We also document a path dependent pattern in China's provincial CO2 emissions with last period CO2 emissions influencing the current CO2 emission levels. Our results show that the negative impact of energy price on CO2 emissions remains qualitatively the same after incorporating the influence of previous period CO2 emissions. Our results are also robust to the inclusion of lagged energy price measures, alternative spatial economic models, and alternative spatial weight matrices. Overall, our paper highlights the role of energy market in curbing CO2 emissions and promoting sustainable economic development. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."
492,"Analysis on the carbon emission peaks of China's industrial, building, transport, and agricultural sectors","Chen, Xi; Shuai, Chenyang; Wu, Ya; Zhang, Yu","Carbon emission peak has become a focus of political and academic concern in global community since the launch of Kyoto Protocol. China, as the largest carbon emitter, has committed to reaching the carbon peak by 2030 in Paris Agreement. This ambitious national goal requires the endeavors of individual sectors, particularly those carbon-intensive ones. Predicting the sectoral peaks under current endeavors and understanding driving forces for the carbon emission changes in the past years are substantial for guiding the allocation of the country's future efforts. In the past studies contextualized in China, the prediction of its carbon peaks seldom appeared at the sectoral level, which is considered as a research gap. Therefore, this study predicts the peaks at four carbon pillar sectors (i.e. industrial, building, transport and agricultural sectors) and identifies the driving forces for the carbon emission changes of them. This study hypothesized Carbon Kuznets curve (CKC) as the theoretical model for predicting the peaks and used Logarithmic mean Divisia index (LMDI) as the method to identify the driving forces. The results show that the carbon emission in the country will peak in 2036, six years later than the agreed year. The lateness of the national peak can be attributed to the significant lateness of three pillar sectors' peaks, occurring in 2031 for the industrial sector, 2035 for the building sector, 2043 for the transport sector, peak for the agricultural sector occurs four years earlier in 2026 though. Furthermore, the results show that carbon emission is significantly driven by the booming economic output and inhibited by decreasing energy intensity, but the slight fluctuation of energy structure plays a minor role in the four sectors. Policy adjustments are proposed for effectively and efficiently urging the on-time occurrence of the national peak. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."
493,PCM integrated glass in glass tube solar collector for low and medium temperature applications: Thermodynamic & techno-economic approach,"Chopra, K.; Tyagi, V. V.; Pandey, A. K.; Sharma, Ravi Kumar; Sari, Ahmet","In present work, techno-economic and thermodynamic analysis of an ETC with/without PCM has been undertaken. The results approved that for all selected flow rates, ETC/S obtained higher energy and exergy efficiencies in comparison to the ETC/WS design. The maximum attained value of average daily energy efficiency for ETC/S and ETC/WS was 78.36% and 54.10% respectively with a high flow rate (24 L/h). Also, at this flow rate, ETC/S and ETC/WS attained peak value of average daily exergy efficiency of 23.15% and 20.06% respectively. The average daily energy efficiency of ETC/S was found to be 53.46%, 30.87%, and 44.85% higher in comparison to ETC/WS for low (8 L/h), medium (16 L/h) and high (24 L/h) flow rate respectively. Hence, the integration of SA (stearic acid) as energy storage material with HP-ETC not only stored the thermal energy but also enhanced the system performance. Furthermore, the techno-economic study revealed that the cost of production of hot water by ETC/S has been found to be lowest compared with ETC/WS and electric geyser. This analysis showed that ETC/S system has a promising potential in terms of supply of hot water from low to medium temperature range at a cheaper rate at lower payback period. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

494,Co-Occurrence of Reading and Writing Difficulties: The Application of the Interactive Dynamic Literacy Model,"Young-Suk Grace Kim,Young-Suk Grace Kim","This article presents the application of the interactive dynamic literacy (IDL) model (Kim, 2020b) toward understanding difficulties in learning to read and write. According to the IDL model, reading and writing are part of communicative acts that draw on largely shared processes and skills as well as unique processes and skills. As such, reading and writing are dissociable but interdependent systems that have hierarchical, interactive, and dynamic relations. These key tenets of the IDL model are applied to the disruption of reading and writing development to explain co-occurrence of reading-writing difficulties using a single framework. The following hypotheses are presented: (a) co-occurrence between word reading and spelling and handwriting difficulties; (b) co-occurrence of dyslexia with written composition difficulties; (c) co-occurrence between reading comprehension and written composition difficulties; (d) co-occurrence of language difficulties with reading difficulties and writing difficulties; (e) co-occurrence of reading, writing, and language difficulties with weak domain-general skills or executive functions such as working memory and attentional control (including attention-deficit/ hyperactivity disorder [ADHD]); and (f) multiple pathways for reading and writing difficulties.

Cardiovascular disease in diabetes is multifactorial, and control of the cardiovascular risk factors leads to substantial reductions in cardiovascular events. The 2015 American Heart Association and American Diabetes Association scientific statement, ""Update on Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease in Adults With Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus in Light of Recent Evidence,"" highlighted the importance of modifying various risk factors responsible for cardiovascular disease in diabetes. At the time, there was limited evidence to suggest that glucose-lowering medications reduce the risk of cardiovascular events. At present, several large randomized controlled trials with newer antihyperglycemic agents have been completed, demonstrating cardiovascular safety and reduction in cardiovascular outcomes, including cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, stroke, and heart failure. This AHA scientific statement update focuses on (1) the evidence and clinical utility of newer antihyperglycemic agents in improving glycemic control and reducing cardiovascular events in diabetes; (2) the impact of blood pressure control on cardiovascular events in diabetes; and (3) the role of newer lipid-lowering therapies in comprehensive cardiovascular risk management in adults with diabetes. This scientific statement addresses the continued importance of lifestyle interventions, pharmacological therapy, and surgical interventions to curb the epidemic of obesity and metabolic syndrome, important precursors of prediabetes, diabetes, and comorbid cardiovascular disease. Last, this scientific statement explores the critical importance of the social determinants of health and health equity in the continuum of care in diabetes and cardiovascular disease."
496,Risk management in distributed wind energy implementing Analytic Hierarchy Process,"Zhou, Shan; Yang, Pu","Distributed wind power has received growing attention in recent years. However, high risks remain in its investigation, which severely hindered its development. This study attempts to gather and identify risk factors in distributed wind power through literature reviews and rank the risks based on expert opinions. Based on previous literature, we classified risk for distributed wind power investment into four types, namely the political risks, economic risks, social risks, and technical risks. Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) method is used to assess risks in the life cycle of the distributed wind farm. Political, Economic, Social and Technical methodology as the criteria hierarchy is introduced to classify the identified risks as the sub-criteria hierarchy in the AHP model. The result shows that the risk of changes in electricity price policy is the most critical impact on the distributed wind power system to obtain sustainable development and make profits. Therefore, the government needs to provide a long-term vision of electricity price policy to promote the development of distributed wind projects. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."
497,Optimization of the utilization of deep borehole heat exchangers,"Pan, Sheng; Kong, Yanlong; Chen, Chaofan; Pang, Zhonghe; Wang, Jiyang","Deep-borehole heat exchangers (DBHE) are generally coaxial pipes installed in deep boreholes and has become an alternative approach to utilize geothermal energy. Since the performance of the DBHE system can be affected by several parameters, it is important to optimize the design of parameters for the DBHE. In this paper, based on the analytical method, we carried out the sensitivity analysis of DBHE design parameters, including outer pipe diameter, inner pipe diameter, flow rate, outer pipe materials, grout materials, and borehole depth during continuous operation for 4 months. The sensitivity analysis results indicate that the heat extraction rate can be significantly affected by outer pipe diameter, borehole depth, and flow rate. The effects of grout materials, inner pipe diameter and outer pipe materials are of second-order. Finally, an optimization method based on the lowest Average Energy Cost index was proposed to optimize these DBHE design parameters under different geological conditions. Given the cost in this study, a combination scheme of all the optimal parameters is given for different depth wells under different geological conditions."

Remote sensing has become an important tool for monitoring large scale AIS, while it remains challenging for accurate extraction of AIS using optical datasets alone due to the high diversity of land covers over large scale. Previous studies indicated the complementary use of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) to improve the AIS estimation, while most of them were limited to local and small scales. The potential of SAR for large scale AIS mapping is still uncertain and under-explored. In this study, first, a machine learning framework incorporating both optical and SAR data based on Google Earth Engine platform was developed for mapping and analyzing the annual dynamics of AIS in China. Feature-level fusion for SAR and optical data across large scale was tested applicable considering the backscattering coefficients, texture measures and spectral characteristics. Improved accuracy (averaged 2% increased overall accuracy and averaged 4% increased Kappa coefficient) and better delineation between the bright impervious surface and bare land was observed comparing with using optical data alone. Second, comprehensive assessment was conducted using high-resolution samples from Google Earth, census data from China Statistic Yearbook and benchmark datasets from the GlobeLand30 and GHSL, demonstrating the feasibility and reliability of the proposed method and results. Last but not the least, we analyzed the spatial and temporal patterns of AIS in China from national, regional and provincial levels."

Using the geographical detector model, we quantitative measured 13 cities in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region's social factors and their interaction impacts on PM2.5 concentration in 2016. In the analysis process, factor analysis method is used to separate the factors preliminary. According to the results, the factors mainly divided into two categories, i.e. economic factor and environment factor. R&D ranks top in the studied cities in terms of factor detection results, presenting closely relationship between PM2.5 concentration and R&D. We also find the interaction between any two factors all enhance impact on PM2.5 concentration than any one alone. This study provided a scientific basic and guidance for measure the driving degree of social factors and their interaction effects."
500,"The dynamics of dominance: open questions, challenges and solutions","Eli D Strauss,Daizaburo Shizuka,Eli D Strauss,Daizaburo Shizuka","Although social hierarchies are recognized as dynamic systems, they are typically treated as static entities for practical reasons. Here, we ask what we can learn from a dynamical view of dominance, and provide a research agenda for the next decades. We identify five broad questions at the individual, dyadic and group levels, exploring the causes and consequences of individual changes in rank, the dynamics underlying dyadic dominance relationships, and the origins and impacts of social instability. Although challenges remain, we propose avenues for overcoming them. We suggest distinguishing between different types of social mobility to provide conceptual clarity about hierarchy dynamics at the individual level, and emphasize the need to explore how these dynamic processes produce dominance trajectories over individual lifespans and impact selection on status-seeking behaviour. At the dyadic level, there is scope for deeper exploration of decision-making processes leading to observed interactions, and how stable but malleable relationships emerge from these interactions. Across scales, model systems where rank is manipulable will be extremely useful for testing hypotheses about dominance dynamics. Long-term individual-based studies will also be critical for understanding the impact of rare events, and for interrogating dynamics that unfold over lifetimes and generations. This article is part of the theme issue 'The centennial of the pecking order: current state and future prospects for the study of dominance hierarchies'."

While, appropriate selection of rootstock has significant impact on the quality of peach fruit. Therefore, in the current study the influence of three rootstocks viz. 'GF-677', 'Peshawar Local' and 'Swat Local' were evaluated on the quality of 'Flordaking' peaches following cold storage during two consecutive years. The fruit from these rootstocks were kept at 0 °C for five weeks were studied for various fruit physical (weight loss, colour, firmness) and biochemical (pH, soluble solids content (SSC), titratable acidity (TA), SSC:TA ratio, fruit juice pH, sugars (total, reducing and non-reducing sugars), ascorbic acid (vitamin C) and free radicals scavenging activities) were evaluated. During both years, fruit harvested form trees grafted on 'GF-677' exhibited reduced fruit weight loss, changes in Chroma (C*) and highest fruit firmness, Lightness (L*), ascorbic acid contents and radical scavenging activities as compared to fruit harvested from tree grafted on other rootstocks. In conclusion, the post-harvest quality of scion 'Flordaking' peach fruit was significantly influenced and best quality can be obtained when it is grafted on 'GF-677' rootstock."
502,Effects of urban forms on CO2 emissions in China from a multi-perspective analysis,"Shi, Kaifang; Xu, Tao; Li, Yuanqing; Chen, Zuoqi; Gong, Wenkang; Wu, Jianping; Yu, Bailang","Effectively evaluating the effects of urban forms on CO2 emissions has become a hot topic in socioeconomic sustainable development; however, few studies have been able to explore the urban form-CO2 emission relationships from a multi-perspective view. Here, we attempted to analyze the relationships between urban forms and CO2 emissions in 264 Chinese cities, with explicit consideration of the government policies, urban area size, population size, and economic structure. First, urban forms were calculated using the urban land derived from multiple-source remote sensing data. Second, we collected and processed CO2 emissions and three control variables. Finally, a correlation analysis was implemented to explore whether and to what extent the spatial patterns of urban forms were associated with CO2 emissions. The results show that urban form irregularity had a more significant impact on CO2 emissions in low-carbon pilot cities than in non-pilot cities. The impact of the complexity of urban forms on CO2 emissions was relatively significant in the small- and large-sized cities than in the medium-sized cities. Moreover, urban form complexity had a significant correlation with CO2 emissions in all of the cities, the level of which basically increased with the population size. This study provides scientific bases for use in policy-making to prepare effective policies for developing a low-carbon economy with consideration of the associations between urban forms and CO2 emissions in different scenarios."
503,Static and dynamic cultivated land use efficiency in China: A minimum distance to strong efficient frontier approach,"Han, Haibin; Zhang, Xiaoyu","Cultivated land use efficiency (CLUE) not only affects sustainable economic growth but is also closely related to the physical and mental health of citizens. In this paper, we employed the minimum distance to strong efficient frontier with undesirable outputs (MinDS-U) model and Malmquist productivity index based on the MinDS-U model (MinDS-U-M) to conduct static and dynamic multiperspective analyses of the CLUE in 30 provinces in China from 1997 to 2017 under carbon emission constraints. The study results showed that: (1) There were significant differences in the cultivated land use technical efficiency (CLUTE) between eastern, central, western, and northeastern China. Compared with central China, eastern, western, and northeastern China have higher CLUTE and are closer to the production frontier. (2) There are varying degrees of non-coordination between carbon emission reduction and economic growth during cultivated land use in eastern, central, western, and northeastern China, and the problem of non-environmentally friendly technology is particularly prominent in central China. (3) The inter-provincial cultivated land use total factor productivity (CLUTFP) growth mode was unsatisfactory, and only Shaanxi and Chongqing followed the dual-high growth model.

Beside general risk factors, there are some genetic factors which lead to cardiovascular diseases. Various nuclear DNA mutation and also mitochondrial DNA mutations have been related with cardiovascular diseases. In the present study, a total of 21 samples were collected from different families residing in district Dir. DNA was extracted from buccal epithelial cells using saliva. The mitochondrial tRNA leu (MT TL1) gene was amplified by PCR and 10 samples of different families were sequenced. The sequence was aligned with revised Cambridge Reference Sequence (rCRS) accession # NC-012920.1. It is concluded that cardiovascular diseases in our subjects are not due to mutation in the mitochondrial leucine tRNA gene. However, a large population of subjects with cardiovascular diseases needs to be studied and whole mitochondrial DNA is needed to be sequenced in the subjects with CVD. This will give an idea about the probable DNA marker which can be used to prevent loses due to these diseases at a very early stages."
505,Carbon sequestration potential of forest vegetation in China from 2003 to 2050: Predicting forest vegetation growth based on climate and the environment,"Qiu, Zixuan; Feng, Zhongke; Song, Yanni; Li, Menglu; Zhang, Panpan","Over the past two decades, the burning of fossil fuels in China has been excessive, causing carbon emissions to increase. Surface temperatures and the occurrence of natural disasters have also increased. Considering the important role of forests in reducing emissions, China conducted a series of studies on carbon storage by forest vegetation that involved well-developed estimation methods. However, there are still uncertainties in predicting future changes in forest vegetation acting as a carbon sink. This study used data collected from 7801 national forest inventory (NFI) forest plots in 2003, 2008 and 2013 as well as related forest ecosystem biomass data. The dynamic growth, biomass and carbon storage of arbor, economic and shrubbery forests were studied. This study made a breakthrough in predicting forest biomass and carbon storage based on growth-related changes in forest vegetation in China, improved the accuracy of predicting arbor forest carbon storage and filled a gap in research on the carbon storage/sink properties of economic, shrubbery and bamboo forests. In the results of this study, from 2003 to 2050, the carbon storage, density and carbon sink of forest vegetation in China increased rapidly. Mature forests in China played a major role in the increase in carbon storage, and the quality of young, half-mature and mature forests steadily improved. China's forest carbon storage was mainly concentrated in the southwestern and northeastern regions, between which the southwestern region had the highest carbon density. In addition, carbon storage and density increased faster in the southwestern region than in the northeastern region. The carbon storage and density of forest vegetation were greater in Tibet than in other areas. The carbon storage of forest vegetation in Tibet increased faster than that in other areas, and the carbon density of forest vegetation in Xinjiang increased faster than that in other areas. In addition, the carbon storage and carbon density of forest vegetation in Ningxia increased slower than those in other areas. From 2020 to 2050, China's forest vegetation will absorb 22.14% of CO2 emissions from fossil fuel combustion, which will play an important role in slowing increases in greenhouse gases in the next 30 years.

506,A novel composite silver nanoparticles loaded calcium oxide stemming from egg shell recycling: A potent photocatalytic and antibacterial activities,"Alsohaimi, Ibrahim Hotan; Nassar, Amr Mohamed; Elnasr, Tarek Ahmed Seaf; Cheba, Ben Amar","Industrial wastewater resulted from textile dyeing process is considered as a big environmental problem. Therefore, recycling of wastewater offers environmental and economic values specially if the materials used are resulted from recycling of other kinds of waste. From this point of view and for the first time this work deals with the study the wastewater recycling by calcium oxide resulted from eggshell recycling. Calcium oxide (CaO) nanocrystals were created by the thermal annealing of chicken egg shell at 1100 degrees C for 2 h s. Heat treatment at 200 degrees C in air for 2 h s of the resulted CaO with silver oxalate gave the novel composite, silver nanoparticles loaded calcium oxide (Ag-NPs @ CaO). By applying electronic spectra (UV-Vis), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy with the energy dispersion spectrum analysis (SEM-EDX) and transmittance electronic microscope (TEM), the materials were characterized. The energy band gap was calculated from the equation of Tauc for CaO and Ag-NPs@CaO and measured to be 2.1 and 2 eV, respectively. Indigo carmine (IC) as a model of photocatalytic decolorization was performed using both CaO and Ag@CaO nanoparticles under sunlight exposure. The impacts of various variables such as solution pH, dose quantity, temperature and irradiation time were studied. Both catalysts displayed an effective photocatalytic activity in IC decolorization but Ag@CaO composite displayed a stronger activity than CaO. The percentages of dye degradation were approximate to 99.21% and 99.45% in case of CaO and Ag@CaO, respectively. The antibacterial efficiency was measured against some Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. Ag@CaO provided powerful weapons against the drug-resistant bacteria. These findings give a promising and economic strategy for all those who are interested in industries which involve dyeing process. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."

Data from each modality are frequently analyzed separately using, for instance, dimensionality reduction techniques, which result in a loss of mutual information. We propose a novel regularization method, generalized ridgified Partially Empirical Eigenvectors for Regression (griPEER), to estimate associations between the brain structure features and a scalar outcome within the generalized linear regression framework. griPEER improves the regression coefficient estimation by providing a principled approach to use external information from the structural brain connectivity. Specifically, we incorporate a penalty term, derived from the structural connectivity Laplacian matrix, in the penalized generalized linear regression. In this work, we address both theoretical and computational issues and demonstrate the robustness of our method despite incomplete information about the structural brain connectivity. In addition, we also provide a significance testing procedure for performing inference on the estimated coefficients. Finally, griPEER is evaluated both in extensive simulation studies and using clinical data to classify HIV+ and HIV- individuals."
508,Primary concentration - The critical step in implementing the wastewater based epidemiology for the COVID-19 pandemic: A mini-review,"Lu, Dingnan; Huang, Zhuangrong; Luo, Jiayue; Zhang, Xiaoqi; Sha, Sha","The recent outbreak of a novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has posed a significant global public health threat and caused dramatic social and economic disruptions. A new research direction is attracting a significant amount of attention in the academic community of environmental sciences and engineering, in which rapid community-levelmonitoring could be achieved by applying the methodology of wastewater based epidemiology (WBE). Given the fact that the development of amass balance on the total number of viral RNA copies in wastewater samples and the infected stool specimens is the heart of WBE, the result of the quantitative RNA detection in wastewater has to be highly sensitive, accurate, and reliable. Thus, applying effective concentration methods before the subsequent RNA extraction and RT-qPCR detection is a must-have procedure for the WBE. This review provides new insights into the primary concentration methods that have been adopted by the eighteen recently reported COVID-19 wastewater detection studies, along with a brief discussion of the mechanisms of the most commonly used virus concentration methods, including the PEG-based separation, electrostatically charged membrane filtration, and ultrafiltration. In the end, two easy and well-proven concentration strategies are recommended as below, aiming to maximize the practical significance and operational effectiveness of the SARS-CoV-2 virus concentration from wastewater samples. Strategy1: Prefiltration-Salt addition-Electronegative membrane filtration (for initial volume = 50 mL). Strategy2: Prefiltration-PEG-based separation-Overnight standing (for initial volume from 50 to 1000 mL). (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

This prospective cohort study evaluated whether cardiovascular diseases and metabolic risk factors alter the rate or type of phenoconversion from idiopathic/isolated REM sleep behavior disorder (iRBD) to parkinsonism or dementia. Polysomnography-confirmed iRBD patients recruited between 2004 and 2020 were followed annually. Baseline history of cardiovascular disorders, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and diabetes were compared among patients who developed outcomes versus those who remained outcome-free. No atherosclerotic risk factors were associated with development of α-synucleinopathies. Patients with hypercholesterolemia were somewhat more likely to develop dementia with Lewy bodies rather than Parkinson's disease."
510,Techno-economic analysis of combining forward osmosis-reverse osmosis and anaerobic membrane bioreactor technologies for municipal wastewater treatment and water production,"Vinardell, Sergi; Astals, Sergi; Mata-Alvarez, Joan; Dosta, Joan","The economic feasibility of combining forward osmosis (FO), reverse osmosis (RO) and anaerobic membrane bioreactor (AnMBR) technologies for municipal wastewater treatment with energy and water production was analysed. FO was used to pre-concentrate the AnMBR influent, RO for draw solution regeneration and water production, and AnMBR for wastewater treatment and energy production. The minimum wastewater treatment cost was estimated at 0.81 (sic) m(-3), achieved when limiting the FO recovery to 50% in a closed-loop scheme. However, the cost increased to 1.01 and 1.27 (sic) m(-3) for FO recoveries of 80% and 90%, respectively. The fresh water production cost was estimated at 0.80 and 1.16 (sic) m(-3) for an open-loop scheme maximising water production and a closed-loop scheme, respectively. The low FO membrane fluxes were identified as a limiting factor and a sensitivity analysis revealed that FO membrane fluxes of 10 LMH would significantly improve the competitiveness of FO-RO + AnMBR technology."
511,"How agriculture, manufacture, and urbanization induced carbon emission? The case of Indonesia","Prastiyo, Slamet Eko; Irham; Hardyastuti, Suhatmini; Jamhari","The agriculture and manufacturing sectors are the backbones of the Indonesian economy; for this reason, research on the effects of these sectors on carbon emissions is an important subject. This work adds urbanization to enrich research on the Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) in Indonesia. The results of this study indicate that the EKC hypothesis was confirmed in Indonesia with a turning point of 2057.89 USD/capita. The research results show that all variables affect the escalation of greenhouse gas emissions in Indonesia. Furthermore, there is a bidirectional causality relationship between emissions with economic growth, emissions with agricultural sector, emissions with manufacturing sector, economic growth with agricultural sector, and economic growth with manufacturing. The unidirectional causality is found in emissions by urbanization and economic growth by urbanization. To reduce the impact of environmental damage caused by the activities of agriculture, manufacturing, and urbanization sectors, it is recommended that the government conduct water-efficient rice cultivation and increase the use of renewable energy."

However, this structure stability imparts its low thermal conductivity that leads to buildup of heat at toolworkpiece interface during machining which subsequently has a damaging effect on the tool cutting edge. Several biodegradable cutting fluids have already been attempted controlling the heat generation, environmental footprints to improve the overall machinability. In this endeavor, the effectiveness of dry, liquid nitrogen (LN2) and hybrid cryogenic and minimum quantity lubrication (LN2 + MQL) conditions was evaluated in terms of important machinability indicators for instance surface roughness, cutting forces and temperature. The environmental parameters such as total cycle time, productivity, economic analysis, energy consumption and carbon emissions were also analyzed under these cooling conditions. Lastly, the sustainability assessment of process parameters was calculated with the help of the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) coupled with the Technique for Order Preference Based on Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) techniques. Findings have exhibited superior cooling/lubrication effect under LN2 + MQL conditions lowering the machining as well as environmental indices. The improvement in cycle time and productivity of LN2 and LN2 + MQL was appeared to be 29.01% and 34.21% as compared with dry turning. The sustainability assessment results also revealed that the lower cutting parameters under LN2 + MQL produced best results to achieve the overall sustainability index. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

513,Air Quality during COVID-19 in Four Megacities: Lessons and Challenges for Public Health,"Connerton, Patrick; de Assuncao, Joao Vicente; de Miranda, Regina Maura; Slovic, Anne Dorothee; Perez-Martinez, Pedro Jose; Ribeiro, Helena","The study described in this manuscript analyzed the effects of quarantine and social distancing policies implemented due to the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic on air pollution levels in four western megacities: Sao Paulo in Brazil; Paris in France; and Los Angeles and New York in the United States. The study investigated the levels of four air pollutants-Carbon monoxide (CO), Ozone (O-3), Fine Particulate (PM2.5) and Nitrogen dioxide (NO2)-during the month of March 2020, compared to 2015-2019, in the urban air of these metropolitan areas, controlling for meteorological variables. Results indicated reductions in the levels of PM2.5, CO and NO2, with reductions of the latter two showing statistical significance. In contrast, tropospheric ozone levels increased, except in Los Angeles. The beneficial health effects of cleaner air might also help prevent deaths caused by the epidemic of COVID-19 in megacities by diminishing pressure on hospitals and health equipment. Future actions for the re-starting of non-essential economic activities in these cities should take into consideration the overall importance of health for the individual, as well as for societies."
514,China's pilot emissions trading schemes and competitiveness: An empirical analysis of the provincial industrial sub-sectors,"Zhang, Haijun; Duan, Maosheng","China's economic development has entered a ""new normal"" stage where economic growth has slowed down. In this context, China's local authorities and industry circles are particularly concerned about the impact of emissions trading scheme (ETS), China's first major market-based approach to control greenhouse gas emissions, on competitiveness. This paper contributes to the thin empirical studies on this issue from the perspective of China's provincial industrial sub-sectors. We divide the industry of each province into 37 sub-sectors and screen the actual industrial sub-sector coverage of China's pilot ETSs. Taking advantage of the rich information of sub-sector characteristics and the longitudinal structure of our dataset over 2005-2015, we use a combination of propensity score matching technique and difference-in-difference models to analyze the impact of China's pilot ETSs on gross industrial output value (GIOV) and employment. Empirical results indicate that China's pilot ETSs have exerted a negative impact on the GIOV, and production cut is still the major approach to achieve carbon emission reductions. We also find China's pilot ETSs have led to a significant decrease in employment of the covered industrial sub-sectors. Several robustness checks confirm our findings. Further, our discussions suggest that in the short term, China's pilot ETSs have not promoted the ""decoupling"" of carbon emissions and economic outputs in industrial sub-sectors. While achieving carbon emission reductions, the pilot ETSs have failed to avoid a negative impact on competitiveness. Lastly, we suggest that competent authorities should prudently tailor the quota allocation methods according to sectorial conditions and consider setting up compensation measures, and covered enterprises should incorporate low-carbon development concept and address the challenges proactively from the long run."
515,"Effect of land-use change and optimization on the ecosystem service values of Jiangsu province, China","Wu, Changyan; Chen, Bowen; Huang, Xianjin; Wei, Y. H. Dennis","Rapid urbanization intensifies land-use transition by shrinking cropland and increasing the land development of land in China, which affects the ecosystem services value (ESV) and causes environmental degradation. To improve the quality of the ecological environment, China has launched a strategy for the construction of an ecological civilization and attempted to build an ecological compensation mechanism. In this study, combining linear optimization model with the conversion of land use and its effects at small regional extent (CLUE-S) model to optimize and quantitatively to simulate land-use change based on embedding to maximize the ESV for land use planning in 2025 in Jiangsu province, a Chinese province that has experienced the greatest land-use transition and ESV loss in China. The results showed that a total loss of 5.76 x 10(10) yuan.yr(-1) ESV from 2000 to 2015 was due to the conversion of a total of 17.76% of the land in Jiangsu. However, we predicted that the total area of land use will increase by 0.4% in 2025 compared to that in 2015, which will lead to an increase of the ESV by 3.79 x 10(10) yuan.yr(-1). Cropland and grassland will decrease the most, while woodland, water area and wetland will increase. Moreover, our spatial simulation showed that the regions around the Taihu Lake, the boundary between central and northern Jiangsu, and the inland region of northern Jiangsu will experience great ESV change caused by land-use transition in 2025. We also discussed land use and ecological protection policies. Our simulation results provide a potentially effective guide for implementing ecological compensation mechanisms among sub-regions in Jiangsu province."
516,Inflammation and the Link to Vascular Brain Health: Timing Is Brain,"Katherine T Mun,Jason D Hinman,Katherine T Mun,Jason D Hinman","Inflammation and its myriad pathways are now recognized to play both causal and consequential roles in vascular brain health. From acting as a trigger for vascular brain injury, as evidenced by the COVID-19 pandemic, to steadily increasing the risk for chronic cerebrovascular disease, distinct inflammatory cascades play differential roles in varying states of cerebrovascular injury. New evidence is regularly emerging that characterizes the role of specific inflammatory pathways in these varying states including those at risk for stroke and chronic cerebrovascular injury as well as during the acute, subacute, and repair phases of stroke. Here, we aim to highlight recent basic science and clinical evidence for many distinct inflammatory cascades active in these varying states of cerebrovascular injury. The role of cerebrovascular infections, spotlighted by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 pandemic, and its association with increased stroke risk is also reviewed. Rather than converging on a shared mechanism, these emerging studies implicate varied and distinct inflammatory processes in vascular brain injury and repair. Recognition of the phasic nature of inflammatory cascades on varying states of cerebrovascular disease is likely essential to the development and implementation of an anti-inflammatory strategy in the prevention, treatment, and repair of vascular brain injury. Although advances in revascularization have taught us that time is brain, targeting inflammation for the treatment of cerebrovascular disease will undoubtedly show us that timing is brain."
517,Experimental evaluation on fiber distribution characteristics and mechanical properties of calcium carbonate whisker modified hybrid fibers reinforced cementitious composites,"Xie, Chaopeng; Cao, Mingli; Si, Wen; Khan, Mehran","Calcium carbonate whisker (CW) is used to modify the steel-PVA hybrid fibers reinforced cementitious composites (SPFRCC). The addition of CW result in excellent mechanical properties and considerable economic benefit owing to its microscopic reinforcement effect and low cost. In this study, the flexural behavior, fiber distribution characteristics and compression response of CW modified steel-PVA hybrid fibers reinforced cementitious composites (CW-SPFRCC) are investigated by three-point bending test, image processing technique and uniaxial compression test, respectively. The results indicate that the addition of CW can effectively improve the flexural properties of SPFRCC because of the crack resistance and filling effect at microscale. The best fiber distribution characteristics are observed in CW10-S15P05 due to the presence of CW that modify the adhesion and flowability of cement matrix. The uniaxial compression strength, peak strain, elastic modulus and Poisson's ratio of CW-SPFRCC are increased by 37.1%, 40.2%, 3.7% and 30.7%, respectively. Meanwhile, the uniaxial compression constitutive model is proposed to describe the compression stress-strain relationship of CW-SPFRCC based on the experimental results. Moreover, the microstructure analysis demonstrates that the modification mechanism of CW in SPFRCC is attributed to the interface improvement, CW pull-out, CW slippage, and CW rupture.

For each analyte, two surrogate peptides are quantified after tryptic digestion of the entire plasma protein content: one from a stable part of the molecule, representing the total concentration, and one containing the deamidation-sensitive asparagine, corresponding to the remaining non-deamidated concentration. Using a plasma volume of 10 µL and a 2-h digestion at pH 7, concentrations between 2 and 1000 µg/mL can be determined for the various protein forms with values for bias and CV below 15% and without unacceptable in vitro deamidation taking place. A considerable difference between the total and non-deamidated concentrations, and thus a substantial degree of deamidation, was observed in plasma for both trastuzumab and pertuzumab. After a 56-day forced deamidation test 40% of trastuzumab and 68% of pertuzumab was deamidated, while trastuzumab and pertuzumab showed up to 47% and 35% of deamidation, respectively, in samples collected from breast cancer patients during treatment with a combination of both drugs. A good correlation between the non-deamidated concentration results and those of a receptor binding assay indicate a loss of receptor binding for both trastuzumab and pertuzumab along with the deamidation in their CDRs. Deamidated trastuzumab also lost its capability to inhibit the growth of breast cancer cells in a cell-based viability assay, suggesting a relation between the degree of deamidation and pharmacological activity."
519,Effects of Eco-Innovation on Economic and Environmental Performance: Evidence from Turkey's Manufacturing Companies,"Yurdakul, Melek; Kazan, Halim","The concept of eco-innovation has begun to be considered as a solution to preventing environmental damage, especially since the 1990s. Eco-innovation is expected to reduce amounts of waste, air pollution, and material resource usage. However, the effect of eco-innovation on environmental and financial performance has received limited attention. This paper seeks to fill this gap by studying the effect of eco-innovation on environmental and financial performance. In order to do so, data were obtained by collecting surveys completed by 219 manufacturing companies in Turkey. By using structural equation modeling, we found that eco-innovation has a direct effect on pollution prevention, resource saving and recycling; furthermore, it has an indirect positive effect on cost reduction and thus on economic performance. The findings suggest that decision-makers should adopt eco-innovation due to its cost advantage and pollution prevention potential."
520,Effect of using mineral admixtures and ceramic wastes as coarse aggregates on properties of ultrahigh-performance concrete,"Amin, Mohamed; Tayeh, Bassam A.; Agwa, Ibrahim Saad","Recent advancements in recycling have transformed nonrenewable resources into partially renewable resources. In line with these advancements, the application of wastes, including ceramics, as substitute aggregate materials for construction has elicited considerable research interest. Ceramic waste aggregates can be used to address complex problems, such as the shortage of materials in construction sites, and reduce environmental wastes. This study aims to investigate the effectiveness of replacing silica fume (SF) and metakaolin (MK) with cement to improve ultrahigh-performance concrete (UHPC) prepared using ceramic wastes as coarse aggregates. Eleven UHPC mixes with 10%, 20% and 30% proportions of either SF or MK were designed. The fresh, physical, mechanical and microstructure properties of these mixes were evaluated, and test results showed that replacing cement with either SF or MK can improve the mechanical and physical properties of UHPC. The use of this waste as construction material will yield substantial technical, economic and environmental benefits, particularly from the perspective of sustainable development. The results showed that replacing SF or MK is effective in improving the strength of UHPC, particularly when the SiO2/CaO ratio was increased to 2.98.

Four different percentages of dietary leaf extract powder of Aleo vera (ALE) with a basal feed, designated as, i.e., T0 (Control group; without ALE), T1 (1% ALE), T2 (2% ALE), and T3 (3% ALE). Fish fry was reared in concrete tanks (7.0 m, 1.6 m, 1.0: L, W, H; water volume 11.2 m3/tank), with an average initial weight 4.04 ± 0.03 g/ fry, and each treatment was triplicated. Fry was randomly distributed at a stocking rate of 450 individuals/ tanks. The water quality parameters revealed that temperature, pH, salinity, dissolved oxygen (DO) and nitrates were found in a promising range as given by FAO/WHO limits. However, the record values obtained for Electric Conductivity (EC), Total dissolved solids (TDS), and alkalinities were not found in all tanks' suitable range according to FAO/WHO limits. The results revealed a significant impact of different percentages of dietary ALE supplementation on fry's body composition and haematological parameters. Moreover, the final body weight, final body length, average daily weight gain (g), net weight gain (g) and specific growth rate (%) were significantly higher (p < 0.05) in T1 and T2 compared with T0 and T3 treatments. The poorest feed conversion ratio was recorded in the T2 group compared with other treatments. Thus, the current study provides information about the nutritional quality of Nile tilapia culturing in Pakistan."

On the other hand, the pressure shortage in the natural gas network and increasing heat loss in the district heating network by growth of gas and heat load in winter might play a significant role in the participation of combined heat and power units in the energy markets and operation cost of the whole integrated energy system. Hence, this paper presents a multi-network constrained unit commitment problem in the presence of multi-carrier energy storage technologies aiming to minimize the operation cost of an integrated electricity, gas and district heating system while satisfying the constraints of all three networks. In addition, an information gap decision theory is developed for studying the uncertainty of energy sources under risk-seeker and risk-averse strategies with no need for probability distribution function. Moreover, the role of multi-carrier energy storage technologies in integrated networks is investigated, which indicates decrement of total operation cost and reduction of the effect of wind power uncertainty on total operation cost in presence of the storage technologies."

This concentration is approximately 1000 times that of normal cells, making GSH a specific tumor marker. Overexpression of GSH is critical for mapping the redox state of cancer cells. However, there are few probes and detection methods responsive to GSH that can quantitatively visualize GSH in vivo in two-photon excitation fluorescence (TPEF) imaging mode. The experimental results show that TPEF-GSH could not only target GSH in tumors, but also establish the quantitative relationship between TPEF signal and GSH concentration. We explored the optimal two-photon excitation wavelength of TPEF-GSH, the optimal cell incubation duration with TPEF-GSH, the best imaging time point for GSH in cells, and the quantitative relationship between the TPEF signal and the changes in GSH concentrations. In zebrafish embryo and zebrafish experiments, the ratiometric value of TPEF-GSH increased with the decrease of GSH concentration. Microinjection and co-incubation were used to verify whether the ratiometric value could quantify endogenous GSH in tumor-bearing zebrafish, and the obtained GSH levels were 4.66 mM and 5.16 mM, respectively. The ratio TPEF probe could accurately visualize and quantify GSH in vivo, reflecting the redox status of the tumor. The design of the ratiometric molecular probe provides a reliable strategy for the development of TPEF nanoprobe in vivo. In this article, a new GSH sensitive molecular probe, TPEF-GSH, has been developed with good specificity and sensitivity. TPEF-GSH was successfully used to image cancer cells in vitro and tumor-bearing zebrafish in vivo, and to further detect GSH levels."

By employing time delay τ as the main critical value of the Hopf bifurcation, we investigate the direction of the Hopf bifurcation of such a random network nutrient-microorganism model. Noticing that the results of the direction of the Hopf bifurcation in a random network model are rare, we thus try to use the method of multiple time scales (MTS) to derive amplitude equation and determine the direction of the Hopf bifurcation. It is showed that the delayed random network nutrient-microorganism model can exhibit a supercritical or subcritical Hopf bifurcation. Numerical experiments are performed to verify the validity of the theoretical analysis."

527,"Renewable energy, economic development, and ecological footprint nexus: fresh evidence of renewable energy environment Kuznets curve (RKC) from income groups","Naqvi, Syed Asif Ali; Shah, Syed Ale Raza; Anwar, Sofia; Raza, Hassan","This study aims to measure the association of real economic growth per capita, renewable energy consumption, and financial development with ecological footprints (EFP) across the 155 countries of four different income groups over the period of 1990-2017. For the analysis, the unit root tests allowing cross-sectional dependency, Westerlund cointegration test, common correlated effect of mean group, augmented mean group, mean group, and Dumitrescu-Hurlin panel causality test are used. The results verify both the environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) and renewable energy environment Kuznets curve (RKC) hypotheses in the high-income group; however, other groups have not shown reliable results. Moreover, it is observed that the existence of RKC is a turning point for high-income countries, and it takes place before the turning point of the forthcoming EKC. Besides, empirical outcomes endorse the presence of long-run equilibrium and indicate that financial development has a negative and significant effect on the EFP in the case of the high-income group. In contrast, upper-middle- and lower-middle-income groups show the insignificant relationship with the dependent variable. Likewise, financial development has a positive and significant association with EFP for the low-income group. Conversely, biomass energy has a negative relationship with EFP in high- and lower-middle-income groups, while a positive association has been observed for the remaining two groups. We suppose that the study outcomes would guide the policymakers in decision-making regarding the development and usage of renewable energy to prevent environmental damages."
528,Stochastic optimal sizing of distributed energy resources for a cost-effective and resilient Microgrid,"Wu, Di; Ma, Xu; Huang, Sen; Fu, Tao; Balducci, Patrick","Recent developments and advances in distributed energy resources (DERs) make them more affordable, accessible, and prevalent in microgrids. Research on designing and operating a microgrid with various DERs has received increasing attention during the past few years. This paper proposes a two-stage stochastic mixed-integer programming method for jointly determining optimal sizes of various DERs, considering both economic benefits and resilience performance. The proposed method explicitly models the interaction between DER sizing at the planning stage and hourly or sub-hourly microgrid dispatch at the operating stage in both grid-connected and island modes, considering stochastic grid disturbances, load, and renewable generation. A formulation method is then proposed to convert the stochastic sizing problem to an equivalent mix-integer linear programming problem, which can be efficiently solved even with a large number of system operating conditions. Using the proposed stochastic sizing method, a resource planning analysis for a military base in the U.S. is presented. It is found that the proposed method can effectively determine the optimal DER sizes to meet a required resilience goal at the maximum net-benefit. Impacts of several key factors including tariff rates, discount rate, and survivability level on optimal DER sizes are analyzed through case studies. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."
529,Cost benefits of optimizing hydrogen storage and methanation capacities for Power-to-Gas plants in dynamic operation,"Gorre, Jachin; Ruoss, Fabian; Karjunen, Hannu; Schaffert, Johannes; Tynjala, Tero","Power-to-Gas technologies offer a promising approach for converting renewable electricity into a molecular form (fuel) to serve the energy demands of non-electric energy applications in all end-use sectors. The technologies have been broadly developed and are at the edge of a mass roll-out. The barriers that Power-to-Gas faces are no longer technical, but are, foremost, regulatory, and economic. This study focuses on a Power-to-Gas pathway, where electricity is first converted in a water electrolyzer into hydrogen, which is then synthetized with carbon dioxide to produce synthetic natural gas. A key aspect of this pathway is that an intermittent electricity supply could be used, which could reduce the amount of electricity curtailment from renewable energy generation. Interim storages would then be necessary to decouple the synthesized part from hydrogen production, to enable (I) longer continuous operation cycles for the methanation reactor, and (II) increased annual full-load hours, leading to an overall reduction in gas production costs. This work optimizes a Power-to-Gas plant configuration with respect to the cost benefits using a Monte Carlo-based simulation tool. The results indicate potential cost reductions of up to 17% in synthetic natural gas production by implementing well-balanced components and interim storages. This study also evaluates three different power sources which differ greatly in their optimal system configuration. Results from time-resolved simulations and sensitivity analyses for different plant designs and electricity sources are discussed with respect to technical and economic implications, so as to facilitate a plant design process for decision makers."
530,"Modeling heterogeneous dynamic interactions among energy investment, SO2 emissions and economic performance in regional China","Ahmad, Munir; Zhao, Zhen-Yu; Irfan, Muhammad; Mukeshimana, Marie Claire; Rehman, Abdul; Jabeen, Gul; Li, Heng","Massive investments in energy industry may either promote or mitigate the air pollution which is likely to influence the economic performance. In light of this, the current work is an empirical examination of heterogeneous dynamic causal interactions among energy investment, sulphur dioxide (SO2) emissions and economic growth in regional China. A modified STIRPAT model is developed to introduce energy investment as a determinant of technology. Based on a modified model, a simultaneous equations system has been established to examine the three-way causal interactions among the variables of interest. As a first step, an error-correction-based second generation Westerlund (Oxford Bulletin of Economics and Statistics 69: 0305-9049, (2007). cointegration has been employed and found the long-run relationship. The simultaneous equations have been estimated by employing second generation dynamic common correlated effects mean group estimator (DCCEMGE) for 30 Chinese provinces and cities from 2001 to 2017. The empirical analysis has revealed that the energy investment induces emissions promotion effect while economic growth introduces emissions curtailment effect. However, the emissions curtailment effect remained slightly stronger than emissions promotion effect both at country and regional levels. Further, the energy investment growth uncovered economic performance enhancement effect. Furthermore, the SO2 emissions growth induced economic performance deterioration effect. In this regard, the economic performance deterioration effect exceeded the economic performance enhancement effect. Besides, there is a bidirectional causality operative between SO2 emissions and gross regional product (GRP) growth for the country as well as regional samples. On the contrary, a positive bilateral causal relationship between energy investment and GRP growth is found for the country as well as regional samples. Similarly, it has been found that there exists a positive bilateral causal association between SO2 emissions and energy investment."

E.; Abdelgaied, Mohamed","This study aims to enhance the performance of pyramid-shaped solar stills using a high thermal conductivity absorber plate (graphite) and cooling the glass cover. To achieve this aim experimentally, the absorbent surface manufacture from a graphite material with a thickness of 25 mm. The graphite is characterized by the high thermal conductivity, as well as, the graphite represents a sensible store medium where the thermal energy is stored during the period of the high value of solar radiation and is reclaimed back into the basin water during the period of lower solar radiation intensity and after sunset. Also, the outside surface of the glass cover is cooled to increase the rate of water vapor condensation and then improve the distillate water production. A traditional pyramid-shaped still and a pyramid-shaped still using a high thermal conductivity absorber plate and cooling the glass cover (modified pyramid-shaped still) have been constructed and tested in Tanta University-Egypt, to get the effect of using graphite as an absorber surface and cooling the glass cover on the performance of pyramid-shaped still. The experimental results show that daily production of both modified pyramid-shaped still and a traditional pyramid-shaped still ranges from 9 to 9.19 and 4.37-4.43 l/m(2) day, respectively at the same ambient conditions. The improvement in the daily production of the modified pyramid-shaped still ranges between 105.9 and 107.7% as compared to a traditional pyramid-shaped still. Also, use the graphite with cooling the glass cover improves the everyday efficiency of the modified pyramid-shaped still by 97.2-98.9% as compared to a traditional pyramid-shaped still. The economic analysis presented that use the graphite and cooling the glass cover reduce the cost of distillate water produced from the pyramid-shaped solar still by 13.6%. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Modern approaches for measuring dominance have emerged in recent years taking advantage of increased computational power. One such technique, named Percolation and Conductance (Perc), uses both direct and indirect information about the flow of dominance relationships to generate hierarchical rank order that makes no assumptions about the linearity of these relationships. It also provides a new metric, known as 'dominance certainty', which is a complimentary measure to dominance rank that assesses the degree of ambiguity of rank relationships at the individual, dyadic and group levels. In this focused review, we will (i) describe how Perc measures dominance rank while accounting for both nonlinear hierarchical structure as well as sparsity in data-here we also provide a metric of dominance certainty estimated by Perc, which can be used to compliment the information dominance rank supplies; (ii) summarize a series of studies by our research team reflecting the importance of 'dominance certainty' on individual and societal health in large captive rhesus macaque breeding groups; and (iii) provide some concluding remarks and suggestions for future directions for dominance hierarchy research.

534,A favorable path to domain separation in the orange carotenoid protein,"Mahmoud Sharawy,Natalia B Pigni,Eric R May,José A Gascón,Mahmoud Sharawy,Natalia B Pigni,Eric R May,José A Gascón","The orange carotenoid protein (OCP) is responsible for nonphotochemical quenching (NPQ) in cyanobacteria, a defense mechanism against potentially damaging effects of excess light conditions. This soluble two-domain protein undergoes profound conformational changes upon photoactivation, involving translocation of the ketocarotenoid inside the cavity followed by domain separation. Domain separation is a critical step in the photocycle of OCP because it exposes the N-terminal domain (NTD) to perform quenching of the phycobilisomes. Many details regarding the mechanism and energetics of OCP domain separation remain unknown. In this work, we apply metadynamics to elucidate the protein rearrangements that lead to the active, domain-separated, form of OCP. We find that translocation of the ketocarotenoid canthaxanthin has a profound effect on the energetic landscape and that domain separation only becomes favorable following translocation. We further explore, characterize, and validate the free energy surface (FES) using equilibrium simulations initiated from different states on the FES. Through pathway optimization methods, we characterize the most probable path to domain separation and reveal the barriers along that pathway. We find that the free energy barriers are relatively small (<5 kcal/mol), but the overall estimated kinetic rate is consistent with experimental measurements (>1 ms). Overall, our results provide detailed information on the requirement for canthaxanthin translocation to precede domain separation and an energetically feasible pathway to dissociation."

The investigation here was to determine heterosis effects using different genetic methods: heterosis over better, mid parents, the genetic advance, and genotype, phenotypic coefficient of variation for estimation some traits among six wheat landraces and their F1 hybrids. In 2019, these landraces were sown using hand and after 100 days, the emasculation and crossing were made among these six landraces using hand emasculation of anthers. In 2020, seeds for these genotypes (six wheat landraces and their F1) were sown under normal irrigation accordingly done in 2019. The results showed that the most important parent was Mabia resulted with the highest value in number of tiller/ plant, 1,000-grain weight, and fresh shoot weight. The highest value of plant height among six parents was Naqra while highest value at the same trait among F1 hybrids was P3 XP6. The estimations of heterosis showed that out of 15 crosses, one cross (P1XP5) was significantly better yield than all crosses for these four traits. The genotype coefficient of variation (GCV) ranged from 12.5% to 8.7% while phenotypic coefficient of variation ranged from 17.7% to 11.3%. The correlation coefficients was found between fresh shoot weight and number of tiller and plant height and umber of tiller. Wild wheat still serve as a source of useful germplasm with proven adaption and productivity and thus assembles of the wild wheat assortments are the initial step of breeding program."

S.; Kalia, Vipin Chandra; Lee, Jung-Kul","Immobilization of industrially important enzymes on supports is important to decrease the cost of the overall enzymatic production procedure. Herein, a novel method for synthesizing a new support, magnetic rice straw (MRS) in one step is reported: rice straw (RS) was soaked with Fe2+ ions and these were further reduced to form embedded Fe2O3 nanoparticles on the RS surface, forming MRS. This material presented a magnetic saturation value of 27.32 emu g(-1). Lipase immobilization on MRS resulted in 94.3% immobilization efficiency and 91.3 mg g(-1) of enzyme loading, which are higher than immobilization on native RS. The lipase stability was increased approximately 8-fold at 70 degrees C. The lipase-MRS composite was tested in the esterification reaction of biodiesel production, where it showed prominent reusability. Therefore, this novel and rapid synthesis method can provide ecological and economic support for enzyme immobilization and industrially important product formation."
537,Assessment of COVID-19 Waste Flows During the Emergency State in Romania and Related Public Health and Environmental Concerns,"Mihai, Florin-Constantin","This paper provides a rapid assessment method of potentially infectious waste flow related to the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic in Romania focusing on the emergency state (from 16 March to 14 May 2020) where a national lockdown was in force with restrictive and social distancing measures concerning population mobility and economic activities. Medical and municipal waste management systems are critical services in combating the virus spread in the community. This assessment is useful due to poor available data of medical waste flow in environmental reports and it covers COVID-19 patients, quarantined, and self-isolated persons as the main potential infectious waste sources. The proposed model estimates that COVID-19 related waste flow is 4312 t at the national level from 25 February to 15 June of which 2633 t in the emergency state period. This assessment is correlated with deficiencies of medical and municipal waste management systems in Romania before the COVID-19 pandemic as stress factors of public health and environment. This study points out the main challenges of waste operators and reveals some best practices during this pandemic crisis. Based on the results and discussion section, several recommendations are proposed to COVID-19 waste-related issues and points out the crucial role of the reliable medical and municipal waste database in managing such biologic hazards at national and EU levels. Monitoring of COVID-19 waste flow through such models are important for decision-makers, particularly in low and middle-income countries which are facing waste management deficiencies and gaps in waste statistics, to reduce other contamination risks or related environmental threats."

Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase-1 (IDO-1) is an INF-γ-induced immunomodulating enzyme that has been linked to the cancer cell invasiveness. Because IDO1 is variable among the tumors, we analyzed its expression in the BC invasion using BC mice models and cell culture. MB49 cells were orthotopically or ectopically inoculated in C57Bl6 mice to evaluate IDO1 by immunohistochemistry. For in vitro experiments, expression of IDO1 and INF-γ was evaluated in grade-1 (RT4) and in grade-3 (T24) BC cell lines. Invading and non-invading T24 cells were separated using the Matrigel/Transwell system, of which total RNA was extracted immediately or after 2 weeks of subculture. Finally, IDO1 was silenced in T24 cells to verify its role on cell invasiveness. In both animal models, IDO1 was differentially expressed between non-invading and invading cells. In cell culture, T24 cells expressed more IDO1 than RT4 cells, independently of the INF-γ expression. IDO1 was differentially expressed between non-invading and invading T24 cells, a difference that was lost by long-time subculture. IDO1 silencing resulted in diminished cell invasiveness. In conclusion, IDO1 expression is changed during bladder carcinoma invasion, playing an important role in this process."
540,Simultaneous Ammonium oxidation denitrifying (SAD) in an innovative three-stage process for energy-efficient mature landfill leachate treatment with external sludge reduction,"Zhang, Fangzhai; Li, Xiyao; Wang, Zhong; Jiang, Hao; Ren, Shang; Peng, Yongzhen","High-loaded ammonia and low-strength organics mature landfill leachate is not effectively treated by conventional biological processes. Herein, an innovative solution was proposed using a three-stage Simultaneous Ammonium oxidation Denitrifying (SAD) process. Firstly, ammonia (1760 +/- 126 mg N/L) in wastewater was oxidized to nitrite in a partial nitrification sequencing batch reactor (PN-SBR). Next, 93% PN-SBR effluent and concentrated external waste activated sludge (WAS; MISS = 23057 +/- 6014 mg/L) were introduced to an anoxic reactor for integrated fermentation and denitrification (IFD-SBR). Finally, ammonia (101.4 +/- 13.8 mg N/L) released by fermentation in the IFD-SBR and residual 7% nitrite in the PNSBR were removed through the anaerobic ammonium oxidation (anammox) process in the SAD up-flow anaerobic sludge bed (SAD-UASB). In addition, NO3--N generation during the anammox process could be reduced to nitrite by partial denitrification (PD) and reused as substrate for anammox. A satisfactory total nitrogen (TN) removal efficiency (98.3%), external sludge reduction rate (2.5 kg/m(3) d) and effluent TN concentration (16.7 mg/L) were achieved after long-term operation (280 days). The IFD-SBR and SADUASB contributed to 81.9% and 123% nitrogen removal, respectively. Microbial analysis showed that anammox bacteria (1.5% Candidatus Brocadia) cooperated well with partial denitrifying bacteria (4.3% Thauera) in SAD-UASB, and average nitrogen removal contribution were 83.1% during significant stability of anammox and 9.2% during the denitrification process, respectively. The three-stage SAD process provides an environmental and economic approach for landfill leachate treatment since it has the advantage of 25.4% less oxygen, 100% organic matter savings and 47.9% less external sludge than traditional biological processes.

541,Current state and barriers to the circular economy in the building sector: Towards a mitigation framework,"Bilal, Muhammad; Khan, Khurram Iqbal Ahmad; Thaheem, Muhammad Jamaluddin; Nasir, Abdur Rehman","The building sector is amongst the major resource consuming and waste generating sectors of the economy. The paradigm of the circular economy has the potential to overcome the problems resulted due to adoption of the linear economic model by the building sector. The circular economy offers a new perspective for industrial ecosystems including materials and products being fed back into the supply chain as resources, thereby resulting in reduced consumption of primary resources and waste generation. The research on circular economy increased rapidly during recent years; however, a research gap exists on the assessment of current state and barriers to the circular economy in the building sector of developing countries. This study has developed and used a circular economy assessment scale for the building sector of developing countries. It is found that the current state of circular economy implementation in the building sector is unsatisfactory. Out of the seven circular economy dimensions used for analysis, the energy dimension showed the best performance and the waste dimension showed the worst performance. Serious steps are required by all the stakeholders of the building sector to improve the adoption of the circular economy. Furthermore, interpretive structural modeling (ISM) and matrice d'Impacts croises-multipication applique an classment (MICMAC) techniques are used to identify and classify the key barriers to the circular economy. It is found that a lack of environmental regulations and laws is driving the rest of the barriers to the circular economy. Equally critical is the lack of public awareness and support from public institutions. Finally, a mitigation framework for the building sector of developing countries is proposed, which is an addition to the circular economy existing body of knowledge. The proposed framework could serve as a guideline for decision and policymakers. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."
542,"Post-conflict development, reviewing the water sector in Somalia","Khaldoon A Mourad,Khaldoon A Mourad","Somali post-conflict development faces many challenges that affect the sustainability of the water sector. This paper reviews and analyses the post-conflict development activities in the water sector through local communications and reviewing published materials and databases from international players in Somalia, funding agencies and financial tracking service. The paper has shown that there has been great attention and support given to the country during its post-conflict development. However, most of these initiatives and projects have focused on emerging issues such as tackling food security and water, sanitation and hygiene services. The paper also shows that the continuous funding of emerging issues in Somalia has reduced its long-term sustainability of the water sector and limited its national and long-term benefits but has increased corruption due to increase the gap between actors and local people. Therefore, new transparent cooperative initiatives are needed based on transparent involvement and coordination among donors, local authorities and implementers to improve and develop the water sector and the livelihood in Somalia through a solid water governance system."
543,Environmental implications of increased US oil production and liberal growth agenda in post -Paris Agreement era,"Shahbaz, Muhammad; Kablan, Sandrine; Hammoudeh, Shawkat; Nasir, Muhammad Ali; Kontoleon, Andreas","Contextualising on the internationally low oil prices era and historically high oil production in USA and refusal to honour the commitments under Paris Agreement (COP: 21), this study investigates the role of education, oil prices and natural resources on energy demand and CO2 emissions in the USA for the period of 1976-2016. In so doing, we employed a bounds testing approach to cointegration accounting for structural breaks in the series. Key findings suggest the presence of a long-run association between underlying variables. The abundance of natural resources and economic growth of the US economy seem to weigh on environmental quality by increasing energy consumption and carbon emissions. Oil prices show a negative association with energy consumption as well as carbon emissions suggesting that a low oil prices regime can lead to an increase in carbon emissions and energy consumption. Interestingly, education seems to play an important role by reducing energy consumption and carbon emissions, resultantly improving the US environmental quality. Our findings have profound environmental implications in terms of efforts to tackle climate change and meeting the Paris agreement (COP: 21) ambitions with reality and USA policy stance."
544,System design and feasibility of trigeneration systems with hybrid photovoltaic-thermal (PVT) collectors for zero energy office buildings in different climates,"Braun, Reiner; Haag, Maximilian; Stave, Jonas; Abdelnour, Nermeen; Eicker, Ursula","Zero or plus energy office buildings must have very high building standards and require highly efficient energy supply systems due to space limitations for renewable installations. Conventional solar cooling systems use photovoltaic electricity or thermal energy to run either a compression-cooling machine or an absorption-cooling machine in order to produce cooling energy during daytime, while they use electricity from the grid for the nightly cooling energy demand. With a hybrid photovoltaic-thermal collector, electricity as well as thermal energy can be produced at the same time. These collectors can produce also cooling energy at nighttime by long-wave radiation exchange with the night sky and convection losses to the ambient air. Such a renewable trigeneration system offers new fields of applications. However, the technical, ecological and economical aspects of such systems are still largely unexplored. In this work, the potential of a PVT system to heat and cool office buildings in three different climate zones is investigated. In the investigated system, PVT collectors act as a heat source and heat sink for a reversible heat pump. Due to the reduced electricity consumption (from the grid) for heat rejection, the overall efficiency and economics improve compared to a conventional solar cooling system using a reversible air-to-water heat pump as heat and cold source. A parametric simulation study was carried out to evaluate the system design with different PVT surface areas and storage tank volumes to optimize the system for three different climate zones and for two different building standards. It is shown such a systems are technically feasible today. With a maximum utilization of PV electricity for heating, ventilation, air conditioning and other electricity demand such as lighting and plug loads, high solar fractions and primary energy savings can be achieved. Annual costs for such a system are comparable to conventional solar thermal and solar electrical cooling systems. Nevertheless, the economic feasibility strongly depends on country specific energy prices and energy policy. However, even in countries without compensation schemes for energy produced by renewables, this system can still be economically viable today. It could be shown, that a specific system dimensioning can be found at each of the investigated locations worldwide for a valuable economic and ecological operation of an office building with PVT technologies in different system designs."

The continuous exposure to ruinous molecules can lead to abnormal inflammatory responses, permanent damages to the respiratory system, and irreversible pathological changes. Other factors, such as genetics and aging, influence the development of COPD. In the last decade, accumulating evidence suggested that mitochondrial alteration, including mitochondrial DNA damage, increased mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS), abnormal autophagy, and apoptosis, have been implicated in the pathogenesis of COPD. The alteration can also extend to epigenetics, namely DNA methylation, histone modification, and non-coding RNA. This review will discuss the recent progressions in COPD pathology, pathophysiology, and molecular pathways. More focus will be shed on mitochondrial and epigenetic variations related to COPD development and the role of nanomedicine as a potential tool for the prevention and treatment of this disease."

547,Understanding global PM2.5 concentrations and their drivers in recent decades (1998-2016),"Lim, Chul-Hee; Ryu, Jieun; Choi, Yuyoung; Jeon, Seong Woo; Lee, Woo-Kyun","The threat of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) is increasing globally. Tackling this issue requires an accurate understanding of its trends and drivers. In this study, global risk regions of PM2.5 concentrations during 1998-2016 were spatiotemporally derived. Time series analysis was conducted in the spatial relationship between PM2.5 and three socio-environmental drivers: population, urban ratio, and vegetation greenness that can cause changes in the concentration of PM2.5. ""High Risk"" areas were widely distributed in India and China. In India and sub-Saharan Africa, the increased overall population was strongly correlated with PM2.5 concentrations. Urban ratio increased in both developed and developing countries. A ""decoupling"" phenomenon occurred in developed countries, where urban expansion continued while PM2.5 concentrations decreased. Vegetation greenness and PM2.5 were strongly correlated in High Risk zones. Although urban expansion and population growth generally reduce vegetation greenness, developed countries reduced PM2.5 while maintaining greenness, whereas developing countries increased PM2.5 with decreasing greenness significantly in High Risk regions. Ultimately, economic and national growth should occur without increasing PM2.5 concentrations. Recent cases from Europe and the eastern United States demonstrate that this is possible, depending on the development pathway."

549,Economic and environmental assessment of solar-wind-biomass hybrid renewable energy system supplying rural settlement load,"Jahangir, Mohammad Hossein; Cheraghi, Ramin","Hybrid renewable energy systems are becoming a popular option for rural electrification due to environmental impacts caused by fossil fuels like coal and oil. Iran is a developing country with many renewable energy sources, but most Iranian power plants use non-renewable resources to generate electricity. This study aims to present a hybrid renewable energy system consisting of photovoltaic panels, wind turbines, and biogas generator for rural electrification in Fars province, Iran. The utilization of this off-grid system prevents the development of fossil fuel power plants and CO2 emissions. The optimization problem is solved using the HOMER Pro software, and sensitivity analyses obtain optimal system configurations on input biomass rate, biomass price, and inflation rate parameters. The inflation rate and biomass price are directly related to the cost of electricity (COE). The results show that the COE in optimal systems ranges from 0.128 to $0.223/kW h. Increasing the biomass price from 20 to $60/ton reduces the biogas generator's power generation by at least 86%. The most optimal economic system involves a biogas generator (150 kW), photovoltaic panels (80.7 kW), batteries, and converter. The environmental assessment indicates that CO2 emissions from proposed hybrid renewable energy systems are negligible compared to a coal-based power plant and the grid. Reducing CO2 in the presented approach can save more than $8000 a year."

In this regard, dietary isatis is included in Nile tilapia diets to relieve atrazine (ATZ)-induced growth retardation, hepato-renal dysfunction, and oxidative stress. The first and second groups offered the control diet (control), while the third and fourth groups offered the isatis supplemented diet (1%). Meantime, half of the water was replaced and mixed with ATZ (1.39 mg/L) in the second and fourth groups for 30 days. The group of fish delivered isatis had significantly enhanced FBW, WG, and SGR, while fish intoxicated with ATZ had meaningfully impaired growth behavior (p < 0.05). Further, the FCR was improved by isatis, and ATZ resulted in the worst FCR among the groups. Interestingly fish fed isatis and exposed with ATZ (88.89%) had a higher survival rate than fish exposed with ATZ without isatis feeding, and both are lower than the control (97.78%) (p < 0.05). The histological structure in the isatis-treated groups showed distinguished enhancement and branching of the intestinal villi. The intestine of ATZ-treated fish revealed damage and inflammatory cell infiltration in the intestinal mucosa with separation of lining epithelium. Generally, fish fed isatis and intoxicated with ATZ had lower uric acid, urea, creatinine, ALT, and AST and higher total protein, globulin, and albumin than fish exposed with ATZ without feeding with isatis (p < 0.05). Markedly, fish-fed isatis had the highest SOD, CAT, GPx, and the lowest MDA level compared to the other groups (p < 0.05). Meanwhile, fish exposed with ATZ had the worst SOD, CAT, GPx, and the highest MDA level compared to the other groups (p < 0.05). In summary, dietary isatis relieved ATZ induced growth retardation, hepato-renal dysfunction, and oxidative stress in Nile tilapia."
551,Can indoor sports centers be allowed to re-open during the COVID-19 pandemic based on a certificate of equivalence?,"Blocken, B.; van Druenen, T.; van Hooff, T.; Verstappen, P. A.; Marchal, T.; Marr, L. C.","Within a time span of only a few months, the SARS-CoV-2 virus has managed to spread across the world. This virus can spread by close contact, which includes large droplet spray and inhalation of microscopic droplets, and by indirect contact via contaminated objects. While in most countries, supermarkets have remained open, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, authorities have ordered many other shops, restaurants, bars, music theaters and indoor sports centers to be closed. As part of COVID-19 (semi)lock-down exit strategies, many government authorities are now (May-June 2020) allowing a gradual re-opening, where sometimes indoor sport centers are last in line to be permitted to re-open. This technical note discusses the challenges in safely re-opening these facilities and the measures already suggested by others to partly tackle these challenges. It also elaborates three potential additional measures and based on these additional measures, it suggests the concept of a certificate of equivalence that could allow indoor sports centers with such a certificate to re-open safely and more rapidly. It also attempts to stimulate increased preparedness of indoor sports centers that should allow them to remain open safely during potential next waves of SARS-CoV-2 as well as future pandemics. It is concluded that fighting situations such as the COVID-19 pandemic and limiting economic damage requires increased collaboration and research by virologists, epidemiologists, microbiologists, aerosol scientists, building physicists, building services engineers and sports scientists."
552,Role of institutions in correcting environmental pollution: An empirical investigation,"Hassan, Syed Tauseef; Danish; Khan, Salah Ud-Din; Xia, Enjun; Fatima, Hani","A growing literature has highlighted that institutional quality is an effective tool for ensuring a country's sustainability. Institutions play a significant role in the country's development, and specifically in terms of air pollution. How institutional quality enhances or weakens air quality is not been extensively estimated in the literature. This study takes a step forward to investigate the role of institutional quality in CO2 emissions in Pakistan. An autoregressive distributed lag model (ARDL) is used for data spanning from 1984 to 2016 in the context of Pakistan. The result indicates cointegration among variable under consideration. Overall, empirical results infer that institutions result in increasing CO2 emissions in Pakistan. Moreover, institutions quality and CO2 emissions granger cause each other. Further, finding shows that more income reduces CO2 emissions over time, which validates the EKC existence for CO2 emissions. Our findings suggest there is a need to strengthen institutions to mitigate the environmental effect."
553,Global declines in human-driven mangrove loss,"Goldberg, Liza; Lagomasino, David; Thomas, Nathan; Fatoyinbo, Temilola","Global mangrove loss has been attributed primarily to human activity. Anthropogenic loss hotspots across Southeast Asia and around the world have characterized the ecosystem as highly threatened, though natural processes such as erosion can also play a significant role in forest vulnerability. However, the extent of human and natural threats has not been fully quantified at the global scale. Here, using a Random Forest-based analysis of over one million Landsat images, we present the first 30 m resolution global maps of the drivers of mangrove loss from 2000 to 2016, capturing both human-driven and natural stressors. We estimate that 62% of global losses between 2000 and 2016 resulted from land-use change, primarily through conversion to aquaculture and agriculture. Up to 80% of these human-driven losses occurred within six Southeast Asian nations, reflecting the regional emphasis on enhancing aquaculture for export to support economic development. Both anthropogenic and natural losses declined between 2000 and 2016, though slower declines in natural loss caused an increase in their relative contribution to total global loss area. We attribute the decline in anthropogenic losses to the regionally dependent combination of increased emphasis on conservation efforts and a lack of remaining mangroves viable for conversion. While efforts to restore and protect mangroves appear to be effective over decadal timescales, the emergence of natural drivers of loss presents an immediate challenge for coastal adaptation. We anticipate that our results will inform decision-making within conservation and restoration initiatives by providing a locally relevant understanding of the causes of mangrove loss."
554,Potassium distribution and isotope composition in the lithospheric mantle in relation to global Earth's reservoirs,"Dmitri A Ionov,Kun Wang,Dmitri A Ionov,Kun Wang","Recent analytical advances have provided means to measure potassium (K) isotopes in various terrestrial materials, but little is known about K distribution and stable isotope composition in the lithospheric mantle because of: (a) common low K abundances, (b) potential contamination and alteration, (c) diversity of mantle rocks and minerals hosting K in different tectonic settings. We report K abundances and δ41K values for well-studied whole-rock (WR) mantle xenoliths (spinel and garnet peridotites and pyroxenites) from mobile belts, a craton, a subduction zone, as well as for K-rich phases (mica, amphibole, silicate glass) and xenolith-bearing volcanic materials (67 samples). The xenolith materials show extremely broad ranges of K content (7 μg/g to 6.6 wt.%) and δ41K (-2.77‰ to 0.62‰). They contrast with the narrow δ41K range for host volcanic materials (-0.53‰ to -0.27‰) and literature data on oceanic basalts (melting products of upwelling asthenosphere: -0.43 ± 0.17‰, 2sd). Amphibole-bearing subduction zone peridotites show the highest WR δ41K values (0.40 to 0.62‰) likely inherited from fluids released into the mantle wedge from subducted oceanic crust. All other WR samples yield negative δ41K: -0.06‰ to -2.77‰ for peridotites and -0.17‰ to -0.52‰ for pyroxenites. The δ41K in K-rich mantle phases range from positive values (0.16 to 0.57‰) for phlogopite in strongly metasomatized peridotites to negative values (-0.27 to -0.94‰) for phlogopite, amphibole and glass pockets from other samples, which cannot be explained by equilibrium inter-mineral fractionation inferred from ab initio calculations. We attribute the broad δ41K variations to (a) isotope fractionation during fluid-rock interaction in the mantle, and (b) distinct sources of K-bearing fluids. Kinetic isotope fractionation during fluid percolation and diffusion is inferred for composite xenoliths (phlogopite and pyroxenite veins in peridotites) that have lower δ41K in the hosts than in the veins due to slower migration of 41K than 39K from the veins (former fluid channels) to host mantle. Overall, the K isotope fractionation in the lithospheric mantle appears to be greater than for magmatic fractionation in the crust. The average δ41K of normal off-craton continental lithospheric mantle calculated from the least altered fertile and lightly metasomatized lherzolites is -0.57 ± 0.28‰ (2sd). This value is within error (though a little lower) of estimates for both continental crust and MORB and OIB mantle sources indicating that these major silicate Earth reservoirs have similar bulk δ41K values, apparently due to low or negligible K isotopic fractionation during their formation by magmatic differentiation and melting. By contrast, K isotopes in modern and fossil subduction zones are fractionated via fluid-related equilibrium and kinetic processes."
555,Do Real Output and Renewable Energy Consumption Affect CO2 Emissions? Evidence for Selected BRICS Countries,"Liu, Jiang-Long; Ma, Chao-Qun; Ren, Yi-Shuai; Zhao, Xin-Wei","Climate change is one of the most important global problems faced by the international community. It is generally believed that increasing the consumption of renewable energy is an effective measure to promote CO2 emissions reduction. Therefore, renewable energy consumption has become one of the best alternative strategies for sustainable development. Based on this, this paper employs the 3SLS model to conduct an empirical study on the relations among real output, renewable energy consumption, and CO2 emissions of BRICS countries (except Russia) in 1999-2014. The empirical results support, for BRICS group, the complete tri-variate relationships (energy-output-emission nexus), and renewable energy had a significant positive impact on the real output, and vice versa. Besides, compared with other countries, Brazil also has the same tri-variate relationships as BRICS group. However, China has no relationship from real output to renewable energy consumption and from real output to CO2 emissions; India does not have the relationship from real output to renewable energy consumption and the bilateral relationship between real output and CO2 emissions; the relationship between variables in South Africa only occurs in the energy output chain. Finally, according to the estimation results of the simultaneous equation, the BRICs governments should consider the importance of human capital level and financial development when controlling the real output level and pollution. In addition, it should be noted that effective energy policies help to reduce carbon dioxide emissions without compromising real output."
556,Taxifolin improves inflammatory injury of human bronchial epithelial cells by inhibiting matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) 10 via Wnt/β-catenin pathway,"Youhua Chen,Yan Mei,Lu Yang,Weibin Li,Yu Zhou,Surong He,Jie Liang,Youhua Chen,Yan Mei,Lu Yang,Weibin Li,Yu Zhou,Surong He,Jie Liang","Taxifolin (TXL), also known as dihydroquercetin, is one of the most important flavonoids prevalent across the plant kingdom. Increasing evidence has demonstrated its critical role in respiratory diseases. The present study aims to reveal the detailed mechanism in TNF-α-stimulated BEAS-2B cells by which TXL might exert effects on the development of asthma. Cell viability detection of BEAS-2B treated with TXL before and after TNF-α induction employed MMT. The expressions of inflammatory cytokines, MUC5AC and ICAM-1 were determined by quantitative reverse transcription PCR (RT-qPCR), enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and Western blot after TXL was exposed to an in vitro asthma model. Then, light transmittance and apoptosis were then measured employing fluorescein transmittance, TUNEL and Western blot. After overexpressing MMP10, the abovementioned assays were performed again. Finally, the association between Wnt/β-catenin pathway and MMP10 was confirmed by detecting the proteins in this pathway. TXL increases the cell viability of TNF-induced BEAS-2B cells. TXL suppressed the inflammation, mucus formation, and apoptosis in TNF-α-induced BEAS-2B cells. Furthermore, after the prediction of binding sites between TXL and MMP10, it was found that overexpression of MMP10 reversed the effects of TXL on suppressing the progression of TNF-α-induced BEAS-2B cells. Finally, TXL blocked Wnt/β-catenin pathway by inhibiting MMP10 expression.TXL can be a promising drug for the treatment of asthma due to its inhibition of MMP10 expression by blocking Wnt/β-catenin pathway. Future experimental in vivo studies of asthma on this commonly used bioactive flavonoid could open new avenues for the therapies of asthma."
557,Water-energy scarcity nexus risk in the national trade system based on multiregional input-output and network environ analyses,"Liu, Yating; Chen, Bin","The risk of economic loss caused by water and energy scarcity can be transferred via economic trading activities. In this study, a network-based framework was proposed to assess the water/energy scarcity risk nexus in a national trade system based on the multiregional input-output analysis (MRIOA) and the information-based network environ analysis (NEA). The initial risk of water and energy scarcity for different sectors in each province was first estimated based on the regional water stress index (WSI), energy stress index (ESI), and water and energy consumption intensity. The initial risk of water-energy scarcity nexus was also accounted for by combining the intensity-based weighting schemes. Additionally, information-based NEA technique was applied to ascertain the distributed control relationships in the currency flow networks of the MRIO table. Then, the integral water scarcity risk transmission network, the integral energy scarcity risk transmission network and the integral water-energy scarcity nexus risk transmission network can be established via combining the corresponding initial risk and the control allocation matrix. Finally, a case study was conducted in China to quantify the propagation of water-energy scarcity risk among different regions and sectors, which considers both direct risk and integral risk, in the national trade system. The results showed that there are significant differences between the initial risk and integral risk of water-energy scarcity due to indirect effects and amplification effects in the network. Moreover, this study highlights that economic trade could transfer local water/energy scarcity to distant regions in the national economic system, i.e., local water/energy scarcity could not only cause economic loss locally or in adjacent regions, but also have tele-connected influences over geographically distant regions via the national supply chain. Hence, the economic incentives for local water or energy system management are increasingly inadequate compared with the needs of a resilient economy. The proposed water-energy scarcity risk nexus assessment framework can provide a network-based insight for identifying vulnerable provinces and sectors of water and energy scarcity to strengthen the resilience of the national economy and boost the synergies of water and energy management."
558,Biosorption performance of date palm empty fruit bunch wastes for toxic hexavalent chromium removal,"Rambabu, K.; Bharath, G.; Banat, Fawzi; Show, Pau Loke","Biosorption ability of date palm empty fruit bunch (DPEFB) was examined for the removal of toxic hexavalent chromium (Cr6+) ions from synthetic wastewater. The pretreated DPEFB biosorbent was studied for its morphology and surface chemistry through Scanning electron microscopy, Energy dispersive elemental analysis and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. Effect of biosorption parameters such as pH, biosorbent dosage, contact time, temperature, initial feed concentration and agitation speed on the Cr6+ ions removal efficiency by DPEFB was critically evaluated. The isoelectric point for the DPEFB sorbent was observed at pH 2, above which it was dehydronated to capture the positively charged Cr6+ ions. Batch biosorption studies showed that an optimal chromium removal efficiency of 58.02% was recorded by the DPEFB biosorbent for pH 2, dosage 0.3 g, 100 rpm agitation speed, 120 min contact time, 50 mg/L initial feed concentration and 30 degrees C operational temperature. Thermodynamic analysis showed that the binding of Cr6+ ions on DPEFB surface was exothermic, stable and favorable at room temperature. Equilibrium behavior of chromium binding on DPEFB was more aligned to Temkin isotherm (R-2 = 0.9852) highlighting the indirect interactions between Cr(6+ )ions and the biosorbent. Kinetic modeling revealed that the biosorption of Cr6+ ions by DPEFB obeyed pseudo-second order model than the pseudo-first order and intra-particle diffusion models. Reusability studies of the DPEFB sorbent showed that NaNO3 was an effective regenerant and the biosorbent can be efficiently reused up to three successive biosorption-desorption cycles for chromium removal. In summary, the results clearly showed that the DPEFB biowaste seems to be an efficient, economic and eco-friendly biosorbent for sustainable removal of toxic hexavalent chromium ions from domestic and industrial wastewater streams."
559,Dominance in humans,"Tian Chen Zeng,Joey T Cheng,Joseph Henrich,Tian Chen Zeng,Joey T Cheng,Joseph Henrich","Dominance captures behavioural patterns found in social hierarchies that arise from agonistic interactions in which some individuals coercively exploit their control over costs and benefits to extract deference from others, often through aggression, threats and/or intimidation. Accumulating evidence points to its importance in humans and its separation from prestige-an alternate avenue to high status in which status arises from information (e.g. knowledge, skill, etc.) or other non-rival goods. In this review, we provide an overview of the theoretical underpinnings of dominance as a concept within evolutionary biology, discuss the challenges of applying it to humans and consider alternative theoretical accounts which assert that dominance is relevant to understanding status in humans. We then review empirical evidence for its continued importance in human groups, including the effects of dominance-independently of prestige-on measurable outcomes such as social influence and reproductive fitness, evidence for specialized dominance psychology, and evidence for gender-specific effects. Finally, because human-specific factors such as norms and coalitions may place bounds on purely coercive status-attainment strategies, we end by considering key situations and contexts that increase the likelihood for dominance status to coexist alongside prestige status within the same individual, including how: (i) institutional power and authority tend to elicit dominance; (ii) dominance-enhancing traits can at times generate benefits for others (prestige); and (iii) certain dominance cues and ethology may lead to mis-attributions of prestige. This article is part of the theme issue 'The centennial of the pecking order: current state and future prospects for the study of dominance hierarchies'."
560,How to transition to reduced-meat diets that benefit people and the planet,"Rust, Niki A.; Ridding, Lucy; Ward, Caroline; Clark, Beth; Kehoe, Laura; Dora, Manoj; Whittingham, Mark J.; McGowan, Philip; Chaudha, Abhishek; Reynolds, Christian J.; Trivedy, Chet; West, Nicola","Overwhelming evidence shows that overconsumption of meat is bad for human and environmental health and that moving towards a more plant-based diet is more sustainable. For instance, replacing beef with beans in the US could free up 42% of US cropland and reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 334 mmt, accomplishing 75% of the 2020 carbon reduction target. We summarise the evidence on how overconsumption social, environmental and economic sustainability. We highlight the social, environmental and economic effectiveness of a range of dietary interventions that have been tested to date. Because meat eating is embedded within complex cultural, economic, and political systems, dietary shifts to reduce overconsumption are unlikely to happen quickly and a suite of sustained, context-specific interventions is likely to work better than brief, one-dimensional approaches. We conclude with key actions needed by global leaders in politics, industry and the health sector that could help aide this dietary transformation to benefit people and the planet.

561,A New Direction for Closed-Loop Spinal Cord Stimulation: Combining Contemporary Therapy Paradigms with Evoked Compound Action Potential Sensing,"Ricardo Vallejo,Krishnan Chakravarthy,Andrew Will,Karen Trutnau,David Dinsmoor,Ricardo Vallejo,Krishnan Chakravarthy,Andrew Will,Karen Trutnau,David Dinsmoor","Spinal cord stimulation (SCS) utilizes the delivery of mild electrical pulses via epidural electrodes placed on the dorsal side of the spinal cord, typically to treat chronic pain. The first clinical use of SCS involved the delivery of paresthesia inducing, low-frequency waveforms to the neural targets corresponding to the painful areas. Contemporary SCS therapies now leverage novel therapeutic pathways to limit paresthesia and deliver superior clinical outcomes. Historically, SCS has largely been delivered with fixed stimulation parameters. This approach, referred to as open-loop (OL) SCS, does not account for the fluctuations in spacing-driven by postural changes and activity-between the electrodes and the cord. These fluctuations result in variability in the delivered dose and the volume of tissue activation (VTA) that manifests with each stimulation pulse. Inconsistent dosing may lead to suboptimal therapeutic efficacy and durability. To address this clinical need, closed-loop (CL) SCS systems have been developed to automatically adjust stimulation parameters to compensate for this variability. The evoked compound action potential (ECAP), a biopotential generated by the synchronous activation of dorsal column fibers, is indicative of the VTA resulting from the stimulation pulse. The ECAP may be utilized as a control signal in CL SCS systems to adjust stimulation parameters to reduce variability in the ECAP, and in turn, variability in the VTA. While investigational CL SCS systems with ECAP sensing have so far focused solely on managing paresthesia-based SCS, such systems must also incorporate the stimulation approaches that now define the contemporary clinical practice of SCS. Accordingly, we describe here a flexible, next-generation framework for neural responsive SCS that blends science-based methodologies for pain management with real-time CL control for biophysical variation. We conclude with a clinical example of such a system and the associated performance characteristics."
562,EU bioenergy development to 2050,"Mandley, S. J.; Daioglou, V; Junginger, H. M.; van Vuuren, D. P.; Wicke, B.","Bioenergy is the EU's leading renewable energy source at present. Understanding bioenergy's contribution to the future EU energy mix is strategically relevant for mid to long term climate targets. This review consolidates recent projections of both supply and demand dynamics for EU bioenergy to 2050, drawing from resource-focused, demand-driven and integrated assessment approaches. Projections are synthesised to identify absolute ranges, determine cohesion with policy and draw insights on the implications for the scale of development, trade and energy security. Supply side studies have undergone methodological harmonisation efforts in recent years. Despite this, due to assumptions on key uncertainties such as feedstock yields, technical potential estimates range from 9 to 25 EJyr-1 of EU domestically available biomass for energy in 2050. Demand side projections range between 5 and 19 EJyr-1 by 2050. This range is primarily due to variations in study assumptions on key influential developments such as economic competitivity of bioenergy, EU energy efficiency gains within the power sector, flexibility for meeting mitigation targets and technological portfolios. Upper bound technical supply estimates are able meet future demand wholly from the domestic resource base, holding the potential to reduce total EU primary energy import dependency 22% points from the current EU roadmap trajectory. However, due to part of this domestic resource base being deemed economically inaccessible or of insufficient quality, interregional imports are projected to increase from current 4% to 13-76%. Emergence of non-energy applications are projected to compete for at least 10% of the biomass needed to fulfil bioenergy demand in 2050."
563,Distinct mutations and lineages of SARS-CoV-2 virus in the early phase of COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent 1-year global expansion,"Yan Chen,Shiyong Li,Wei Wu,Shuaipeng Geng,Mao Mao,Yan Chen,Shiyong Li,Wei Wu,Shuaipeng Geng,Mao Mao","A novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, has caused over 274 million cases and over 5.3 million deaths worldwide since it occurred in December 2019 in Wuhan, China. Here we conceptualized the temporospatial evolutionary and expansion dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 by taking a series of the cross-sectional view of viral genomes from early outbreak in January 2020 in Wuhan to the early phase of global ignition in early April, and finally to the subsequent global expansion by late December 2020. Based on the phylogenetic analysis of the early patients in Wuhan, Wuhan/WH04/2020 is supposed to be a more appropriate reference genome of SARS-CoV-2, instead of the first sequenced genome Wuhan-Hu-1. By scrutinizing the cases from the very early outbreak, we found a viral genotype from the Seafood Market in Wuhan featured with two concurrent mutations (i.e., M type) had become the overwhelmingly dominant genotype (95.3%) of the pandemic 1 year later. By analyzing 4013 SARS-CoV-2 genomes from different continents by early April, we were able to interrogate the viral genomic composition dynamics of the initial phase of global ignition over a time span of 14 weeks. Eleven major viral genotypes with unique geographic distributions were also identified. WE1 type, a descendant of M and predominantly witnessed in western Europe, consisted of half of all the cases (50.2%) at the time. The mutations of major genotypes at the same hierarchical level were mutually exclusive, which implies that various genotypes bearing the specific mutations were propagated during human-to-human transmission, not by accumulating hot-spot mutations during the replication of individual viral genomes. As the pandemic was unfolding, we also used the same approach to analyze 261 323 SARS-CoV-2 genomes from the world since the outbreak in Wuhan (i.e., including all the publicly available viral genomes) to recapitulate our findings over 1-year time span. By December 25, 2020, 95.3% of global cases were M type and 93.0% of M-type cases were WE1. In fact, at present all the five variants of concern (VOC) are the descendants of WE1 type. This study demonstrates that viral genotypes can be utilized as molecular barcodes in combination with epidemiologic data to monitor the spreading routes of the pandemic and evaluate the effectiveness of control measures. Moreover, the dynamics of viral mutational spectrum in the study may help the early identification of new strains in patients to reduce further spread of infection, guide the development of molecular diagnosis and vaccines against COVID-19, and help assess their accuracy and efficacy in real world at real time."

The activity of the compounds against axenic cultures of Trypanosoma cruzi epimastigtotes and trypomastigotes, as well as intracellular amastigotes, is described, together with their cytotoxic activity against three different human cell lines. The synthetic strategy for the preparation of the new compounds was based on the reactivity at the C4 position of the furoquinoline core towards nucleophiles. The new derivatives were synthesized by a Buchwald-Hartwig reaction, in most cases under green, solvent-free conditions. Compounds 1 c and 1 e displayed better in-vitro activity against trypomastigotes than benznidazole and nifurtimox (positive controls) with IC50 <4 μM. In addition, both compounds were not cytotoxic against the three human cell lines K562 (erytroleukimia), LM2 (breast cancer), and HaCat (keratinocyte). Interestingly, when evaluated against intracellular amastigotes, compound 1 c was able to significantly reduce the number of this parasite form, compared to the negative control."

Recent findings suggest that fear generalisation is closely related to hippocampal dependency during retrieval. In this review, we describe the current understanding about memory generalisation and its potential influence in fear attenuation through pharmacological and behavioural interventions. In light of systems consolidation framework, we propose that keeping memory precision could be a key step to enhance therapeutic outcomes."
567,Efficiency of grey wolf optimization algorithm for damage detection of skeletal structures via expanded mode shapes,"Ghannadi, Parsa; Kourehli, Seyed Sina; Noori, Mohammad; Altabey, Wael A.","Vibration-based structural damage identification through optimization techniques has become an interesting research topic in recent years. Dynamic characteristics such as frequencies and mode shapes are used to construct the objective function. The objective functions based on only frequencies are not very sensitive to damage in large structures. However, objective functions based on both mode shapes and frequencies are very effective. In real measurement condition, the number of installed sensors is limited, and there are no economic reasons for measuring the mode shapes at all degrees of freedom. In this kind of circumstances, mode expansion methods are used to address the incompleteness of mode shapes. In this article, the system equivalent reduction and expansion process is applied to determine the unmeasured mode shapes. Two experimental examples including a cantilever beam and a truss tower are investigated to show system equivalent reduction and expansion process' efficiency in estimating unmeasured mode shapes. The results show that the technique used for expansion is influential. Damage identification is formulated as an optimization problem, and the residual force vector based on expanded mode shapes is considered as an objective function. In order to minimize the objective function, grey wolf optimization and Harris hawks optimization are used. Numerical studies on a 56-bar dome space truss and experimental validation on a steel frame are performed to demonstrate the efficiency of the developed approach. Both numerical and experimental results indicate that the combination of the grey wolf optimization and expanded mode shapes with system equivalent reduction and expansion process can provide a reliable approach for determining the severities and locations of damage of skeletal structures when it compares with those obtained by Harris hawks optimization."
568,The effect of China's pilot carbon emissions trading schemes on poverty alleviation: A quasi-natural experiment approach,"Zhang, Guanglai; Zhang, Ning","As an important new tool for ecological poverty alleviation, carbon trading compensation is combining ecological protection with rural poverty alleviation. This paper evaluates the poverty alleviation impact of China's pilot carbon emissions trading schemes (ETS) at the provincial level before and after the program, which was implemented from 2007 to 2017. Specifically, we measure poverty alleviation in terms of rural residential income growth and rural job creation. By exploiting the quasi-experimental variation in whether provinces were affected by this pilot ETS policy, our analysis finds that the ETS policy resulted in increases in rural residential income and employment. We find the estimated effects correspond to an increase of approximately 752.6 yuan in annual rural residential income and 2.35% in the ratio of rural employed population to the total employed population, accounting for 9.5% of the rural residents' income and 7.11% of the rural employment, specifically. The results imply that the implementation of ETS is beneficial to income growth and job creation for rural areas of China, which mean the ETS policy may be conducive to poverty alleviation in affected provinces."
569,The Association Between Bullying Victimization and Fighting in School Among US High School Students,"Marco Chacon,Anita Raj,Marco Chacon,Anita Raj","In-school fighting often results in severe punishment and compromised learning outcomes, without adequate consideration of contextual factors or student vulnerabilities. In this study, using a large, nationally representative data sample from the 2019 Youth Risk Behavior Survey (N = 13677), we assessed associations between a history of bullying victimization (at school and online) and past year fighting at school among U.S. high school students. Multiple regression models were used, adjusting first for demographics, and then for demographics and emotional-behavioral risks (depressive symptoms, alcohol consumption, and sexual violence victimization), for the total sample and then stratified by gender/sex. Both cyberbullying and in-school bullying were significantly associated with past year in-school fighting for the total sample, with associations retained, but marginally attenuated in fully adjusted models (cyberbullying: AOR: 1.30; 95% CI: 1.01-1.66 and in-school bullying: AOR: 1.96, 95% CI: 1.57-2.45). Gender/sex-stratified models demonstrated retained associations for males (cyberbullying: AOR: 1.93; 1.51-2.46 and in-school bullying: AOR: 2.70, 95% CI: 2.18-3.34) and females (cyberbullying: AOR: 1.89; 1.33-2.68 and in-school bullying: AOR: 1.66, 95% CI: 1.19-2.33) after adjusting for demographics, but only for males after adjusting for demographics and emotional-behavior risk factors (cyberbullying: AOR: 1.43; 95% CI: 1.07-1.93 and in-school bullying: AOR: 2.25; 95% CI: 1.73-2.92). These results demonstrate a significant association between bullying victimization and fighting, which was amplified for male students, and partially explained by social and emotional risks. This suggests that punitive approaches to fighting in school may be resulting in compounded harms for already vulnerable adolescents and that support-oriented approaches emphasizing conflict resolution, social-emotional well-being, positive gender identity development, and bullying prevention may be more appropriate."
570,Linear IGA bullous dermatosis potentially triggered by vaccination,"Alberto Corrà,Veronica Bonciolini,Lavinia Quintarelli,Alice Verdelli,Marzia Caproni,Alberto Corrà,Veronica Bonciolini,Lavinia Quintarelli,Alice Verdelli,Marzia Caproni","Linear IgA bullous dermatosis (LABD) is a mucocutaneous autoimmune blistering disease affecting both adults and children. It is caused by IgA antibodies targeting multiple antigens along the basement membrane zone, leading to disruption of dermoepidermal junction and development of bullous lesions which often presents in characteristic arrangement. Although most LABD cases have been reported to be idiopathic, different triggers have been described, including several drugs and infection. However, the occurrence of vaccine-induced cases of LABD is not widely known and accepted due to the few reports available. We present two cases of LABD occurred following different triggers, rising the suspicion for a possible pathogenetic role of vaccines."
571,Impact of financial development on CO2 emissions: A comparative analysis of developing countries (D-8) and developed countries (G(8)),"Shoaib, Hafiz Muhammad; Rafique, Muhammad Zahid; Nadeem, Abdul Majeed; Huang, Shaoan","Financial development is one of the key drivers of rapid economic growth as well as CO2 emission in the environment. This study aims to investigate the casual links between financial development and CO2 emission in G8 and D8 countries for the time period from 1999 to 2013. We used PCA to develop financial development index from its five sub-components. Second-generation panel unit root tests are applied to check the stationary level and to tackle the presence of cross-sectional dependence in panels. The empirical results of PMG-panel ARDL technique show that financial development has significant and positive impact on carbon emission at a 1% statistical level in both panels in the long-run. The impact of financial development and energy consumption is more evident in D-8 and G(8) countries respectively. The energy use and trade openness affect positively while GDP significantly causes to decline the carbon emissions at 1% statistical level. The results of D-H causality test show that majority of the variables have one-way causality towards CO(2)emission in both panels except the financial development and energy use having two-way causality in G8 panel only. The empirical findings of the present study suggest that through improved financial system, more funds should be invested in clean energy projects to adopt the renewable energy, strict monetary policies should be implemented to reduce the consumption of big ticket items, and adoption of measure to reduce trade embodied emission is suggested."
572,Sustainable energy planning for cost minimization of autonomous hybrid microgrid using combined multi-objective optimization algorithm,"Haidar, Ahmed M. A.; Fakhar, Adila; Helwig, Andreas","With the development of scattered energy resources in the rural areas of Sarawak (Malaysia), various operational problems due to the unplanned installation of autonomous microgrids become gradually remarkable. To address this concern, the paper proposes an optimal strategy to evaluate the performance of different hybrid microgrid configurations for the Long San Village in Sarawak. A mathematical model is presented for sizing the component of the system to meet the maximum load demand under changing weather conditions and at the lowest possible cost. The developed approach simulates different microgrid models using deterministic and stochastic optimization methods to find the exact dynamic energy price of the selected optimal configuration in the context of system uncertainties. Furthermore, the operational feasibility of the system in terms of reliability and voltage security is studied in addition to economic feasibility with a comparative analysis of the environmental impact. The results show that the optimal configuration with the lowest cost of energy and net present cost can be achieved if the installed solar PV is less than 61 kW with 85 kW h of energy storage and 11 kW of hydro generation, where such system has 55,725 (kg/year) Carbon Dioxide and 330 (kg/year) Nitrogen Oxides. The findings also indicate that the dynamic energy pricing increases to 0.71 $/kWh when the power generation from renewable resources drops to zero. Further, the dynamic analysis shows that in order to reduce the voltage drop during disturbances, it is crucial to carefully install the sources in the buses connected to high energy demand."
573,Effects of urbanization on energy efficiency in China: New evidence from short run and long run efficiency models,"Lv, Yulan; Chen, Wei; Cheng, Jianquan","Energy efficiency in China has been the cause for increasing concern for national and local sustainable development due to rapid economic development and large-scale energy consumption. Using panel data of 30 provinces between 1997 and 2016 in China, the measurement of energy efficiency is disentangled, and the effects of urbanization on different types of energy efficiency are explored. First, the measurement of energy efficiency is disentangled, with long-run and short-run efficiencies derived. Results of energy efficiency scores highlight the predominant status of long-run inefficiency is low and that disparate energy efficiency is present between provinces. Second, the effects of urbanization were found to be significantly negative on short-run, long-run and overall energy efficiency. Comparatively, the effect of urbanization on long-run efficiency was shown to have recently grown, implying an urgent call for energy conservation during rapid urbanization. Finally, this study outlines broader implications and suggests policies to improve energy efficiency. Here, application of energy conservation technology, industrial structure upgrading and efficiency information disclosure to urban residents are thought to be smart ways to improve energy efficiency."

575,Earth observation-based ecosystem services indicators for national and subnational reporting of the sustainable development goals,"Cochran, Ferdouz; Daniel, Jessica; Jackson, Laura; Neale, Anne","Decision-making that impacts sustainability occurs at national and subnational levels, highlighting the need for multi-scale Earth observations (EO) and geospatial data for assessing the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). EnviroAtlas, developed by the United States Environmental Protection Agency and partners, provides a collection of web-based, interactive maps of environmental and socio-economic data relevant to the SDGs. EnviroAtlas maps ecosystem services indicators at national, regional, and local extents that can contribute to targets set forth in numerous goals, such as SDG 6 for clean water, SDG 11 for sustainable cities and communities, and SDG 15 for life on land. Examples of EnviroAtlas indicators that provide a way to view spatial inequalities, help fill gaps in environmental indicators, and integrate socio-economic and environmental data for the SDGs are explored herein. Remotely sensed EO data are essential for producing these indicators and informing planning and decision-making for the SDGs at subnational scales. The National Land Cover Dataset is the basis for many EnviroAtlas maps at the national extent, while National Agriculture Imagery Program and Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data are used to classify Meter-scale Urban Land Cover in select US metro areas. These 30 m and 1 m land cover products are combined with demographic and other geospatial data (remotely sensed and otherwise) to produce integrated indicators that can aid in target setting of the SDGs. Though EnviroAtlas was created for the conterminous US, the methods for indicator creation are transferable, and the open-source code for the EnviroAtlas resource may serve as an example for other nations. Achieving the SDGs means assessing targets and decision-making outcomes at local, regional, and national levels using consistent and accurate data. Geospatial resources like EnviroAtlas that provide open access to indicators based on EO data and allow for assessment at multiple extents and resolutions are critical to broadly addressing national to subnational SDG goals and targets."
576,Anaesthesia for mechanical thrombectomy: a narrative review,"J E Dinsmore,A Tan,J E Dinsmore,A Tan","Stroke is a leading cause of death and disability, and is associated with a huge societal and economic burden. Interventions for the immediate treatment of ischaemic stroke due to large vessel occlusion are dependent on recanalisation of the occluded vessel. Trials have provided evidence supporting the efficacy of mechanical thrombectomy in ischaemic stroke due to large vessel occlusion. This has resulted in changes in management and organisation of stroke care worldwide. Major determinants of effectiveness of thrombectomy include: time between stroke onset and reperfusion; location of occlusion and local collateral perfusion; adequacy of reperfusion; patient age; and stroke severity. The role of anaesthetic technique on outcome remains controversial with published research showing conflicting results. As a result, choice of conscious sedation or general anaesthesia for mechanical thrombectomy is often dependent on individual operator choice or institutional preference. More recent randomised controlled trials have suggested that protocol-driven general anaesthesia is no worse than conscious sedation and may even be associated with better outcomes. These and other studies have highlighted the importance of optimal blood pressure management as a major determinant of patient outcome. Anaesthetic management should be tailored to the individual patient and circumstances. Acute ischaemic stroke is a neurological emergency; clinicians should focus on minimising door-to-groin puncture time and the provision of high-quality periprocedural care with a particular emphasis on the maintenance of an adequate blood pressure."

578,Puberty enables oestradiol-induced progesterone synthesis in female mouse hypothalamic astrocytes,"Margaret A Mohr,Tina Keshishian,Brennan A Falcy,Blake J Laham,Angela M Wong,Paul E Micevych,Margaret A Mohr,Tina Keshishian,Brennan A Falcy,Blake J Laham,Angela M Wong,Paul E Micevych","The development of oestrogen positive feedback is a hallmark of female puberty. Both oestrogen and progesterone signalling are required for the functioning of this neuroendocrine feedback loop but the physiological changes that underlie the emergence of positive feedback remain unknown. Only after puberty does oestradiol (E2) facilitate progesterone synthesis in the rat female hypothalamus (neuroP), an event critical for positive feedback and the LH surge. We hypothesize that prior to puberty, these astrocytes have low levels of membrane oestrogen receptor alpha (ERα), which is needed for facilitation of neuroP synthesis. Thus, we hypothesized that prepubertal astrocytes are unable to respond to E2 with increased neuroP synthesis due a lack of membrane ERα. To test this, hypothalamic tissues and enriched primary hypothalamic astrocyte cultures were acquired from prepubertal (postnatal week 3) and post-pubertal (week 8) female mice. E2-facilitated neuroP was measured in the hypothalamus pre- and post-puberty, and hypothalamic astrocyte responses were measured after treatment with E2. Prior to puberty, E2-facilitated neuroP synthesis did not occur in the hypothalamus, and mERα expression was low in hypothalamic astrocytes, but E2-facilitated neuroP synthesis in the rostral hypothalamus and mERα expression increased post-puberty. The increase in mERα expression in hypothalamic astrocytes corresponded with a post-pubertal increase in caveolin-1 protein, PKA phosphorylation, and a more rapid [Ca2+ ]i flux in response to E2. Together, results from the present study indicate that E2-facilitated neuroP synthesis occurs in the rostral hypothalamus, develops during puberty, and corresponds to a post-pubertal increase in mERα levels in hypothalamic astrocytes."

Organ procurement organizations (OPOs) are permitted to deviate from the mandated match-run in exceptional circumstances. Using match-run data for all deceased donor kidney transplants (Ktx) in the US between 2015 and 2019, we identified 1544 kidneys transplanted from 933 donors with an OPO-initiated allocation exception. Most OPOs (55/58) used this process at least once, but 3 OPOs performed 64% of the exceptions and just 2 transplant centers received 25% of allocation exception Ktx. At 2 of 3 outlier OPOs these transplants increased 136% and 141% between 2015 and 2019 compared to only a 35% increase in all Ktx. Allocation exception donors had less favorable characteristics (median KDPI 70, 41% with history of hypertension), but only 29% had KDPI ≥ 85% and the majority did not meet the traditional threshold for marginal kidneys. Allocation exception kidneys went to larger centers with higher offer acceptance ratios and to recipients with 2 fewer priority points-equivalent to 2 less years of waiting time. OPO-initiated exceptions for kidney allocation are growing increasingly frequent and more concentrated at a few outlier centers. Increasing pressure to improve organ utilization risks increasing out-of-sequence allocations, potentially exacerbating disparities in access to transplantation."

Ramucirumab, a human anti-VEGFR-2 monoclonal antibody, is approved as a monotherapy for the treatment of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma and α-fetoprotein levels ≥400 ng/mL previously treated with sorafenib. As most patients present with an advanced disease, patients with α-fetoprotein levels ≥400 ng/mL have an aggressive disease and a poor prognosis, making ramucirumab an important treatment option for this subgroup of patients. This article provides a comprehensive review of the clinical efficacy of ramucirumab as highlighted in the two major trials that lead to its approval. We also briefly review the agent pharmacologic properties, as well as its safety and toxicity profile, before discussing certain limitations and challenges associated with ramucirumab use. Finally, we review completed and ongoing clinical trials and focus on those involving ramucirumab-based combinations, namely with immune therapy."
581,The impact of low-carbon city construction on ecological efficiency: Empirical evidence from quasi-natural experiments,"Song, Malin; Zhao, Xin; Shang, Yuping","Building a low-carbon city is an important guarantee to optimize the ecological environment and the key to improving ecological efficiency. This study conducts a quasi-natural experiment using panel data of China's 286 prefecture-level cities from 2003 to 2016. It evaluates the influence of low-carbon city construction on urban ecological efficiency using the difference-in-difference (DID) method and tests the robustness of the empirical results. In addition, it explores the influence mechanism on urban ecological efficiency and further investigates the differential influence based on heterogeneous resource dependence and urban scale. The results show that: (1) China's low-carbon city pilot (LCCP) policy has significantly improved urban ecological efficiency, as confirmed through a series of robustness tests. (2) In terms of action mechanisms, the LCCP policy in 2012 improved urban ecological efficiency only through the technological innovation path and not through industrial structure advancement or energy utilization efficiency; there is room to expand the scope and enhance the effectiveness of the LCCP policy. (3) Regarding urban heterogeneity, resource-based cities are constrained by the dilemma of resource dependence and the construction of low-carbon cities has a weak effect on improving ecological efficiency. Similarly, the economic agglomeration effect of megacities can further strengthen the role of low-carbon city construction in improving ecological efficiency, while the effect is weak in small and medium-sized cities. This study's conclusions reliably evaluate the results of the current low-carbon city construction and suggest a feasible path for further implementation of the related policy."

The Quantile cointegration proposed by Xiao (2009), Quantile-on-Quantile regression (QQ) proposed by Sim and Zhou (2015), and Quantile Autoregressive Granger causality developed by Troster et al. (2018) are applied. In particular, we examine to which extent, quantiles of technological progression affect the quantiles of ambient air pollution, by developing separate indicators for both the mentioned aspects using Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Our empirical findings unfold mutual dependence between technological progression and ambient air pollution. Furthermore, the results of Quantile Autoregressive Granger causality test conclude a bidirectional causal relationship between technological progression and ambient air pollution."
583,Sustainable Business Model Based on Digital Twin Platform Network: The Inspiration from Haier's Case Study in China,"Li, Xiao; Cao, Jiarou; Liu, Zhenggang; Luo, Xinggang","Sustainability and digitalization have become the main direction of transformation of enterprises. Building a digital twin platform network can provide enterprises with a comprehensive view of products, manufacture, supply chain, customer experience, and profitability, which is conducive to the construction of a sustainable business model. The purpose of this paper is to study how enterprises use digital twin platform networks to generate economic, social and environmental benefits in various dimensions and their coupling relationships. Based on the literature review, this paper constructs a five-dimensional framework of a sustainable business model, and analyses the coupling relationship between dimensions. Using Haier as a way to verify the five-dimensional framework, it explores the dynamic mechanism of the Haier digital twin platform network, constructs an integrated framework based on coupling perspective and compares it with other two home appliance enterprises. The study shows that, through the digital twin platform network, enterprises can remove the disadvantage of focusing on a single product life cycle, and form a comprehensive network, so as to promote overall sustainable upgrades. This paper draws generic strategies and digital transformation suggestions for enterprises to innovate the sustainable business model. The conclusion enriches the research on sustainable business models both theoretically and practically and provides a feasible reference for the transformation of enterprises in digital economy environment."
584,Microstructure of synthetic composite interfaces and verification of mixing order in cold-recycled asphalt emulsion mixture,"Chen, Tian; Ma, Tao; Huang, Xiaoming; Ma, Shijie; Tang, Fanlong; Wu, Shaopeng","Cold recycling technology is getting more and more attention due to economic and environmental benefits by reduced energy consumption and resource conservation. However, its application has been limited to the base and subbase layer because of complicated components and poor crack resistance for the last decades. The design method has shortcomings especially the traditional mixing order, which may be one of the reasons for poor crack resistance. To support the viewpoint above, synthetic composite interfaces were designed to simulate the worst situation during the traditional mixing process and observed in micro scale by scanning electron microscopy. In the microstructure of the traditional mixing order, it was apparent that cement paste had a number of microdefects, a signal of lower interfacial adhesive strength. Moreover, based on the microscopic observation, the adding sequence of cement ought to be changed and two optimized mixing orders were designed of which the difference was verified by the SEM observation of synthetic composite interfaces and the mechanical experiments for different curing time. It can be summarized that mechanical performance was consistent with the microscopic observation. The traditional mixing order was the worst one both in the strength and moisture sensitivity. Finally, the optimal mixing order is put forward to decrease the possibility of the adverse interface, that is, the graded aggregates are mixed with additional water first to reach the workability, while cement, asphalt emulsion and mineral powder are mixed to form cement-asphalt emulsion mortar, finally mixing them all up.

586,Research on coupling degree and coupling path between China's carbon emission efficiency and industrial structure upgrading,"Zhou, Di; Zhang, Xiaoru; Wang, Xueqin","To coordinate economic development and carbon emission reduction targets, China needs to improve carbon emission efficiency and upgrade the industrial structure. Therefore, it is important to study the coupling degree and coupling path between these two factors in various provinces in China, and thereby promote the development of China's low-carbon economy. We first calculate carbon emission efficiency using the Super-SBM model, then analyze an extended coupling model between carbon emission efficiency and industrial structure upgrading, and finally design the coupling paths using the framework of distribution dynamics. There are three main findings. First, the coupling degree of nearly half the provinces is at the level of mild-to-moderate imbalance recession. And in terms of specific coupling characteristics, nearly half the provinces belong to the type ""low-level coordination,"" with a low development degree and high coordination degree. Second, there is an obvious dynamic imbalance between China's carbon emission efficiency and industrial structure upgrading, and the ""low-level trap"" of regional carbon emission efficiency is more serious than that of regional industrial structure upgrading. Finally, if the government prioritizes provinces with low carbon emission efficiency, carbon emission efficiency and the coupling efficiency with industrial structure can be improved, which would not only improve the coupling degree within each region but also alleviate the disharmony between regions."
587,Structural and functional properties of a magnesium transporter of the SLC11/NRAMP family,"Karthik Ramanadane,Monique S Straub,Raimund Dutzler,Cristina Manatschal,Karthik Ramanadane,Monique S Straub,Raimund Dutzler,Cristina Manatschal","Members of the ubiquitous SLC11/NRAMP family catalyze the uptake of divalent transition metal ions into cells. They have evolved to efficiently select these trace elements from a large pool of Ca2+ and Mg2+, which are both orders of magnitude more abundant, and to concentrate them in the cytoplasm aided by the cotransport of H+ serving as energy source. In the present study, we have characterized a member of a distant clade of the family found in prokaryotes, termed NRMTs, that were proposed to function as transporters of Mg2+. The protein transports Mg2+ and Mn2+ but not Ca2+ by a mechanism that is not coupled to H+. Structures determined by cryo-EM and X-ray crystallography revealed a generally similar protein architecture compared to classical NRAMPs, with a restructured ion binding site whose increased volume provides suitable interactions with ions that likely have retained much of their hydration shell."
588,Oil supply risk and affecting parameters associated with oil supplementation and disruption,"Iqbal, Wasim; Fatima, Arooj; Hou Yumei; Abbas, Qaiser; Iram, Robina","The fossil fuel energy carriers significantly affect the energy security. The oil security has turned to one of the main political agenda by considering the two world's oil crises. In this study, an index of oil supply vulnerability has been developed to compare the world's top fifteen oil importing South Asian countries. The index includes comprehensive set of indicators like imported oil over GDP ratio, market liquidity, GDP per capita, geopolitical risk, diversification, the ratio of oil importation over consumption, transportation risk, oil price volatility and US $ volatility. Two popular techniques (composite indicator (CI) and the principal component analysis (PCA)) were used to combine all the aforesaid indicators. Although numerous techniques have been used to assess the oil vulnerability index, for example DEA like models and Markowitz theory of portfolio, none of them incorporated the principal component analysis and composite indicator together to develop an oil vulnerability index. Results shows that the South Asian countries have highest economic, supply and overall oil vulnerability risk whereas the second group countries Belgium, Thailand, Spain, Netherlands, Japan, Korea, India and China are in a relatively less risky as compared to South Asian countries. Contrary to this third group of countries are Canada, Singapore, UK, and France, Italy, Germany and US are considered as a least vulnerable country. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."

Few studies, however, have directly compared responses across popular exercises such as the best-possible-self intervention, the gratitude letter, or self-compassionate writing. In addition, current evidence is ambiguous regarding the effects of potential moderator variables such as trait gratitude and emotional self-awareness. To address these issues, we randomized 432 German adults to perform either optimism, gratitude, self-compassion, or control writing interventions in an online setting. Participants reported trait gratitude and trait emotional self-awareness before the interventions, as well as momentary optimism, gratitude, self-compassion, positive affect, and current thoughts immediately after the interventions. Results indicate higher momentary optimism after the best-possible-self intervention and higher momentary gratitude after the gratitude letter than after the control task. There were no differences when comparing the best-possible-self intervention with the gratitude letter. Both interventions increased the number of positive self-relevant thoughts. The self-compassion condition showed no effects. Moderation analysis results indicate that neither emotional self-awareness nor trait gratitude moderated the intervention effects. Future studies should compare responses across different positive-psychological interventions using more comprehensive exercises to ensure larger effects."

592,"A research on coordination between economy, society and environment in China: A case study of Jiangsu","Xu, Mingxue; Hu, Wen-Quan","Environmental stresses with remarkable economic growths in China entail a transformation of development from the traditional path to a coordinated and sustainable one. Based on the connotation of development, this paper constructs a combined model of economic-social-environmental system, coupling with the entropy weight method, to measure the coordinated development of a combined system ESE as well as the subsystems. Via the data of economic growth, social construction and environmental protection in Jiangsu from 2002 to 2017, this study analyzes the current situations and problems faced by Jiangsu, so as to achieve a comprehensive development. Main results show that all the four kinds of coordinated degrees present an upward trend, where the economic-social coordination rises fast, the volatility is insignificant and the gap between different cities is not obvious. The timevariation and space-distribution characteristics of the economy-environment, society-environment and overall development coordination are basically similar. The reason for such fluctuations is the changes in the macroeconomic environment, which have led to an unordered variation in economic development, and the level of social development is mainly affected by the availability of social public service facilities. The fluctuations in environmental systems are mainly due to changes inwater resources and sewage discharges, which are also the main factors affecting the overall development coordination level. Therefore, to further promote the sustainable development and optimize the spatial layout in Jiangsu, it is necessary to eliminate such problems as imperfect public construction and insufficient environmental protection and accelerate the economic transformation and upgrading.

593,The build-up of dominance hierarchies in eusocial insects,"Hiroyuki Shimoji,Shigeto Dobata,Hiroyuki Shimoji,Shigeto Dobata","Reproductive division of labour is a hallmark of eusocial insects. However, its stability can often be hampered by the potential for reproduction by otherwise sterile nest-mates. Dominance hierarchy has a crucial role in some species in regulating which individuals reproduce. Compared with those in vertebrates, the dominance hierarchies in eusocial insects tend to involve many more individuals, and should require additional selective forces unique to them. Here, we provide an overview of a series of studies on dominance hierarchies in eusocial insects. Although reported from diverse eusocial taxa, dominance hierarchies have been extensively studied in paper wasps and ponerine ants. Starting from molecular physiological attributes of individuals, we describe how the emergence of dominance hierarchies can be understood as a kind of self-organizing process through individual memory and local behavioural interactions. The resulting global structures can be captured by using network analyses. Lastly, we argue the adaptive significance of dominance hierarchies from the standpoint of sterile subordinates. Kin selection, underpinned by relatedness between nest-mates, is key to the subordinates' acceptance of their positions in the hierarchies. This article is part of the theme issue 'The centennial of the pecking order: current state and future prospects for the study of dominance hierarchies'."

Various probiotic bacteria have been used in animal and human. However, Saccharomyces boulardii is the only yeast currently used in humans as probiotic. There is scarce research conducted on yeast species commonly found in kefir despite its claimed potential preventative and curative effects. This work focused on adhesion properties, and antibacterial metabolites produced by Kluyveromyces lactis and Saccharomyces unisporus isolated from traditional kefir grains compared to Saccharomyces boulardii strains. Adhesion and sedimentation assay, slide agglutination, microscopy and turbidimetry assay were used to analyze adhesion of Salmonella Arizonae and Salmonella Typhimurium onto yeast cells. Salmonella growth inhibition due to the antimicrobial metabolites produced by yeasts in killer toxin medium was analyzed by slab on the lawn, turbidimetry, tube dilution and solid agar plating assays. Alcohol and antimicrobial proteins production by yeasts in killer toxin medium were analyzed using gas chromatography and shotgun proteomics, respectively. Salmonella adhered onto viable and non-viable yeast isolates cell wall. Adhesion was visualized using scanning electron microscope. Yeasts-fermented killer toxin medium showed Salmonella growth inhibition. The highest alcohol concentration detected was 1.55%, and proteins with known antimicrobial properties including cathelicidin, xanthine dehydrogenase, mucin-1, lactadherin, lactoperoxidase, serum amyloid A protein and lactotransferrin were detected in yeasts fermented killer medium. These proteins are suggested to be responsible for the observed growth inhibition effect of yeasts-fermented killer toxin medium. Kluyveromyces lactis and Saccharomyces unisporus have anti-salmonella effect comparable to Saccharomyces boulardii strains, and therefore have potential to control Salmonella infection."

Calcium supplementation during pregnancy is known to reduce the risk of these disorders and associated complications, including preeclampsia, maternal morbidity, and preterm birth, and is, therefore, a recommended intervention for pregnant women in populations with low dietary calcium intake (e.g., where ≥25% of individuals in the population have intakes less than 800 mg calcium/day). However, this intervention is not widely implemented in part due to cost and logistical issues related to the large dose and burdensome dosing schedule (three to four 500-mg doses/day). WHO recommends 1.5-2 g/day but limited evidence suggests that less than 1 g/day may be sufficient and ongoing trials with low-dose calcium supplementation (500 mg/day) may point a path toward simplifying supplementation regimens. Calcium carbonate is likely to be the most cost-effective choice, and it is not necessary to counsel women to take calcium supplements separately from iron-containing supplements. In populations at highest risk for preeclampsia, a combination of calcium supplementation and food-based approaches, such as food fortification with calcium, may be required to improve calcium intakes before pregnancy and in early gestation."
596,Enhanced lung image segmentation using deep learning,"Shilpa Gite,Abhinav Mishra,Ketan Kotecha,Shilpa Gite,Abhinav Mishra,Ketan Kotecha","With the advances in technology, assistive medical systems are emerging with rapid growth and helping healthcare professionals. The proactive diagnosis of diseases with artificial intelligence (AI) and its aligned technologies has been an exciting research area in the last decade. Doctors usually detect tuberculosis (TB) by checking the lungs' X-rays. Classification using deep learning algorithms is successfully able to achieve accuracy almost similar to a doctor in detecting TB. It is found that the probability of detecting TB increases if classification algorithms are implemented on segmented lungs instead of the whole X-ray. The paper's novelty lies in detailed analysis and discussion of U-Net + + results and implementation of U-Net + + in lung segmentation using X-ray. A thorough comparison of U-Net + + with three other benchmark segmentation architectures and segmentation in diagnosing TB or other pulmonary lung diseases is also made in this paper. To the best of our knowledge, no prior research tried to implement U-Net + + for lung segmentation. Most of the papers did not even use segmentation before classification, which causes data leakage. Very few used segmentations before classification, but they only used U-Net, which U-Net + + can easily replace because accuracy and mean_iou of U-Net + + are greater than U-Net accuracy and mean_iou , discussed in results, which can minimize data leakage. The authors achieved more than 98% lung segmentation accuracy and mean_iou 0.95 using U-Net + + , and the efficacy of such comparative analysis is validated."

598,Evaluation of rheological behaviors and anti-aging properties of recycled asphalts using low-viscosity asphalt and polymers,"Ren, Shisong; Liu, Xueyan; Wang, Haopeng; Fan, Weiyu; Erkens, Sandra","Recycling technology is widely used in the asphalt road construction due to its environmental and economic effects. Many efforts have focused on the performance restoration of aged base asphalt by adding light oil, but the possibility of recycling the aged asphalt using low-viscosity asphalt and polymers has been few explored. Therefore, the objective of this research is to use polymer-modified low-viscosity asphalt as rejuvenator to recycle the aged asphalt. The conventional properties, rheological behaviors as well as anti-aging performance of polymer-modified recycled asphalts were evaluated by rotational viscosity (RV) tests, dynamic shear rheometer (DSR) tests and bending beam rheometer (BBR) tests. Moreover, the effects of the concentration ratio between polymer-modified low-viscosity asphalt reju-venator and aged asphalt on the high-temperature anti-rutting, low-temperature cracking resistance, fatigue and aging resistance abilities of recycled asphalt were studied. The results show that the low-viscosity asphalt can increase viscous components and restore the workability of aged asphalt. However, the addition of low-viscosity asphalt weakens the high-temperature properties, temperature sensitivity and anti-aging performance of aged asphalt. Fortunately, the high-temperature rutting resistance, temperature sensitivity, viscoelastic properties, low-temperature cracking resistance, anti-fatigue and aging resistance performance of recycled asphalt can be enhanced remarkably by adding SBS and CR. Meanwhile, SBS-modified recycled asphalt has better fatigue and low temperature cracking resistance properties, while CR-modified recycled asphalt has the advantages on the rutting resistance, anti-aging and temperature sensitivity performance. Furthermore, SBS5-5 and CR6-4 modified recycled asphalts both have better pavement performance than others, which is superior to the requirements of polymer modified asphalt. Therefore, it is meaningful and feasible to recycle the aged base asphalt to be polymer-modified asphalt. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."

Immunotherapy uses different immunological approaches to stimulate the immune system to identify tumor cells for targeted elimination. Phototherapy destroys the primary tumors by light irradiation, which induces a series of immune responses through triggering immunogenic cancer cell death. Therefore, when integrating immunotherapy with phototherapy, a novel anti-cancer strategy called photoimmunotherapy (PIT) is emerging. This synergistic treatment modality can not only enhance the effectiveness of both therapies but also overcome their inherent limitations, opening a new era for the current anti-cancer therapy. Recently, the advancement of nanomaterials affords a platform for PIT. From all these nanomaterials, inorganic nanomaterials stand out as ideal mediators in PIT due to their unique physiochemical properties. Inorganic nanomaterials can not only serve as carriers to transport immunomodulatory agents in immunotherapy owing to their excellent drug-loading capacity but also function as photothermal agents or photosensitizers in phototherapy because of their great optical characteristics. In this review, the recent advances of multifunctional inorganic nanomaterial-mediated drug delivery and their contributions to cancer PIT will be highlighted."

Eighty of the sheep, weight of (45.56 ± 2.35) kg, were randomly distributed to the tested areas for 90 days, 20 sheep/group. The findings showed that the contents of Mo and N in the forage of applying nano-K2MoO4 were extremely higher than those in the control pastures (P <0.01). The daily gain in the fertilized groups were remarkably lower than that in the control group (P <0.01). The harvest of forage in the fertilized pastures were significantly higher than those in control (P <0.01). The contents of Mo in blood and liver in grazing the Chinese merino sheep were extremely higher than those from the control group (P <0.01). The contents of Cu in blood and liver in grazing the Chinese merino sheep were extremely lower than those in the unfertilized pastures (P <0.01). The levels of hemoglobin (Hb), blood platelet (PLT), and erythrocyte count (RBC) in animals from the fertilized pastures were extremely lower than those in the control pastures (P < 0.01). The activities of SOD, GSH-Px, and CAT in serum were significantly lower than those in group C. The serum MDA levels were significantly higher than those in the control group (P < 0.01). In conclusion, the application of nano-K2MoO4 in pastures can greatly improve the yield of forage, but strikingly decreased the daily gain and antioxidant function in grazing the Chinese merino sheep."

Changes in ecological conditions and processes due to temperature and precipitation fluctuations and intensified disturbance regimes are affecting infectious pathogen transmission, habitat, hosts, and the characteristics of pathogens themselves. Understanding the relationships between climate change and infectious diseases can help clinicians broaden the scope of differential diagnoses when interviewing, diagnosing, and treating patients presenting with infections lacking obvious agents or transmission pathways. Here, we highlight key examples of how the mechanisms of climate change affect infectious diseases associated with water, fire, land, insects, and human transmission pathways in the hope of expanding the analytical framework for infectious disease diagnoses. Increased awareness of these relationships can help prepare both clinical physicians and epidemiologists for continued impacts of climate change on infectious disease in the future."
602,A bi-level market-clearing for coordinated regional-local multi-carrier systems in presence of energy storage technologies,"Nasiri, Nima; Yazdankhah, Ahmad Sadeghi; Mirzaei, Mohammad Amin; Loni, Abdolah; Mohammadi-Ivatloo, Behnam; Zare, Kazem; Marzband, Mousa","A multi-energy system (MES) provides greater flexibility for the operation of different energy carriers. It increases the reliability and efficiency of the networks in the presence of renewable energy sources (RESs). Various energy carriers such as power, gas, and heat can be interconnected by energy storage systems (ES5s) and combined heat and power units at different levels (e.g., within a region or a local). Non-coordinated optimization of energy systems at local and regional levels does not verify the whole optimal operation of systems since the systems are operated without considering their interactions with each other. One of the most famous sources of flexibility is E55s. Hence, this paper presents a stochastic decentralized approach to evaluate the impact of ESSs on regional-local MES market-clearing within a bi-level framework. On the regional level, the economic interaction between the electricity and natural gas (NG) systems is carried out by a centralized system operator (CSO). In addition, coordination between various energy carriers is implemented by the energy hub operator at the local level. To ameliorate the flexibility of the NG system in the regional MES, the linepack model of gas pipelines has been considered. Local MES modeling is performed through multiple input/output ports using a linear energy hub model. The proposed model is a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP), which is solved by CPLEX solver in GAMS software."
603,"Governance, CO2 emissions and inclusive human development in sub-Saharan Africa","Asongu, Simplice A.; Odhiambo, Nicholas M.","This study investigates the relevance of government quality in moderating the incidence of environmental degradation on inclusive human development in 44 sub-Saharan African countries for the period 2000-2012. Environmental degradation is measured with CO2 emissions and the governance dynamics include: political stability, voice and accountability, government effectiveness, regulation quality, the rule of law and corruption-control. The empirical evidence is based on the generalised method of moments. Regulation quality modulates CO2 emissions to exert a net negative effect on inclusive development. Institutional governance (consisting of corruption-control and the rule of law) modulates CO2 emissions to also exert a net negative effect on inclusive human development. Fortunately, the corresponding interactive effects are positive, which indicates that good governance needs to be enhanced to achieve positive net effects. A policy threshold of institutional governance at which institutional governance completely dampens the unfavourable effect of CO2 emissions on inclusive human development is established. Other policy implications are discussed."
604,Forecasting carbon futures price: a hybrid method incorporating fuzzy entropy and extreme learning machine,"Peng Chen,Andrew Vivian,Cheng Ye,Peng Chen,Andrew Vivian,Cheng Ye","In this paper, we propose a novel hybrid model that extends prior work involving ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) by using fuzzy entropy and extreme learning machine (ELM) methods. We demonstrate this 3-stage model by applying it to forecast carbon futures prices which are characterized by chaos and complexity. First, we employ the EEMD method to decompose carbon futures prices into a couple of intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) and one residue. Second, the fuzzy entropy and K-means clustering methods are used to reconstruct the IMFs and the residue to obtain three reconstructed components, specifically a high frequency series, a low frequency series, and a trend series. Third, the ARMA model is implemented for the stationary high and low frequency series, while the extreme learning machine (ELM) model is utilized for the non-stationary trend series. Finally, all the component forecasts are aggregated to form final forecasts of the carbon price for each model. The empirical results show that the proposed reconstruction algorithm can bring more than 40% improvement in prediction accuracy compared to the traditional fine-to-coarse reconstruction algorithm under the same forecasting framework. The hybrid forecasting model proposed in this paper also well captures the direction of the price changes, with strong and robust forecasting ability, which is significantly better than the single forecasting models and the other hybrid forecasting models."

There is still a lack of effective prevention methods in clinical practice. This study investigated the protective effect of the urinary exosomes from premature infants on cisplatin-induced acute kidney injury. Here we isolated exosomes from the fresh urine of premature infants. A C57BL/6 mice model of cisplatin-induced acute kidney injury was given 100 ug urinary exosomes 24 hours after model establishment. The kidneys were collected for pathological examination and the evaluation of renal tubular damage and apoptosis. In the in vitro experiment, human renal cortex/proximal tubular cells (HK-2) were induced by cisplatin to assess the effect of the urine exosomes from premature infants. Exosome microRNA (miRNA) sequencing technology was applied to investigate the miRNAs enriched in exosomes and the dual-luciferase gene reporter system to examine the targeting relationship of the miRNA with target genes. The results indicated that the urinary exosomes could decrease the serum creatinine level and the apoptosis of renal tubular cells, and reduce mice mortality. In addition, miR-30a-5p was the most abundant miRNA in the exosomes. It protected HK-2 cells from cisplatin-induced apoptosis by targeting and down-regulating the mitogen-activated protein kinase 8 (MAPK8). Together, our findings identified that the urinary exosomes derived from premature infants alleviated cisplatin-induced acute kidney injury and inhibited the apoptosis of HK-2 via miR-30a-5p, which could target MAPK8. These findings implied that urinary exosomes from premature infants riched in miR-30a-5p might become a potential treatment for AKI."

Despite a wealth of data from the last century of research on dominance hierarchies, these data are only rarely used for comparative insight. Here, we aim to facilitate comparative studies of the structure and function of dominance hierarchies by compiling published dominance interaction datasets from the last 100 years of work. This compiled archive includes 436 datasets from 190 studies of 367 unique groups (mean group size 13.8, s.d. = 13.4) of 135 different species, totalling over 243 000 interactions. These data are presented in an R package alongside relevant metadata and a tool for subsetting the archive based on biological or methodological criteria. In this paper, we explain how to use the archive, discuss potential limitations of the data, and reflect on best practices in publishing dominance data based on our experience in assembling this dataset. This archive will serve as an important resource for future comparative studies and will promote the development of general unifying theories of dominance in behavioural ecology that can be grounded in testing with empirical data.

608,Up-regulation of caveolin 1 mediated by chitosan activates Wnt/ β-catenin pathway in chronic refractory wound diabetic rat model,"Jie Gao,Jiayuan Zhang,Lianheng Xia,Xuewei Liang,Wukun Ding,Meiyu Song,Linggen Li,Zhen Jia,Jie Gao,Jiayuan Zhang,Lianheng Xia,Xuewei Liang,Wukun Ding,Meiyu Song,Linggen Li,Zhen Jia","Diabetes mellitus (DM) can be implicated in the perturbations of vascular integrity and the dysfunction of angiogenesis. Chitosan has the advantage of promoting the vascular endothelial cell proliferation. However, the molecular mechanism of action in the promotion of wound healing by chitosan derivatives is still debated. In the current study, DM with chronic wound (CW) model rats were prepared and treated with chitosan. Vascular endothelial cells isolated from granulation tissues were conducted by RNA sequencing. Two thousand three hundred and sixteen genes were up-regulated, while 1,864 genes were down-regulated after chitosan treatment compared to CW group. Here, we observed that caveolin 1 (CAV1) was highly expressed induced by chitosan. Furthermore, we observed that CAV1 knockdown could compromise the activation of Wnt pathway by reduction of β-catenin in rat aortic endothelial cells (RAOECs) and brain endothelium four cells (RBE4s). Moreover, we determined a direct interaction between CAV1 and β-catenin by IP assay. The C-terminus of CAV1 and β-catenin (24 to 586 amino acids) contributed to the interaction of these two proteins. Finally, the protein docking analysis indicated that the fragments of β-catenin (253-261 'FYAITTLHN' and 292-303 'KFLAITTDCLQI') might have affected the structure by CAV1 and facilitated the resistance to degradation. Taken together, our study demonstrates that chitosan can up-regulate CAV1 expression, and CAV1 can interact with β-catenin for promotion of canonical Wnt signaling pathway activity. Our results deepens the molecular mechanism of the Wnt pathway in vascular endothelial cells and is beneficial to developing new targets to assist in enhancing the pharmacological effect of chitosan on wound healing and angiogenesis against DM."
609,"Technical, economic and environmental assessement of bioethanol biorefinery from waste biomass","Demichelis, Francesca; Laghezza, Maddalena; Chiappero, Marco; Fiore, Silvia","This study presents a sequential three-steps methodology for the technical, economic and environmental assessment (TEEA) of bioethanol production from waste biomass. In EU the most abundant waste biomasses produced in 2018 could be ascribed to three main categories: lignocellulosic (329.41 Mt), starch (160 Mt) and sugar-based (58.56 Mt). The technical assessment compiled an inventory of the waste biomasses and subsequently designed their biological conversion into ethanol through integrated biorefinery processes by means of material flow analysis (MFA); the economic assessment was aimed at the definition of the cut-off size of the biorefinery plant necessary to achieve profitability; the environmental assessment was based on Life Cycle Analysis (LCA) and energy balance (i.e. energy input consumption). For each of the three waste biomass categories, at least one that was significant as available amount and representative in terms of physico-chemical characteristics, was evaluated: sugarcane for sugar-based, potatoes for starch-based and rice straw, cattle manure and organic fraction of municipal solid waste (OFMSW) for lignocellulosic biomasses. The technical assessment of the biorefinery routes lead to the following yields (kg of bioethanol per kg of biomass): 0.16, 0.17, 0.22, 0.19 and 0.14 respectively. The economic profitability was reached by all biorefineries and Net Present Value (MV) were: 0.85 for sugarcane, 0.11 for potatoes, 0.09 for rice straw, 0.11 for cattle manure and 0.39 for OFMSW. From the environmental perspective, cattle manure reached the highest reduction of climate change and acidification impacts compared to other biomasses, while sugarcane achieved the lowest energy input consumption (around 64%).

The effect of five independent factors including drying temperature (40-60 °C), methanol concentration (20-60%), extraction temperature (28-60 °C), extraction time (30-60 min) and storage duration (0-14 days) were evaluated. Among all the examined factors, results showed that drying temperature, storage duration and extraction temperature were the most significant and contributing factors affecting the total polyphenols, phenolic acids and flavonoids content of lemon peel at P < 0.05. On the contrary, methanol concentration and extraction time exhibited the least significant and contribution at P greater than 0.05. In conclusion, the experimental domain factors were successfully obtained from this experiment, Therefore, further study on optimization of the obtained factors will be conducted in the future study using response surface methodology."
611,Development of wind energy market in the European Union,"Borawski, Piotr; Beldycka-Borawska, Aneta; Jankowski, Krzysztof Jozef; Dubis, Bogdan; Dunn, James W.","Renewable energy sources (RES) can play a significant role in economic growth. This article examines the development of the wind energy market in the EU. The applicable regulations, directives, and legal acts are reviewed, and the State's role in the development of the renewable energy market is discussed. The analyses were carried out based on the available literature and Eurostat data. The authors of the paper used basic statistics to summarize the changes in wind energy and make a prognosis. The data analysis uses the Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average Method (ARIMA). The survey found that the highest average wind cumulative installed capacities were in Germany (31026 MW), Spain (18602 MW), United Kingdom (7894 MW) and France (6108 MW). Our analysis indicates that the biggest average annual installed wind capacity was in Germany (2952.6 MW), Spain (1224.5 MW) and the United Kingdom (1363.8 MW). These same countries achieved the highest average wind gross electricity production in the years 2004-17: Germany (50.9 TWh), Spain (39.3 TWh) and United Kingdom (18.9 TWh). The study finds that wind cumulative installed capacity will increase in most countries of the EU. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."

This issue has been mainly attributed to land-use and land-cover changes, in particular related to agricultural expansion and intensification. In this study, we used the DPSIR framework (D: driving forces, P: pressures, S: states, I: impacts, and R: responses) to systematically describe the ecosystem service dynamics related to anthropogenic activities and climatic parameters in the region. We reviewed the literature and used remote sensing, agricultural, climatic and hydrological data together with expert knowledge to assess the main driving forces and pressures, resulting land-use transitions and their spatiotemporal impacts on ecosystem services and biodiversity using a matrix-based assessment approach. We identified population growth, economic incentives and climate change as the most important driving forces, leading to altered agricultural activities, numerous dam constructions and droughts. Since 1987 cropland areas doubled at the expense of bare soils and natural vegetation, the lake halt lost more than half of its surface area, urban and freshwater areas increased threefold and by 50%, respectively. This favored crop and freshwater provision, while all other ecosystem services remained nearly constant or decreased, though spatial patterns were heterogeneous. For example, regulating and cultural services, and biodiversity mainly decreased at the shorelines of the lake, while provisioning services increased along the major rivers and close to cities. To address the land-use transitions with the most profound impact on ecosystem service provision, we recommend the following measures: increase the water supply to the lake, reduce cropland expansion, manage existing croplands more sustainably and protect natural vegetation. Our study provides a comprehensive overview of the regional ecosystem service dynamics and a valuable baseline for future research and environmental management in the basin. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

613,Between Justice and Money: How the Covid-19 Crisis was used to De-Differentiate Legality in Ecuador,"Katiuska King,Philipp Altmann,Katiuska King,Philipp Altmann","Legality in the Global South suffers from problems of application by convenience. Some rules are applied, and some are not, depending on certain actors, such as the State, the stakeholders, or others. This undermines legitimation as constructed by legality and due process. These problems are connected to a wider complex formed by coloniality, internal colonialism, and a form of functional differentiation that limits autonomy of the different social systems. This complex of structural properties allows States and other actors to systematically use one system against the other or-within a given system-one level of rules against the other. This was the case in Ecuador: in the initial months of quarantine due to Covid-19, the government took decisions about external state bonds following international legislation-and quite contrary ones related to local work contracts. Once again, legality followed different paths in diverse cases. Ecuadorian economic authorities accept and respect conditions on external public bonds which are protected by some complex and specific clauses to secure the payment. The same authorities have different practices towards international and national legislation that were organized in the sense of legal subsidiarity. This text will explore reasons and effects of legal de-differentiation in the Global South in times of crisis. The Ecuadorian case in time of Covid-19 helps to understand how structural problems related to the lack of autonomy of the legal system are perpetuated and lead to effects of convenient political action."
614,Multi-objective techno-economic-environmental optimisation of electric vehicle for energy services,"Das, Ridoy; Wang, Yue; Putrus, Ghanim; Kotter, Richard; Marzband, Mousa; Herteleer, Bert; Warmerdam, Jos","Electric vehicles and renewable energy sources are collectively being developed as a synergetic implementation for smart grids. In this context, smart charging of electric vehicles and vehicle-to-grid technologies are seen as a way forward to achieve economic, technical and environmental benefits. The implementation of these technologies requires the cooperation of the end-electricity user, the electric vehicle owner, the system operator and policy makers. These stakeholders pursue different and sometime conflicting objectives. In this paper, the concept of multi-objective-techno-economic-environmental optimisation is proposed for scheduling electric vehicle charging/discharging. End user energy cost, battery degradation, grid interaction and CO2 emissions in the home micro-grid context are modelled and concurrently optimised for the first time while providing frequency regulation. The results from three case studies show that the proposed method reduces the energy cost, battery degradation, CO2 emissions and grid utilisation by 88.2%, 67%, 34% and 90% respectively, when compared to uncontrolled electric vehicle charging. Furthermore, with multiple optimal solutions, in order to achieve a 41.8% improvement in grid utilisation, the system operator needs to compensate the end electricity user and the electric vehicle owner for their incurred benefit loss of 27.34% and 9.7% respectively, to stimulate participation in energy services."

While conventional wisdom underscores the need for rigorous scientific data as a foundation before implementation, high-quality supporting evidence is frequently not available for the prehospital setting. Therefore, implementation decisions are often based upon preliminary or evolving data, or pragmatic information from clinical use. When considering novel technologies and techniques. NAEMSP recommends:Prior to implementing a novel technology or technique, a thorough assessment using the best available scientific data should be conducted on the technical details of the novel approach, as well as the potential effects on operations and outcomes.The decision and degree of effort to adopt, implement, and monitor a novel technology or technique in the prehospital setting will vary by the quality of the best available scientific and clinical information:• Routine use - Technologies and techniques with ample observational but limited or no interventional clinical trial data, or with strong supporting in-hospital data. These techniques may be reasonably adopted in the prehospital setting. This includes video laryngoscopy and bougie-assisted intubation. • Limited use - Technologies and techniques with ample pragmatic clinical use information but limited supporting scientific data. These techniques may be considered in the prehospital setting. This includes suction-assisted laryngoscopy and airway decontamination and cognitive aids. • Rare use - Technologies and techniques with minimal clinical use information. Use of these techniques should be limited in the prehospital setting until evidence exists from more stable clinical environments. This includes intubation boxes.The use of novel technologies and techniques must be accompanied by systematic collection and assessment of data for the purposes of quality improvement, including linkages to patient clinical outcomes.EMS leaders should clearly identify the pathways needed to generate high-quality supporting scientific evidence for novel technologies and techniques."
616,Can industrial agglomeration promote pollution agglomeration? Evidence from China,"Dong, Feng; Wang, Yue; Zheng, Lu; Li, Jingyun; Xie, Shouxiang","After industrial agglomeration has developed to a certain extent, its negative externality will appear gradually, and the problem of environmental pollution will become serious. In this study, a comprehensive index of pollution emission is calculated by the improved entropy method, and the pollution agglomeration level is obtained through the geographical concentration. The degree of industrial agglomeration is estimated by the location quotient index. The impact of industrial agglomeration on pollution agglomeration is investigated by using the model of Geographically and Temporally Weighted Regression (GTWR). The main results are as follows. (1) There is spatial autocorrelation between pollution agglomeration and industrial agglomeration in China. (2) At the national level, industrial agglomeration increases the pollution agglomeration. (3) At the provincial level, industrial agglomeration has a positive effect on the pollution agglomeration, but the degrees of influence in different regions are different. The positive effect in the northern region (such as Inner Mongolia, Heilongjiang, and Jilin) and the eastern region (such as Beijing, Tianjin, and Liaoning) is the strongest, whereas the effect in the western region (such as Sichuan, Guizhou, and Guangxi) is on the low side. (4) The relationship between industrial agglomeration and pollution agglomeration is relatively stable from the time perspective, and it may be hard to weaken the positive effect over a short time. To improve the environmental quality, this study puts forward some suggestions, such as optimising high-tech industrial agglomeration and strengthening the regional linkage. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

617,"Energy, exergy, environmental, and economic analysis of natural and forced cooling of solar still with porous media","Hassan, Hamdy; Yousef, Mohamed S.; Ahmed, M. Salem; Fathy, Mohamed","The performance of single slope solar still with an enhanced condenser at different saline water mediums in the basin is studied and assessed based on productivity, energy, exergy, economic, and enviroeconomic methodologies. Six solar still configurations are considered: conventional solar still (CSS); modified solar still (MSS) which is a still with heat sink condenser; MSS having an umbrella (MSS + U); MSS with forced-air cooling (MSS + FA); MSS with forced-water cooling (MSS + FW); and finally, MSS with forced-water cooling and contains sand in the basin (MSS + FW + SD). Experiments are conducted under hot and cold climate conditions of Sohag city, Egypt. The results indicate that the MSS + FW + SD has a maximum daily yield of 5.37 kg/m(2)in summer and 2.74 kg/m(2)in winter with an increase of 36% in summer and 26% in winter compared with CSS. It was found that the maximum increase of the energy and exergy efficiency compared with CSS is achieved in the case of MSS + FW + SD of 39% and 33%, respectively. Furthermore, the maximum and minimum cost of freshwater is achieved in cases of MSS + U and MSS + FW + SD, respectively. Finally, among all studied systems, MSS + FW + SD achieves the best performance based on the exergoeconomic approach."
618,The Effect on Venous Congestion of Diverting Arterial Flow in the Arterialized Venous Flap,"Yu-Te Lin,Charles Yuen Yung Loh,Shih-Heng Chen,Yu-Te Lin,Charles Yuen Yung Loh,Shih-Heng Chen","An arterialized venous flap is a cutaneous flap based solely on subcutaneous veins. The flap is perfused by nonphysiologic flow of blood from the vein into the peripheral tissue. This nonphysiologic perfusion limits the indications for an arterialized venous flap, and its postoperative complications make it an unpopular choice for reconstruction. When venous flaps are designed following the direction of venous valves (antegrade) in a flow-through fashion, the blood may bypass the peripheral tissue without perfusing the flap. A higher pressure within the efferent end of the vein impedes venous return from the peripheral tissue into this draining vein. Thus, venous congestion of the arterialized venous flap becomes inevitable. We describe our approach to designing an arterialized venous flap in which direct arteriovenous shunting is largely eliminated, thereby transmitting a higher pressure in the periphery of the flap while maintaining a physiologic venous pressure in the efferent vein. This restriction of shunting can be accomplished in a number of ways, depending on the venous pattern within the flap."
619,Vaspin attenuates steatosis-induced fibrosis via GRP78 receptor by targeting AMPK signaling pathway,"Alina Abdolahi,Zakaria Vahabzadeh,Esmael Izadpanah,Mohammad Raman Moloudi,Alina Abdolahi,Zakaria Vahabzadeh,Esmael Izadpanah,Mohammad Raman Moloudi","Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a common chronic liver disease that is rapidly becoming a public health problem. An imbalance in lipid distribution to the hepatocytes and metabolism causes hepatocyte steatosis. Vaspin is a newly discovered adipokine that has been linked to a variety of metabolic disorders. The effects of vaspin on steatosis and fibrosis pathogenesis and related mechanisms are unclear. Thus, this study investigated the molecular mechanism of vaspin on hepatocyte steatosis and fibrosis. HepG2 cells were treated with 1.2 mM free fatty acid and the intracellular lipid values were measured by flow cytometry and Nile red assay. RT-qPCR was used to assess the effect of vaspin and blocking of the GRP78 receptor on the expression of lipogenesis, oxidation, uptake, and secretion of fatty acid (FA), as well as AMPK activity. In co-cultured HepG2 and LX-2 cell lines, the expression of main proteins of hepatocyte fibrosis was analyzed using Western blot analysis. In the HepG2 cell line, we discovered that vaspin increased oxidation, FA secretion and gene expression, and AMPK activity and decreased lipogenesis and FA uptake and gene expression. Western blot analysis in co-cultured HepG2 and LX-2 cell lines showed that α-SMA and TGF-β1 protein expression decreased. The data demonstrated that vaspin acts as a novel regulator of hepatocyte steatosis through the GRP78 receptor, effectively reducing hepatocyte fibrosis through AMPK activation and decreasing NF-κB gene expression."

621,Behavioural and physiological plasticity in social hierarchies,"T M Milewski,W Lee,F A Champagne,J P Curley,T M Milewski,W Lee,F A Champagne,J P Curley","Individuals occupying dominant and subordinate positions in social hierarchies exhibit divergent behaviours, physiology and neural functioning. Dominant animals express higher levels of dominance behaviours such as aggression, territorial defence and mate-guarding. Dominants also signal their status via auditory, visual or chemical cues. Moreover, dominant animals typically increase reproductive behaviours and show enhanced spatial and social cognition as well as elevated arousal. These biobehavioural changes increase energetic demands that are met via shifting both energy intake and metabolism and are supported by coordinated changes in physiological systems including the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal and hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axes as well as altered gene expression and sensitivity of neural circuits that regulate these behaviours. Conversely, subordinate animals inhibit dominance and often reproductive behaviours and exhibit physiological changes adapted to socially stressful contexts. Phenotypic changes in both dominant and subordinate individuals may be beneficial in the short-term but lead to long-term challenges to health. Further, rapid changes in social ranks occur as dominant animals socially ascend or descend and are associated with dynamic modulations in the brain and periphery. In this paper, we provide a broad overview of how behavioural and phenotypic changes associated with social dominance and subordination are expressed in neural and physiological plasticity. This article is part of the theme issue 'The centennial of the pecking order: current state and future prospects for the study of dominance hierarchies'."
622,Safinamide protects against amyloid β (Aβ)-induced oxidative stress and cellular senescence in M17 neuronal cells,"Xunhu Gu,Ge Zhang,Zhengfang Qin,Min Yin,Weiping Chen,Yangbo Zhang,Xu Liu,Xunhu Gu,Ge Zhang,Zhengfang Qin,Min Yin,Weiping Chen,Yangbo Zhang,Xu Liu","Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that is pathologically related to oxidative stress and cellular senescence. Safinamide is one of the clinically prescribed monoamine oxidase B (MAOB) inhibitors. It has been reported to possess therapeutic potential in neurological disorders. However, the therapeutic potential of safinamide in AD is still under investigation. In this study, we explored the effect of safinamide in amyloid (Aβ)1-42 oligomers-stimulated M17 neuronal cells. We established the in vitro model with M17 cells by treating them with 1 μM Aβ1-42 oligomers with or without safinamide (100 or 200 nM). The results show that safinamide ameliorated Aβ1-42 oligomers-induced oxidative stress in M17 cells as revealed by the decreased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and reduced glutathione (GSH) content. Safinamide treatment significantly ameliorated senescence-associated-β-galactosidase (SA-β-gal)-positive cells and telomerase activity. Further, we show that safinamide treatment resulted in decreased mRNA and protein expressions of p21 and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1). Moreover, silencing of Sirtuin1 (SIRT1) abolished the effects of safinamide on the mRNA levels of p21 and PAI-1, as well as SA-β-gal-positive cells in Aβ1-42 oligomers-induced M17 cells. In conclusion, we reveal that safinamide exerted a protective function on M17 cells from Aβ1-42 oligomers induction-caused oxidative stress and cellular senescence through SIRT1 signaling. These present results provide meaningful evidence that safinamide may be medically developed for the prevention and therapy of AD."

The aim of our retrospective study was to assess the evolution of binding and neutralizing antibody concentration until 3 months after the third dose in a large cohort of solid organ transplant (SOT) patients (n = 872). At 1 month after the third dose, anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were detected by means of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay tests in 578 patients (66.3%). In a subgroup of patients, 70% (180 out of 257) had anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody concentrations ranging from 1.2 to 18 411 binding antibody units (BAU)/ml and 48.5% (115 out of 239) had a neutralizing antibodies titer that can confer clinical protection against SARS-CoV-2. Three-hundred ninety-three patients out of the 416 (94.5%) who were seropositive at month 1 and were tested at 3 months after vaccination remained seropositive. Between months 1 and 3 after vaccination, binding and neutralizing antibodies concentrations decreased significantly. The proportion of protected patients against the SARS-CoV-2 also slightly decreased. In conclusion, this study shows that although two-third of SOT develop anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies after three doses, one-third of them remain weak or non-protected. It is important to measure anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies to define the strategy that can optimize SOT protection against SARS-CoV-2."
624,Decoupling and decomposition analysis of industrial sulfur dioxide emissions from the industrial economy in 30 Chinese provinces,"Qian, Yuan; Cao, Hui; Huang, Simin","As one of the largest emitters of sulfur dioxide (SO2), China has faced increasing pressure to achieve sustainable development. This study investigates the decoupling relationship between industrial SO2 emissions and the industrial economy in China during 1996-2015. According to the decoupling results, the study period is divided into four stages: 1996-2001, 2001-2006, 2006-2010, and 2010-2015. These four stages are closely aligned with the major adjustments of the national socio-economic policies. Then, the logarithmic mean Divisia index (LMDI) decomposition method is used to analyze the driving factors of industrial SO2 emissions. The results demonstrate that the SO2 generation intensity and SO2 abatement are the major contributors to reducing industrial SO2 emissions, while the economic activity effect is the primary inhibitory factor. Moreover, the provincial results show that most provinces with weak decoupling state since 2006 are located in less developed provinces with energy-intensive industries. Besides, the economic structure and SO2 generation intensity show negative contributions to reducing industrial SO2 emissions in some of these regions. Based on the results, the attention should be focused on cleaner production to reduce industrial SO2 emissions further, and environmental policies should be tailored to local conditions."

Its indications currently differ across centers. This national retrospective cohort study aimed to describe the profile of donors with lungs transplanted after EVLP and determine the effectiveness of EVLP on lung utilization. We included brain-dead donors with at least one lung offered between 2012 and 2019 in France. Lungs transplanted without or after EVLP were compared with those that were rejected. Donor group phenotypes were determined with multiple correspondence analysis (MCA). The association between donor factors and lung transplantation was assessed with a multivariable multinomial logistic regression. MCA revealed that donors whose lungs were transplanted after EVLP had profiles similar to the donors whose lungs were declined and quite different from those of donors with lungs transplanted without EVLP. Donor predictors of graft nonuse included age ≥50 years, smoking history, PaO2 /FiO2 ratio ≤300 mmHg, abnormal chest imaging, and purulent secretions. EVLP increased utilization of lungs from donors with a smoking history, PaO2 /FiO2 ratio ≤300 mmHg, and abnormal chest imaging."
626,Common but differentiated leadership: strategies and challenges for carbon neutrality by 2050 across industrialized economies,"Schreyer, Felix; Luderer, Gunnar; Rodrigues, Renato; Pietzcker, Robert C.; Baumstark, Lavinia; Sugiyama, Masahiro; Brecha, Robert J.; Ueckerdt, Falko","Given their historic emissions and economic capability, we analyze a leadership role for representative industrialized regions (EU, US, Japan, and Australia) in the global climate mitigation effort. Using the global integrated assessment model REMIND, we systematically compare region-specific mitigation strategies and challenges of reaching domestic net-zero carbon emissions in 2050. Embarking from different emission profiles and trends, we find that all of the regions have technological options and mitigation strategies to reach carbon neutrality by 2050. Regional characteristics are mostly related to different land availability, population density and population trends: While Japan is resource limited with respect to onshore wind and solar power and has constrained options for carbon dioxide removal (CDR), their declining population significantly decreases future energy demand. In contrast, Australia and the US benefit from abundant renewable resources, but face challenges to curb industry and transport emissions given increasing populations and high per-capita energy use. In the EU, lack of social acceptance or EU-wide cooperation might endanger the ongoing transition to a renewable-based power system. CDR technologies are necessary for all regions, as residual emissions cannot be fully avoided by 2050. For Australia and the US, in particular, CDR could reduce the required transition pace, depth and costs. At the same time, this creates the risk of a carbon lock-in, if decarbonization ambition is scaled down in anticipation of CDR technologies that fail to deliver. Our results suggest that industrialized economies can benefit from cooperation based on common themes and complementary strengths. This may include trade of electricity-based fuels and materials as well as the exchange of regional experience on technology scale-up and policy implementation."
627,The impact of R&D expenditures on CO2 emissions: Evidence from sixteen OECD countries,"Petrovic, Predrag; Lobanov, Mikhail M.","This study analyzes the impact of research and development (R&D) expenditures on CO2 emissions in 16 Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries for the period between 1981 and 2014. The estimates of long-run regression models show that the expected average effect of R&D expenditures on CO2 emissions is negative. Growth of R&D investments by 1% reduces CO2 emissions by 0.09%-0.15% on average. However, estimated country-specific regressions indicate that the long-run effect of R&D expenditures on CO2 emissions can be both positive and negative, and they vary from -0.79% in Denmark to 0.52% in Belgium. In other words, in most cases, viewed from a long-term perspective, higher R&D expenditures reduce CO2 emissions, but this does not apply to about 40% of countries. In addition, the estimation of the short-run time-varying coefficient panel data models indicated that R&D impact can be positive, negative, but also neutral (insignificant) for many years. Such findings suggest a conclusion that the effect of R&D investments on CO2 emissions cannot be characterized as negative in advance, as pointed out by numerous analysis, but must be empirically estimated. The practical significance of this study is reflected in the fact that it directs decision-makers to concentrate their efforts on promoting R&D programs, such as those in the US and Germany, which are directly focused on reducing CO2 emissions and increasing the use thereof.

One major problem is the lacking compatibility between different techno-economic assessments, such that recommendations regarding the most promising Power-to-Fuel technology are difficult to make. This work provides a technically sound comparison of various Power-to-Fuel options regarding technological maturity and efficiency, as well as cost. The investigated options include methanol, ethanol, butanol, octanol, DME, OME3-5 and hydrocarbons. To guarantee the comparability, all necessary chemical plants were designed in Aspen Plus (R) to determine material and energy consumption, as well as investment costs within the same boundary conditions and assumptions in all simulations and calculations. Individual technical aspects of the various synthesis routes, as well as their advantages and disadvantages, are highlighted. With an assumed electrolysis efficiency of 70% and considering the energy demand for the CO2 supply and the energy and operating material demand of the chemical plants, depending on the selected electrofuel, 30-60% of the primary energy in renewable electricity can be stored in the lower heating value of the electrofuel. In the presented results, the costs of H-2 supply are responsible for 58-83% of the total manufacturing costs and thus have the greatest potential to reduce the latter. For the base case (4.6 (sic)/kg(H2)), various electrofuels will have costs of manufacturing of between 1.85 and 3.96 (sic)/l(DE), with DME being the cheapest.

629,The importance of renewable energy consumption and FDI inflows in reducing environmental degradation: Bootstrap ARDL bound test in selected 9 countries,"Caglar, Abdullah Emre","This study examines the relationship between renewable energy consumption, non-renewable energy consumption, foreign direct investment, economic growth and carbon emissions for the nine countries (i.e., Denmark, Finland, France, India, Italy, Morocco, Norway, Portugal, Sweden) identified in the Climate Change Performance Index (CCPI) 2018 report. This study mainly aims to demonstrate the role of renewable energy consumption and foreign direct investment on CO2 emissions in countries with high scores in the CCPI using the newly developed bootstrap autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) approach. For this purpose, the unit root properties of the variables are determined by sharp and smooth structural break unit root test (SOR, Shahbaz et. al., 2018). We then conduct a bootstrap ARDL test developed by McNown et al. (2018) to investigate the existence of cointegration. We also use Granger causality based on the bootstrap ARDL approach to identify causal relationships between variables. Empirical analysis results show only a few cointegration relationships between variables exist. However, we have identified significant long-term relationships between foreign direct investment, renewable energy consumption and economic growth in some countries, and our study includes important policy implications, particularly for relationship among CO2 emissions and foreign direct investment inflows.

630,Emergence of size-structured dominance hierarchies through size-dependent feedback,"Ian M Hamilton,Macie D Benincasa,Ian M Hamilton,Macie D Benincasa","Size-based dominance hierarchies influence fitness, group size and population dynamics and link dominance structure to evolutionary and ecological outcomes. While larger individuals often gain dominance, social status may influence growth and size in return, resulting in feedbacks among status, growth and size. Here, we present two models evaluating how these feedbacks influence the emergence of size structure in a dominance hierarchy. In the first, size influences competition for food and investment in suppressing growth of groupmates. Stable size differences emerged when suppression was greatest for similarly sized individuals and size had little effect on competition for food. The model predicted size divergence when size strongly affected competition for food. In the second model, we used a dynamic game to solve for optimal investment in growth suppression as a function of size structure. Investment in growth suppression was favoured only when dominants and subordinates were similar in size, generating size ratios different than those expected by chance. Variation in the feedbacks among growth, size and status can explain variation in emergent size structure of dominance hierarchies and its consequences for conflict within groups. This article is part of the theme issue 'The centennial of the pecking order: current state and future prospects for the study of dominance hierarchies'."
631,After-effects of acute footshock stress on sleep states and rhythmic masticatory muscle activity during sleep in guinea pigs,"Hiroyuki Yano,Yoshio Ueno,Makoto Higashiyama,Fatema Akhter,Ayano Katagiri,Hiroki Toyoda,Narikazu Uzawa,Atsushi Yoshida,Takafumi Kato,Hiroyuki Yano,Yoshio Ueno,Makoto Higashiyama,Fatema Akhter,Ayano Katagiri,Hiroki Toyoda,Narikazu Uzawa,Atsushi Yoshida,Takafumi Kato","This study investigated the effects of acute footshock stress (FS) on the occurrence of rhythmic masticatory muscle activity (RMMA) during sleep in guinea pigs. Animals were prepared for chronic recordings from electroencephalogram, electrooculogram and electromyograms of neck and masseter muscles. The signals were recorded for six hours on the two successive days: the first day with stress-free condition (non-FS condition) and the second day with acute FS (FS condition). Sleep/wake states and RMMA were scored visually. Sleep variables and the frequency of RMMA occurring during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep were compared during 6-h periods between the two conditions. Compared to non-FS condition, the amount of total sleep and NREM sleep significantly reduced during 2 h following the acute FS in the FS condition. Similarly, the frequency of RMMA significantly increased during 2 h following the acute FS for the FS condition compared to non-FS condition. During 2-6 h after FS in the FS condition, sleep variables and the frequency of RMMA did not differ from those without FS in the non-FS condition. These results suggest that acute experimental stress can induce transient changes in sleep-wake states and the occurrence of RMMA in experimental animals."

In this study, we investigated its involvement in glioma. The expression of circABCC1 and miR-591 was detected in glioma tissues and cell lines. Gain- and loss-of-function assays were performed to determine the biological effects of circABCC1, miR-591, and high-mobility group A2 (HMGA2) in glioma cells. The circABCC1-mediated competitive endogenous RNA (ceRNA) regulatory mechanism was explored by bioinformatics and the luciferase reporter assay combined with the biotinylated RNA pulldown assay. The effect of circABCC1 on the tumorigenicity of glioma in vivo was detected by constructing xenografts in nude mice. CircABCC1 was highly expressed, and miR-591 was downregulated in glioma tissues and cells. Suppression of circABCC1 repressed the malignant behaviors of glioma cells and tumor growth. Through the ceRNA mechanism, circABCC1 interacts with miR-591 to regulate the expression of HMGA2. CircABCC1 functions as an oncogene to promote the progression of glioma via the regulation of miR-591/HMGA2 signaling. In summary, as revealed by our study, circABCC1 promotes the expression of HMGA2 via sponging of miR-591, thus affecting glioma progression as an important onco-circRNA."
633,A tale of three paradigms: Realising the revolutionary potential of ecological economics,"Spash, Clive L.","Ecological economics has ontological foundations that inform it as a paradigm both biophysically and socially. It stands in strong opposition to mainstream thought on the operations of the economy and society. The core arguments deconstruct and oppose both growth and price-making market paradigms. However, in contradiction of these theoretical foundations, ecological economists can be found who call upon neoclassical economic theory as insightful, price-making and capitalist markets as socially justified means of allocation and economic growth as achieving progress and development. The more radical steady-state and post-growth/degrowth movements are shown to include confused and conflicted stances in relation to the mainstream hegemonic paradigms. Ecological economics personally challenges those trained in mainstream theory to move beyond their orthodox education and leave behind the flawed theories and concepts that contribute to supporting systems that create social, ecological and economic crises. This paper makes explicit the paradigmatic struggle of the past thirty years and the need to wipe away mainstream apologetics, pragmatic conformity and ill-conceived postmodern pluralism. It details the core paradigmatic conflict and specifies the alternative social ecological economic paradigm along with a new research agenda."
634,Biodiversity and vector-borne diseases: Host dilution and vector amplification occur simultaneously for Amazonian leishmaniases,"Arthur Kocher,Josselin Cornuault,Jean-Charles Gantier,Sophie Manzi,Agathe Chavy,Romain Girod,Isabelle Dusfour,Pierre-Michel Forget,Marine Ginouves,Ghislaine Prévot,Jean-François Guégan,Anne-Laure Bañuls,Benoît de Thoisy,Jérôme Murienne,Arthur Kocher,Josselin Cornuault,Jean-Charles Gantier,Sophie Manzi,Agathe Chavy,Romain Girod,Isabelle Dusfour,Pierre-Michel Forget,Marine Ginouves,Ghislaine Prévot,Jean-François Guégan,Anne-Laure Bañuls,Benoît de Thoisy,Jérôme Murienne","Changes in biodiversity may impact infectious disease transmission through multiple mechanisms. We explored the impact of biodiversity changes on the transmission of Amazonian leishmaniases, a group of wild zoonoses transmitted by phlebotomine sand flies (Psychodidae), which represent an important health burden in a region where biodiversity is both rich and threatened. Using molecular analyses of sand fly pools and blood-fed dipterans, we characterized the disease system in forest sites in French Guiana undergoing different levels of human-induced disturbance. We show that the prevalence of Leishmania parasites in sand flies correlates positively with the relative abundance of mammal species known as Leishmania reservoirs. In addition, Leishmania reservoirs tend to dominate in less diverse mammal communities, in accordance with the dilution effect hypothesis. This results in a negative relationship between Leishmania prevalence and mammal diversity. On the other hand, higher mammal diversity is associated with higher sand fly density, possibly because more diverse mammal communities harbor higher biomass and more abundant feeding resources for sand flies, although more research is needed to identify the factors that shape sand fly communities. As a consequence of these antagonistic effects, decreased mammal diversity comes with an increase of parasite prevalence in sand flies, but has no detectable impact on the density of infected sand flies. These results represent additional evidence that biodiversity changes may simultaneously dilute and amplify vector-borne disease transmission through different mechanisms that need to be better understood before drawing generalities on the biodiversity-disease relationship."
635,A systematic review on active sites and functions of PIM-1 protein,"Youyi Zhao,Aziz Ur Rehman Aziz,Hangyu Zhang,Zhengyao Zhang,Na Li,Bo Liu,Youyi Zhao,Aziz Ur Rehman Aziz,Hangyu Zhang,Zhengyao Zhang,Na Li,Bo Liu","The Proviral Integration of Molony murine leukemia virus (PIM)-1 protein contributes to the solid cancers and hematologic malignancies, cell growth, proliferation, differentiation, migration, and other life activities. Many studies have related these functions to its molecular structure, subcellular localization and expression level. However, recognition of specific active sites and their effects on the activity of this constitutively active kinase is still a challenge. Based on the close relationship between its molecular structure and functional activity, this review covers the specific residues involved in the binding of ATP and different substrates in its catalytic domain. This review then elaborates on the relevant changes in protein conformation and cell functions after PIM-1 binds to different substrates. Therefore, this intensive study can improve the understanding of PIM-1-regulated signaling pathways by facilitating the discovery of its potential phosphorylation substrates."
636,Clostridioides difficile Infection in Patients with Inflammatory Bowel Disease May be Favoured by the Effects of Proinflammatory Cytokines on the Enteroglial Network,"Gabrio Bassotti,Alessandro Fruganti,Giovanni Maconi,Pierfrancesco Marconi,Katia Fettucciari,Gabrio Bassotti,Alessandro Fruganti,Giovanni Maconi,Pierfrancesco Marconi,Katia Fettucciari","Clostridioides difficile infection is widespread throughout countries and represents an important cause of nosocomial diarrhoea, with relatively high morbidity. This infection often occurs in patients with inflammatory bowel diseases and may complicate their clinical picture. Here, we propose, on the basis of evidence from basic science studies, that in patients affected by inflammatory bowel diseases, this infection might be facilitated by a derangement of the enteric glial cell (EGC) network caused by the effects of proinflammatory cytokines, such as tumour necrosis factor alpha and interferon gamma, which enhance the cytotoxic effects of C. difficile toxin B on EGCs. This hypothesis, if confirmed, could open the door to alternative treatment approaches to fight C. difficile infection."
637,Optimization and dynamic techno-economic analysis of a novel PVT-based smart building energy system,"Behzadi, Amirmohammad; Arabkoohsar, Ahmad; Yang, Yongheng","There is a variety of solar-based energy system designs for buildings. Although these systems are economically profitable, reducing the energy cost of the buildings over time, their penetration has not been that impressive yet due to their high initial cost. In this study, an energy system comprising a few PVT panels (without any batteries) and a heat storage tank is proposed and investigated for smart buildings with two-way interactions with both heat and electricity grids. Removing the battery from the system would result in a sharp reduction of the cost of the system and, thereby, will make incentives for the end-users to adopt the solution. This novel system will not only supply the buildings' real-time electricity and domestic hot water needs but also will compensate for a significant portion of the buildings' energy expenses by selling the surplus generations to the electricity and heat networks. The dynamic model of the proposed system is comprehensively analyzed from thermodynamic and economic points of view using TRNSYS software. Additionally, defining the overall annual exergy efficiency, and the total product cost as the objective functions, optimization of the design and size of the system employing the TRNOPT tool has been done. It is shown that the optimized system results in 16.7 (sic)/MWh and 7.7 (sic)/MWh lower energy costs for electricity and heat of the buildings compared to when the buildings' demand is only supplied by heat and electricity grids."

The current NSCLS therapies are associated with poor outcomes and need further improvement. CircRNAs were shown to regulate NSCLC progression. However, little is known re garding the functions and mechanisms of circ_0017639 in NSCLC, which requires further extensive studies. The circ_0017639 expression in NSCLC tissues and cell lines was evaluated via qRT-RCR. Moreover, using ectopic plasmid incorporation and shRNA assays, we analyzed the circ_0017639-mediated cellular proliferative, migratory and invasive processes in NSCLC cell lines, using CCK-8, EdU, and transwell assays. Furthermore, the core proteins (p-PI3K, PI3K, p-AKT, and AKT) levels of the PI3K/AKT signaling cascade were investigated via immunoblotting. Finally, we tested the functional role of circ_0017639 by examining its regulation of xenograft tumor growths in nude mice in vivo. Circ_0017639 expression was remarkably high in the NSCLC tissues and cell lines. The transfection experiments showed that circ_0017639 overexpression was able to promote proliferative, migratory, and invasive properties of NSCLC cells, while sh-circ_0017639 showed opposing effects. We further showed that circ_0017639 knockdown suppressed the cellular development via PI3K/AKT cascade inactivation. Additionally, in-vivo experiment in nude mice demonstrated that sh-circ_0017639 could reduce the tumor growth of NSCLC. Circ_0017639 may promote the development of NSCLC by accelerating NSCLC metastasis through stimulating the PI3K/AKT cascade."
639,Sinonasal Plasmablastic Lymphoma Arising in the Setting of Recurrent Nasal Polyposis in an Immunocompetent Individual,"Marco DiBlasi,Christopher Jayne,Reilly McNamara,Catherine Iasiello,Daryl Colden,Marco DiBlasi,Christopher Jayne,Reilly McNamara,Catherine Iasiello,Daryl Colden","Plasmablastic lymphoma (PBL) is an aggressive, rare variant of B-cell lymphoma typically associated with human immunodeficiency virus and other immunocompromised populations. Most commonly found in the oral cavity, PBL can occasionally originate in the sinonasal tract. Diagnosis of PBL is difficult due to overlapping features with other malignancies; however, early detection and treatment are imperative given its aggressive clinical course. When in the sinonasal tract, the diagnostic process can be further complicated if the patient has a history of recurrent nasal polyposis. Described is the case of a 57-year-old immunocompetent male who initially presented with benign nasal polyposis, only to return a year after sinus surgery with a unilateral sinonasal mass consistent with PBL. As literature has yet to characterize this phenomenon, this article presents the first case reported of sinonasal PBL arising in the setting of recurrent nasal polyposis. This case emphasizes the importance of investigating sinonasal masses showing laterality, maintaining a high index of suspicion for malignancy, and keeping close surveillance of the patient after treatment of PBL."
640,A selective disassembly multi-objective optimization approach for adaptive reuse of building components,"Sanchez, Benjamin; Rausch, Christopher; Haas, Carl; Saari, Rebecca","Adaptive reuse of buildings plays a key role in the transition from a resource-based economy and towards a Circular Economy (CE) in the construction industry. Adaptive reuse has the potential to maximize the residual utility and value of existing assets through green design methods such as selective disassembly planning. Studies in the field of selective disassembly are scarce and there is no evidence of established methodologies for the optimization of the environmental and financial benefits. A multi-objective analysis is key to obtaining several effective selective disassembly plans for the adaptive reuse of an existing asset through the combination of different deconstruction methods. The analysis is carried out in terms of the physical, environmental, and economic constraints of the deconstruction methods per building component. The Sequential Disassembly Planning for Buildings (SDPB) method is used in order to generate the optimized disassembly plans for retrieving target components. At the end, a weighted multi-objective optimization analysis is incorporated to generate the set of noninferior solutions that minimizes environmental impacts and building cost. The results show that different complete disassembly plans exist for all the possible combinations. The possible combinations are driven by the deconstruction methods per component, as well as the dismantling interdependence. The method described in this study can be used to improve the project outcomes according to specific goals and constraints (e.g. environmental, economic, technical). The results of this study improve the decision-making process for adaptive reuse building projects by adding comprehensive quantitative analysis towards sustainable management and conservation of resources."
641,"Dynamical analysis of coronavirus disease with crowding effect, and vaccination: a study of third strain","Ali Raza,Muhammad Rafiq,Jan Awrejcewicz,Nauman Ahmed,Muhammad Mohsin,Ali Raza,Muhammad Rafiq,Jan Awrejcewicz,Nauman Ahmed,Muhammad Mohsin","Countries affected by the coronavirus epidemic have reported many infected cases and deaths based on world health statistics. The crowding factor, which we named ""crowding effects,"" plays a significant role in spreading the diseases. However, the introduction of vaccines marks a turning point in the rate of spread of coronavirus infections. Modeling both effects is vastly essential as it directly impacts the overall population of the studied region. To determine the peak of the infection curve by considering the third strain, we develop a mathematical model (susceptible-infected-vaccinated-recovered) with reported cases from August 01, 2021, till August 29, 2021. The nonlinear incidence rate with the inclusion of both effects is the best approach to analyze the dynamics. The model's positivity, boundedness, existence, uniqueness, and stability (local and global) are addressed with the help of a reproduction number. In addition, the strength number and second derivative Lyapunov analysis are examined, and the model was found to be asymptotically stable. The suggested parameters efficiently control the active cases of the third strain in Pakistan. It was shown that a systematic vaccination program regulates the infection rate. However, the crowding effect reduces the impact of vaccination. The present results show that the model can be applied to other countries' data to predict the infection rate."
642,Removal of heavy metals from wastewater using agricultural byproducts,"Alalwan, Hayder A.; Kadhom, Mohammed A.; Alminshid, Alaa H.","The use of agricultural waste to remove heavy metals from wastewater has attracted much attention due to its economic advantages and high removal efficiency which is attributed to different functional groups. The sorption mechanism of biomass can consist of several steps including chemisorption, complexation, adsorption on surface, diffusion through pores, and ion exchange. Heavy metals were removed in different rates depending on the adsorbent and metal itself. For instance, coconut waste showed adsorption capacities of 263 and 285 mg/g in removing lead and cadmium ions, respectively. Also, black oak bark has adsorbed mercury in an adsorption capacity of 400 mg/g, while wheat brans adsorption capacity for chromium was 310 mg/g. The adsorption capacity is commonly calculated by Lagergren's first-order equation, the Redlich Peterson model, and the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) model. However, Langmuir and Freundlich models were intensively used to calculate the adsorbed amount by a unit weight of solid sorbents. This review article aims to present the recently available information on utilizing the biomass materials for heavy metals removal. Here, we highlight the increasing use of these materials due to their low cost, regeneration ability, high adsorption efficiency, and small chemical or biological sludge with a possibility of metal recovery."
643,Distributed energy systems as common goods: Socio-political acceptance of renewables in intelligent microgrids,"Wolsink, Maarten","The future social-technical system (STS) of power supply based on renewables depends heavily upon the rapid emergence of Distributed Energy Systems (DES). The prime object of Social Acceptance processes of renewable energy innovation becomes the issue of how to incorporate DES. The realization of this transformation requires the escape from locked-in hierarchy and standardized design of the centralized grid. This review elaborates the advanced conceptualization of Social Acceptance, particularly its socio-political layer. High diffusion of DES in intelligent microgrids leads to polycentricity replacing hierarchy. Therefore, the main object of 'socio-political acceptance' concerns institutional changes replacing hierarchy by co-production within STSs applying DES. Renewables become 'common goods' in such systems, instead of 'private' or 'public' goods. Systems providing 'common goods' like renewables -that are natural resources-show similarities to socialecological systems, the self-governing entities in common pool resources theory. Application of this institutional theory to co-production in DES leads to the following conclusions on socio-political acceptance. Renewables generation, integration, storage, intelligence and demand response require a shift towards co-producing prosumers. Electricity as an economic good must be redefined from commercial private commodity delivered in a public grid towards a co-produced common good. Essential for common prosumer-based DES is the application of peer-to-peer deliverance (P2P). Policy must avoid to interfere in this and also should remove legal obstructions and transaction costs for P2P and coproduction. As space is the prime scarcity factor for DES, prosumers' communities should also be empowered in co-producing land use decisions for construction of their DES infrastructures."
644,Comparative study on asphalt pavement rut based on analytical models and test data,"Yang, Lin; Hu, Yunze; Zhang, Haitao","Asphalt pavement rut influences the durability of the pavement as well as traffic safety. The influence of a flexible and a semi-rigid base on asphalt pavement rut has not been researched in detail. Using theoretical and experimental research on asphalt pavement rut, the objective of this project is to determine the differences in asphalt pavement rut for different base types and the influence of the base on the pavement's performance. The research details include an analysis of asphalt pavement rut for different base conditions using ABAQUS FEA software, an indoor rut test, and actual engineering data. For rut of asphalt surface and base(Surface and base rut means the total deformation of asphalt surface layer and base.), semi-rigid base asphalt pavement is less than flexible base asphalt pavement, but for rut of surface(Rut of surface means the deformation of asphalt surface), flexible base asphalt pavement is less than semi-rigid base asphalt pavement. This demonstrates a greater durability of asphalt pavement with a flexible base compared to a semi-rigid base. The research results provide reference values for asphalt pavement design and the described applications have economic and social benefits."

Select investigations are therefore critical for identifying patients with advanced liver disease and cirrhosis Biomarkers and validated serum tests can evaluate liver damage and synthetic function. The ratio of the concentration of aspartate aminotransferase to the platelet count can predict the presence of cirrhosis Non-invasive imaging techniques, from basic ultrasound to elastography, are critical adjuncts to the clinical assessment of cirrhosis. They reduce the need for liver biopsy Careful monitoring, prescribing and appropriate specialist referral are key considerations in cirrhosis management. Early diagnosis can help to improve the outcomes for patients."
646,A novel energy-economic-environmental multi-criteria decision-making in the optimization of a hybrid renewable system,"Mazzeo, Domenico; Baglivo, Cristina; Matera, Nicoletta; Congedo, Paolo M.; Oliveti, Giuseppe","The development of hybrid renewable systems is an economically competitive solution to reach energy decarbonization and reduction of greenhouse gasses. Based on the literature, energy, economic and environmental indicators were rarely simultaneously employed in the optimization of a hybrid renewable system. In addition, there is no procedures or a set of indicators to be applied uniformly in all applications for the shared analysis. The paper presents a novel energy-economic-environmental multi-criteria decision-making in the optimization of a hybrid renewable system, based on a new set of dimensionless indicators, proposed as a standard for future applications. The procedure compares the entire PV-wind-battery system configuration with the PV-wind, PV-battery and wind-battery system sub-configurations. A width parametric and multi-optimization analysis permit the identification of the most proper nominal powers of each system component. The procedure proposed was applied in a Mediterranean residential building, demonstrating that some system configurations allow complying simultaneously with at least two of the three energy objectives proposed, the cost-optimal level and the maximum reduction of emissions, for specific values of the load. The solar source was the most suitable both from energy, environmental and economic point of view, while the use of the wind source leads to a greater system operating time in the nominal power conditions. The study pointed out and quantified that, for specific loads, PV, wind and battery powers, the development of specific incentives for wind systems and of battery systems with a higher lifespan can help to make the hybrid systems more economically competitive."
647,Crosschecking teachers' perspectives on learning in a one-to-one environment with their actual classroom behavior - a longitudinal study,"Yehuda Peled,Ina Blau,Ronen Grinberg,Yehuda Peled,Ina Blau,Ronen Grinberg","One-to-one laptop initiatives have become prevalent in schools aiming to enhance active learning and assist students in developing twenty-first-century skills. This paper reports on a qualitative investigation of teachers in a junior high school in Northern Israel, who were gradually implementing one-to-one computing. The research reported in this paper is based on longitudinal data collected over a five-year period and included all of the teachers who participated in the project. We triangulated teachers' perspectives and actual behavior by employing classroom observations, followed up with semi-structured interviews. This study aims to map teachers' perspectives on changes in teaching in one-to-one computing settings, and the pedagogical strategies that they use in one-to-one classrooms. To explore the depth of change in teaching, teachers' perspectives were mapped based on the SAMR framework, while the TEUCT-TEUIT approach was employed to categorize pedagogical strategies. The findings pointed to several benefits of using a laptop for teaching, as well as classroom management problems and technological problems while teaching. Analysis of the interviews revealed four categories which appeared in the original TEUCT/ TEUCT scales, alongside three additional categories which did not appear in the original scales, and emerged bottom-up from our data. Furthermore, findings indicated that some of the categories originally included in TEUCT, should rather be included in the TEUIT scale. The findings point to a change in teaching strategies, from a more teacher-centered teaching approach to a more student-centered learning approach."
648,Residential carbon emission embedded in China's inter-provincial population migration,"Qi, Wei; Li, Guangdong","Population migration embodies virtual residential energy consumption and carbon transfer from the origin to the destination. Based on the differences of the per capita levels between the sending-out origins and arriving-in destinations, we develop a model to estimate the inter-spatial transfer flows of residential carbon emissions, broken down by rural-to-urban, rural-to-rural, urban-to-rural and urban-to-urban flows. The net value of transfer-in and transfer-out residential carbon emission contributes to the change of the whole carbon emission. Using the latest census data and energy balance sheet in 2010, China's inter-provincial residential carbon emission flows embedded in the population migration were calculated and visualized. We found that China's non-Hukou migration increased the national total residential carbon emission. The largest transfer flows were mainly from central to eastern China. The northern provinces were also distinct destinations due to the high-carbon energy structure. The regional difference of residential energy consumption structures, the unbalanced regional economic development and origin-to-destination interaction were the main influencing factors. To promote low-carbon and environment-friendly urbanization, the energy optimization policy should be enhanced in the identified regions, especially in the Beijing-Tianjin area."
649,The impact of foreign direct investment on urban PM2.5 pollution in China,"Cheng, Zhonghua; Li, Lianshui; Liu, Jun","The hypothesis of ""Pollution Heaven"" or ""Pollution Halo"" has, for some time, been one of the central issues in environmental economics. There is a controversy in the conclusions with regards to China, it thus needs further empirical testing. Based on 2003 to 2016 statistical data on 285 Chinese cities, this paper uses a dynamic spatial panel model to empirically analyze the impact of foreign direct investment (FDI) on PM2.5 pollution. The results demonstrate that urban PM2.5 pollution shows both significant global spatial autocorrelation and local spatial agglomeration effects. Overall, FDI significantly aggravates China's urban PM2.5 pollution, thus confirming the ""Pollution Heaven"" hypothesis. This effect, however, depends on the stage of urban economic development. Although FDI has no significant effect on urban PM2.5 pollution in the initial stage of industrialization, it does aggravate urban PM2.5 pollution in the midterm stage. In the later period of industrialization, FDI actually improves urban PM2.5 pollution, but the effect of this improvement is relatively weak. Furthermore, PM2.5 pollution shows significant spatial spillover and dynamic effects. It follows that both joint prevention and control and continuous efforts must be made to control PM2.5 pollution."
650,Bacterial driver-passenger model in biofilms: a new mechanism in the development of colorectal cancer,"J Xing,Y Fang,W Zhang,H Zhang,D Tang,D Wang,J Xing,Y Fang,W Zhang,H Zhang,D Tang,D Wang","Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a heterogeneous disease of the intestinal epithelium and ranks the third largest diagnosed malignancy in the world. Many studies have shown that the high risk of CRC is believed to be related to the formation of biofilms. To prove causation, it will be significant to decipher which specific bacteria in biofilms initiate and maintain CRC and fully describe their underlying mechanisms. Here we introduce a bacterial driver-passenger model. This model added a novel and compelling angle to the role of microorganisms, putting more emphasis on the transformation of bacterial composition in biofilms which play different roles in the development of CRC. In this model, bacterial drivers can initiate the formation of CRC through genotoxicity, while bacterial passengers maintain the CRC process through metabolites. On the basis of these pathogens, we further turned our attention to strategies that can inhibit and eradicate these pathogenic biofilms, with the aim of finding new ways to hinder colorectal carcinogenesis."
651,Effect of horticultural therapy on mental health: A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials,"Hung-Ming Tu,Hung-Ming Tu","WHAT IS KNOWN ON THE SUBJECT?: Mental health assessment is a common topic in horticultural therapy (HT). Some study findings were contrary to positive findings, although several studies have explored the effect of HT on mental health and reported positive results. There is weak evidence in the benefits of HT based on evidence-based medicine. Stronger evidence of the link between HT and mental health will help in policy making by health policy makers and governments. WHAT THE PAPER ADDS TO EXISTING KNOWLEDGE?: The purpose of this meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) was to explore the effect of HT on mental health. This study is the first meta-analysis of RCTs to provide critical evidence that HT has a positive effect on mental health. The effect size of HT on mental health was medium (0.55). The included studies had no negative effects on mental health. WHAT ARE THE IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE?: HT should be considered a useful therapy to be integrated in healthcare settings by horticultural therapists to improve mental health. In the HT program, indoor and outdoor plant activities, plant-related arts, crafts and other activities were common interventions to improve specific mental health problems through at least eight sessions. ABSTRACT: Introduction HT has been widely used to promote mental health. However, heterogeneity and sample size issues of randomized controlled trials made it challenging to illustrate effect sizes across the evidence. Aim The purpose of this meta-analysis was to explore the effect of HT on mental health. Methods We used the PRISMA framework. A keyword search of Web of Science, PubMed, ProQuest and Cochrane was performed. The inclusion criteria were HT with RCTs and mental health assessments. A random-effects model was used to perform the meta-analysis. Results A total of 1,056 records were searched, and 18 eligible studies were extracted. The included RCTs had no statistical heterogeneity and publication bias. The meta-analysis showed that the HT experimental groups had a significant and positive impact on mental health compared with the control groups (effect size = 0.55). Discussion HT should be considered for enhancing mental health. The included studies had no negative outcomes and the most common HT intervention was at least eight sessions. Therefore, HT should be considered to enhance mental health. However, the concealed allocation and blinding processes should be improved in future studies. Implications for Practice: This study recommends that HT should be integrated into healthcare settings to improve mental health."
652,Strengthening Communities: A Qualitative Assessment of Opportunities for the Prevention of Adverse Childhood Experiences in the Wake of the Opioid Crisis,"Jennifer L Matjasko,Gary Chovnick,Joivita Bradford,Sarah Treves-Kagan,Kristen Usher,Elizabeth Vaughn,Erin Ingoldsby,Jennifer L Matjasko,Gary Chovnick,Joivita Bradford,Sarah Treves-Kagan,Kristen Usher,Elizabeth Vaughn,Erin Ingoldsby","The opioid crisis is a significant challenge for health and human service systems that serve children, youth, and families across the United States. Between 2000 and 2017, the number of foster care entries, a type of adverse childhood experience (ACE), attributable to parental drug use increased by 147%. Nevertheless, there is variation in the burden of opioid overdose and foster care rates across the U.S., suggesting community supports and systems to support families affected by substance use also vary. This qualitative study sampled communities experiencing high and low rates of overdose mortality and foster care entries (i.e., a qualitative comparison group) to better understand what might protect some counties from high overdose mortality and foster care entries. The sample included six counties from three states that were selected based on their rates of opioid overdose mortality and foster care entries. Using purposive sampling within counties, interview and discussion group participants included multi-sector community partners, parents whose children had been removed due to parental substance use, and caregivers caring for children who had been removed from their homes. Across all counties, prevention was not front-of-mind. Yet, participants from communities experiencing high rates of overdose mortality and foster care entries identified several factors that might help lessen exposure to substance use and ACEs including more community-based prevention services for children and youth. Both parents and caregivers across all communities also described the need for additional supports and services. Participants also described the impact of COVID-19 on services, including greater utilization of mental health and substance use treatment services and the challenges with engaging children and youth on virtual platforms.

In recent years, nanocomposites prepared by combining clay minerals and polymers have emerged as a novel technology for cleaning contaminated water. Here, we provide an overview of various types of clay-polymer nanocomposites focusing on their synthesis processes, characteristics, and possible applications in water treatment. By evaluating various mechanisms and factors involved in the decontamination processes, we demonstrate that the nanocomposites can overcome the limitations of individual polymer and clay components such as poor specificity, pH dependence, particle size sensitivity, and low water wettability. We also discuss different regeneration and wastewater treatment options (e.g., membrane, coagulant, and barrier/columns) using clay-polymer nanocomposites. Finally, we provide an economic analysis of the use of these adsorbents and suggest future research directions."
654,A Comparison of Effectiveness of Thai Traditional Massage and Tamsulosin in Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms: A Randomized Controlled Trial,"Ongart Sinsomboon,Patranuch Noppakulsatit,Adis Tassanarong,Parunkul Tungsukruthai,Kusuma Sriyakul,Ongart Sinsomboon,Patranuch Noppakulsatit,Adis Tassanarong,Parunkul Tungsukruthai,Kusuma Sriyakul","The prospective clinical, non-inferiority study aimed to investigate the effectiveness of Thai traditional massage on lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) compared with Tamsulosin in Thai men. It was conducted on men aged 50 to 75 years old with LUTS (N = 45). Participants were blocked four randomly assigned into 2 groups. The control group (n = 25) was received 0.4 mg Tamsulosin daily and the study group (n = 20) was given Thai traditional massage for 4 weeks. The efficacy evaluation was performed by the International Prostate Symptoms Score (IPSS), a Thai version of the World Health Organization Quality of Life Questionnaire (WHO-QoL Brief), Uroflowmetry, and Post-void residual urine (PVR) at baseline and end of study. The background characteristics of participants were not significantly different between groups. Both interventions relieved LUTS in the total IPSS and the quality of life score associated with urination were decreased, described as symptoms and quality of life due to urination improvement after 4 weeks of intervention. Interestingly, the Thai traditional massage has significant improvement in total IPSS and voiding score (p < .05). Additionally, the time to peak flow rate, peak flow rate (Qmax), average flow rate (Qave) and voided volume of both interventions were improved with no statistical significance. PVR was decreased in both interventions. The WHO-QoL brief score was improved the total score. There was no significant difference in terms of uroflowmetry, PVR, and WHO-QoL brief scores compared between groups. The result suggests that Thai traditional massage has the potential to be an alternative treatment for LUTS."

656,KV7.1 channel blockade inhibits neonatal renal autoregulation triggered by a step decrease in arterial pressure,"Dieniffer Peixoto-Neves,Praghalathan Kanthakumar,Jeremiah M Afolabi,Hitesh Soni,Randal K Buddington,Adebowale Adebiyi,Dieniffer Peixoto-Neves,Praghalathan Kanthakumar,Jeremiah M Afolabi,Hitesh Soni,Randal K Buddington,Adebowale Adebiyi","KV7 channels, the voltage-gated K+ channels encoded by KCNQ genes, mediate heterogeneous vascular responses in rodents. Postnatal changes in the functional expression of KV7 channels have been reported in rodent saphenous arteries, but their physiological function in the neonatal renal vascular bed is unclear. Here, we report that, unlike adult pigs, only KCNQ1 (KV7.1) out of the five members of KCNQ genes was detected in neonatal pig renal microvessels. KCNQ1 is present in fetal pig kidneys as early as day 50 of gestation, and the level of expression remains the same up to postnatal day 21. Activation of renal vascular smooth muscle cell (SMC) KV7.1 stimulated whole cell currents, inhibited by HMR1556 (HMR), a selective KV7.1 blocker. HMR did not change the steady-state diameter of isolated renal microvessels. Similarly, intrarenal artery infusion of HMR did not alter mean arterial pressure, renal blood flow, and renal vascular resistance in the pigs. An ∼20 mmHg reduction in mean arterial pressure evoked effective autoregulation of renal blood flow, which HMR inhibited. We conclude that 1) the expression of KCNQ isoforms in porcine renal microvessels is dependent on kidney maturation, 2) KV7.1 is functionally expressed in neonatal pig renal vascular SMCs, 3) a decrease in arterial pressure up to 20 mmHg induces renal autoregulation in neonatal pigs, and 4) SMC KV7.1 does not control basal renal vascular tone but contributes to neonatal renal autoregulation triggered by a step decrease in arterial pressure.NEW & NOTEWORTHY KV7.1 is present in fetal pig kidneys as early as day 50 of gestation, and the level of expression remains the same up to postnatal day 21. KV7.1 is functionally expressed in neonatal pig renal vascular smooth muscle cells (SMCs). A decrease in arterial pressure up to 20 mmHg induces renal autoregulation in neonatal pigs. Although SMC KV7.1 does not control basal renal vascular resistance, its inhibition blunts neonatal renal autoregulation engendered by a step decrease in arterial pressure."
657,"Removal of heavy metals using a novel sulfidogenic AMD treatment system with sulfur reduction: Configuration, performance, critical parameters and economic analysis","Sun, Rongrong; Li, Yu; Lin, Nini; Ou, Chunxi; Wang, Xiaoyi; Zhang, Liang; Jiang, Feng","A novel sulfidogenic acid mine drainage (AMD) treatment system with a sulfur reduction process was developed. During the 220-d operation, > 99.9% of 380-mg/L ferric, 150-mg/L aluminum, 110-mg/L zinc, 20-mg/L copper and 2.5-mg/L lead ions, and 42.6-44.4% of 100-mg/L manganese ions in the synthetic AMD were step-by-step removed in the developed system with three pre-posed metal precipitators and a sulfur reduction reactor. Among them, zinc, copper and lead ions were removed by the biogenic hydrogen sulfide that produced through elemental sulfur reduction; while ferric, aluminum and manganese ions were removed by the alkali precipitation. Compared with the reported sulfate reduction reactors, the sulfur reduction reactor significantly reduced the chemical cost by 25.6-78.9% for sulfide production, and maintained a high sulfide production rate (1.12 g S2-/L-d). The pH level in the sulfidogenic reactor driven by sulfur-reducing bacteria posed a significant effect on the sulfide production rate. Under a nearly neutral condition (pH 7.0-7.5), elemental sulfur dissolved into polysulfide to increase the bioavailability of S-0. At acidic conditions (pH < 6.0), polysulfide formation was limited and sulfate reduction became dominant. Therefore, maintaining the sulfidogenic reactor driven by sulfur-reducing bacteria at neutral condition is essential to realize high-rate and low-cost AMD treatment. Moreover, the escape of residual hydrogen sulfide from the system was eliminated by employing a 17% recirculation from effluent to the sulfidogenic reactor."
658,Acoustic and Kinematic Correlates of Heterosyllabicity in Different Phonological Contexts,"Chiara Celata,Chiara Meluzzi,Chiara Bertini,Chiara Celata,Chiara Meluzzi,Chiara Bertini","We investigate the temporal and kinematic properties of consonant gemination and heterosyllabic clusters as opposed to singletons and tautosyllabic clusters in Italian. The data show that the singleton versus geminate contrast is conveyed by specific kinematic properties in addition to systematic durational differences in both the consonantal and vocalic intervals; by contrast, tautosyllabic and heterosyllabic clusters differ significantly for the duration of the consonantal interval but do not vary systematically with respect to the vocalic interval and cannot be consistently differentiated at the kinematic level. We conclude that systematic variations in acoustic vowel duration and the kinematics of tongue tip gestures represent the phonetic correlates of the segmental phonological contrast between short and long consonants, rather than of syllable structure. Data are only partly consistent with the predictions of both moraic and gesture-based models of the syllable about the effects of syllable structure on speech production dynamics and call for a more gradient view of syllabification."

Fifteen presumptive tenacibaculosis outbreaks distributed along the Norwegian coast during the late winter and spring of 2018 were investigated. Bacteriological culture confirmed the presence of Tenacibaculum spp. Seventy-six isolates cultured from individual fish were selected and subjected to whole-genome sequencing and MALDI-TOF MS analysis. Average nucleotide identity and MALDI-TOF analyses confirmed the presence of T. finnmarkense and T. dicentrarchi, with further division of T. finnmarkense into genomovars (gv.) finnmarkense and ulcerans. Core genome multilocus sequence typing (cgMLST) and single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analyses identified the presence of a genetically conserved cluster of gv. finnmarkense isolates against a background of relatively genetically diverse gv. finnmarkense and gv. ulcerans isolates in 13 of the 15 studied cases. This clustering strongly suggests a link between T. finnmarkense gv. finnmarkense and development of clinical tenacibaculosis in sea-farmed Norwegian salmon in the late winter and spring. Analysis of 25 Tenacibaculum isolates collected during the spring of 2019 from similar cases identified a similar distribution of genotypes. Low water temperatures were common to all cases, and most incidences involved relatively small fish shortly after sea transfer, suggesting that these fish are particularly predisposed to Tenacibaculum infection."
661,Asymmetric impact of energy consumption and economic growth on ecological footprint: Using asymmetric and nonlinear approach,"Baz, Khan; Xu, Deyi; Ali, Hashmat; Ali, Imad; Khan, Imran; Khan, Muhammad Muddassar; Cheng, Jinhua","The main objective of this article is to examine the impacts of energy consumption and economic growth on environmental quality in Pakistan. We use the ecological footprint (environmental quality) as a target variable, the control variables of gross domestic products are a proxy of economic growth, and energy consumption and gross fixed capital formation arc proxies of capital from 1971 to 2014. For this purpose, a unit root test with break dates is employed for a stationary check, and a BDS test is used for nonlinearity. The nonlinear autoregressive distributed lag approach is employed to assess the asymmetric co-integration among the variables. These results confirm the asymmetric co-integration among the variables. The asymmetric causality technique is also applied to scrutinize the causal link between the variables. The asymmetric feedback effect is observed between positive shocks to environmental quality and energy consumption, and symmetrically, environmental quality causes energy consumption. By contrast, the neutral effect is observed among environmental quality, economic growth, and capital. Based on these findings, current energy portfolios should be diversified by either enhancing or incorporating renewable energy technologies, and this is indispensable to support the existing successful strides of environmental policies. Thus, policymakers must buttress their commitments to reduce emissions by sustaining and decarbonizing the trajectory of economic growth. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."
662,Evidence-Based Considerations Exploring Relations between SARS-CoV-2 Pandemic and Air Pollution: Involvement of PM2.5-Mediated Up-Regulation of the Viral Receptor ACE-2,"Borro, Marina; Di Girolamo, Paolo; Gentile, Giovanna; De Luca, Ottavia; Preissner, Robert; Marcolongo, Adriano; Ferracuti, Stefano; Simmaco, Maurizio","The COVID-19/SARS-CoV-2 pandemic struck health, social and economic systems worldwide, and represents an open challenge for scientists -coping with the high inter-individual variability of COVID-19, and for policy makers -coping with the responsibility to understand environmental factors affecting its severity across different geographical areas. Air pollution has been warned of as a modifiable factor contributing to differential SARS-CoV-2 spread but the biological mechanisms underlying the phenomenon are still unknown. Air quality and COVID-19 epidemiological data from 110 Italian provinces were studied by correlation analysis, to evaluate the association between particulate matter (PM)(2.5)concentrations and incidence, mortality rate and case fatality risk of COVID-19 in the period 20 February-31 March 2020. Bioinformatic analysis of the DNA sequence encoding the SARS-CoV-2 cell receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) was performed to identify consensus motifs for transcription factors mediating cellular response to pollutant insult. Positive correlations between PM(2.5)levels and the incidence (r = 0.67,p< 0.0001), the mortality rate (r = 0.65,p< 0.0001) and the case fatality rate (r = 0.7,p< 0.0001) of COVID-19 were found. The bioinformatic analysis of the ACE-2 gene identified nine putative consensus motifs for the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR). Our results confirm the supposed link between air pollution and the rate and outcome of SARS-CoV-2 infection and support the hypothesis that pollution-induced over-expression of ACE-2 on human airways may favor SARS-CoV-2 infectivity."

These nanoparticles are based on CdSe/ZnS quantum dots (QDs), functionalized with N-acetylcysteine (CdSe/ZnS-A) and with a small peptide containing D-penicillamine and histidine (CdSe/ZnS-PH). CdSe/ZnS-A has tendency to aggregate and nonlinear pH sensitivity in a complex medium containing salts and macromolecules. On the contrary, CdSe/ZnS-PH shows chemical stability, low toxicity, efficient uptake in C3H10T1/2 cells, and good performance as an FLIM probe. CdSe/ZnS-PH also has key advantages over a recently reported probe based on a CdSe/ZnS QD functionalized with D-penicillamine (longer lifetimes and higher pH-sensitivity). A pH(±2σ) of 6.97 ± 0.14 was determined for C3H10T1/2 cells by FLIM employing this nanoprobe. In addition, the fluorescence lifetime signal remains nearly constant for C3H10T1/2 cells treated with CdSe/ZnS-PH for 24 h. These results show the promising applications of this nanoprobe to monitor the intracellular pH and cell state employing the FLIM technique."
664,Integrated approach for optimal techno-economic planning for high renewable energy-based isolated microgrid considering cost of energy storage and demand response strategies,"Kiptoo, Mark Kipngetich; Lotfy, Mohammed Elsayed; Adewuyi, Oludamilare Bode; Conteh, Abdul; Howlader, Abdul Motin; Senjyu, Tomonobu","To realize an efficient energy supply system for an isolated microgrid, a joint design framework that considered the capacity sizing alongside operational planning is essential. In this work, an integrated planning model was developed to investigate the techno-economic performances of a high renewable energy-based standalone microgrid. The approach combines capacity sizing and operation scheduling, considering demand-side management strategies for different system design scenarios. The evaluated scenarios involved the combination of wind turbine, photovoltaic system, diesel generator, with either battery energy storage or pumped thermal energy storage. A demand response program based on instantaneous renewable energy availability is proposed with dynamic pricing economic model for improving the overall system flexibility. Mixed-integer linear programming algorithm on MATLAB (R) is deployed as the optimization solver. The minimization of the sum of system costs which includes equivalent annual costs of the investments, running costs and costs based on demand-side management strategies is the objective function. The combination of photovoltaic, wind turbine and pumped thermal energy storage is found to be the most techno-economically efficient system configuration for the considered microgrid. More so, the proposed demand response strategy minimizes the mismatch between the generation and the load demand profile effectively, thereby increasing the system flexibility."

In this review, we aimed to clarify the diagnostic approach to patients with encephalitis of suspected autoimmune origin in order to initiate early immunotherapy, and to summarize the evidence of current immunotherapies and alternative options assessed for refractory cases. Currently, the general therapeutic approach consists of steroids, IVIG, and/or plasma exchange as first-line medications, which should be prescribed once a diagnosis of possible autoimmune encephalitis is established. For patients not responding to these treatments, rituximab and cyclophosphamide are used as second-line immunotherapy. Additionally, alternative therapies, chiefly tocilizumab and bortezomib, have been reported to be useful in particularly refractory cases. Although the aforementioned approach with first and second-line immunotherapy is widely accepted, the best therapeutic strategy is still unclear since most available evidence is gathered from retrospective non-controlled studies. Moreover, several predictors of good long-term prognosis have been proposed such as response to first-line therapies, modified Rankin score lesser than 4 at the worst neurologic status, no need for admission in intensive care unit, and early escalation to second-line immunotherapy. Thus, the lack of solid evidence underlines the necessity of future well-conducted trials addressing both the best therapeutic regimen and the outcome predictors, but since autoimmune encephalitides have a relatively low incidence, international collaborations seem imperative to reach a reasonable study population size."

We aimed to explore the Rp-Cp coupling and resistant-compliance (RC) time among them. We retrospectively reviewed catheterization data and calculated Rp and Cp in 217 subjects with ventricular septal defect. Median age and weight at catheterization were 2.8 (1.7-4.4) months and 4.3 (3.7-5.3) kg, respectively. Pulmonary hemodynamic parameters were as follows: mean pulmonary arterial pressure: 36 (28-43) mmHg; the amount of pulmonary blood flow (Qp): 14.2 (11.6-17.6) L/min/m2; Rp: 1.95 (1.38-2.59) Wood unit m2; Cp: 2.98 (2.42-3.88) mmHg/mL/m2; and RC time: 0.35 (0.30-0.40) s. RC time remained unchanged according to alterations in Qp (P = 0.206); however, the relationship between logarithm transformations of Rp and Cp showed more steeper according to an increase in Qp. The pulmonary circulation depends upon Cp rather than Rp according to the degree of Qp despite the constancy in RC time. We should take both Rp and Cp into consideration when evaluating the pulmonary circulation among children with congenital heart disease."

Despite the urgent need for new antibiotics that effectively fight against pathogenic bacteria, very few compounds are currently under development or approved in the clinical setting. Repurposing compounds for other uses offers a productive strategy for the development of new antibiotics. Here we report that the multifaceted melatonin effectively improves survival rates of mice and decreases bacterial loads in the lung during infection. Mechanistically, melatonin specifically inhibits the activity of citrate synthase of Gram-negative pathogens through directly binding to the R300, D363, and H265 sites, particularly for the notorious Pasteurella multocida. These findings highlight that usage of melatonin is a feasible and alternative therapy to tackle the increasing threat of Gram-negative pathogen infections via disrupting metabolic flux of bacteria."

669,Rainfall intensification increases nitrate leaching from tilled but not no-till cropping systems in the US Midwest,"Hess, Laura J. T.; Hinckley, Eve-Lyn S.; Robertson, G. Philip; Matson, Pamela A.","As global surface temperatures rise, the percentage of total precipitation that falls in extreme events is increasing in many areas (""rainfall intensification""), including the U.S. Midwest, a major agricultural region. While it is well known that losses of nitrogen (N) fertilizers applied in excess of crop N demand have consequences for non-agricultural ecosystems, the effects of rainfall intensification on N losses from agricultural fields are uncertain. We conducted a 234-day field experiment in which we evaluated the effects of rainfall intensification on N leaching, soil inorganic N pools, soil N transformations, and crop N content in replicated tilled and no-till row crop systems of the upper Midwest. Under rainfall exclusion shelters we exposed 5x5m plots to a control rainfall treatment with relatively small, frequent rainfall events historically typical of the region, and an intensified rainfall treatment with the same total rainfall added in larger, less frequent events. Although rainfall intensification increased modeled water percolation to 1.2m in both tilled and no-till systems, as reported previously, it increased nitrate leaching only in tilled systems. Extractable soil nitrate concentrations throughout the experiment were on average 32 % higher in surface soils exposed to intensified rainfall compared to control rainfall regardless of tillage management. In-situ net N mineralization and nitrification rates measured during a two-week period in summer showed no significant differences between rainfall or tillage treatments. Inorganic N pools (0-1.2m depth) were 43 % greater in no-till soils compared to tilled soils and were unaffected by rainfall intensification; crop N concentrations and total N were likewise unaffected. Our results suggest that rainfall intensification in tilled cropping systems will increase N leaching to groundwater, with consequent economic and environmental harm. No-till management, however, may buffer systems against the effects of intensification on nitrate loss."
670,Microwave Pyrolysis of Macadamia Shells for Efficiently Recycling Lithium from Spent Lithium-ion Batteries,"Zhao, Yunze; Liu, Bingguo; Zhang, Libo; Guo, Shenghui","To reduce harm to the environment and human health and improve economic benefits, the large number of spent lithium-ion batteries that have been produced in recent years need to be reasonably recycled. The purpose of this article is to study a new method, microwave pyrolysis of the shells of macadamia nuts, for efficient recycling of lithium from spent lithium-ion batteries. XRD, SEM, and TGA analyses were used to observe the phase change during roasting. With the help of microwave heating and biomass pyrolysis, the decomposition temperature of Li(Ni1/3Co1/3Mn1/3)O-2 was reduced to 300 degrees C. Carbonated water-soluble Li2CO3 was formed under the action of biochar. Accordingly, the effects of pyrolysis temperature (Pte), biomass dose (bio%), reduction roasting temperature (Rte) and reduction roasting time (Rti) on the leaching rate of lithium were studied, and the results indicated that 93.4% lithium could be leached under the following optimum conditions: bio% = 24, Pte = 500 degrees C, Rte = 750 degrees C, and Rti = 25 min. A lattice collapse model and coupling reaction theory explained the benefit of biomass pyrolysis on the decomposition of Li(Ni1/3Co1/3Mn1/3)O-2. Finally, we designed a complete process for recycling the cathode powder of spent lithium-ion batteries. This study can guide industrial production to recover lithium-ion batteries in the future."
671,Are eco-innovation and export diversification mutually exclusive to control carbon emissions in G-7 countries?,"Wang, Lu; Chang, Hsu-Ling; Rizvi, Syed Kumail Abbas; Sari, Arif","Most of the member countries of COP21 have been struggling to devise relevant policies in order to control carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions since the Paris agreement in 2015. In our view, without analyzing the role of two extremely important variables i.e., ecological innovation and export diversification, in the whole chain of carbon emissions, expecting significant results from such policies would be far fetched. This study, therefore, is aimed to explore the effect of export diversification (ED) and ecological innovation (EI) on carbon emissions for G-7 countries from 1990 to 2017, along with renewable energy consumption (REC) as an important control variable. The results show that export diversification (ED) increases carbon emissions; however, ecological innovation (EI) helps reduce carbon emissions, and similarly, renewable energy consumption (REC) also controls carbon emissions. More important, however, is the realization that the negative impact of export diversification on the CO2 emissions gets weakened as the degree of environmental innovation increases. Based on our findings, the promotion of renewable energy, along with the adoption of environmentally friendly technology, is strongly recommended for G-7 countries. Our results also highlight that Government policies regarding export diversification (ED), ecological innovation (EI), and renewable energy consumption (REC) approximately take more than a year to be able to deliver the results effectively."

However, studies into its safety regarding herb-drug interactions have been neglected. This study investigated the risk of dill-induced herb-drug interactions (HDI) by examining its effect on the expression of phase I and II drug-metabolizing enzyme and transporter genes in Caco-2 cells. &lt;b&gt;Materials and Methods:&lt;/b&gt; Caco-2 cells (5×10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; cells/well) were treated with 10 μM ketoconazole, 20 μM rifampicin or dill extract (60-240 μg mL&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;) for 72 hrs. Cell viability was assessed using the resazurin assay and reactive oxygen species (ROS) content was determined with 2 ,7 -dichlorofluorescein diacetate. Aspartate (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels were measured using L-aspartate and L-alanine with α-ketoglutarate as substrate.

Natamycin penetration was examined using an in vitro iontophoresis system that simulates clinical scenario; menthol (0.1-0.3%, w/v) was added to the donor reservoir of a standard Franz diffusion chambers. In vivo effects of menthol on natamycin penetration were examined in a set of bioassays using rabbits inoculated with Aspergillus fumigatus in the right eye. Potential irritation to the rabbit eye was examined using a standard test. Menthol significantly (p<0.05) potentiated the effects of iontophoresis on natamycin penetration. The optimal combination seemed to be 0.2% menthol in combination with 3 mA/cm2 iontophoresis."

The study was based on ESG ranking scores in the Thomson Reuters database, and the sample comprised 1317 emerging market firms and 3569 developed market firms. In comparison with developed market firms, emerging market firms had higher ESG combined scores, ESG Controversy scores, category scores of resources use, workforce, human rights and corporate social responsibility strategy scores. This study finds that stakeholder initiatives positively impact valuation effects, based on all sample results. Firm-generated controversies may decrease valuation effects in the stock market. Results indicated that ESG initiatives have a significant positive to the firm performance. The presence of independent board members and ownership by investors is a positive determinant for value creation. The adoption of best practice corporate governance principles is an important determinant of the valuation of firms. Firms' propensity to use defence mechanisms decreases valuation effects. Developed market firms received positive valuation effects due to ESG initiatives."
675,Impact of Geographic Distribution of COVID-19 Cases on Hotels' Performances: Case of Polish Cities,"Napierala, Tomasz; Lesniewska-Napierala, Katarzyna; Burski, Rafal","The main goal of the article is to describe the short-term impacts of reported new cases and deaths of the COVID-19 disease on hotels' performances in the nine major Polish urban hotel markets: Krakow, Warszawa, Pozna, Wrocaw, Gdask, Lublin, od, Katowice, and Sopot. Time range of the analysis covers the period from January 5, 2020 (the beginning of the very first week when the COVID-19 cases were evidenced) to March 14, 2020 (the initial phase of lockdown was introduced by the Polish government). Various geographical contexts of the COVID-19 impacts are considered: national, European, and global. Generalized method of moments was applied to investigate the influence of reported COVID-19 cases (deaths) on both occupancy and revenue per available room. The results show that the most significant, negative impact of the pandemic on hotel performances is confirmed at the European level of the COVID-19 outbreak. Moreover, the negative influence of national cases of COVID-19 is more significant in less internationalized (or less-populated) urban destinations. Thus, the hotel industry (especially in the most internationalized, biggest Polish cities) might be recovered only when issues of the COVID-19 epidemic will be solved at the European level."
676,Life cycle costing for plasma gasification of municipal solid waste: A socio-economic approach,"Ramos, Ana; Berzosa, Joan; Espi, Jose; Clarens, Frederic; Rouboa, Abel","Fossil fuels contribute to climate changes, negatively affecting the environment. Waste has been seen as a possible resource for energy production, constituting a cleaner alternative to replace non-renewable fuels through waste-to-energy (WtE) techniques. Plasma gasification is a procedure that decomposes the molecules at high temperatures, affording a synthetic gas (syngas) that can further produce electricity, fuels and chemicals. Within the most used WtE technologies, plasma gasification is recent and therefore not yet widely applied. Thus, a viability study to support the thorough understanding and implementation of this treatment is required. This paper assesses the socio-economic aspects of plasma gasification promoting a more sustained waste management system, also taking advantage of the commodity assets granted by the technique. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first time that an importance-fulfilment matrix is specifically developed to appraise the socio-economic viability of plasma gasification, combining environmental, technical, economic and social aspects. Although depicting high capital costs, plasma gasification enabled high revenues, rebating the operational costs. The sensitivity analysis exhibited a descending impact in the profitability of the plant for varying electricity sales price, landfill fee, discount rate, vitrified slag sales price and initial investment."
677,"Assessment and prediction of the water ecological carrying capacity in Changzhou city, China","Bu, Jiuhe; Li, Chunhui; Wang, Xuan; Zhang, Yuan; Yang, Zhongwen","With rapid economic development and population growth, pressure on the urban ecological environment is becoming intense, and the ecological environment carrying capacity is becoming an important issue. In this study, an index system combining the system dynamics (SD) and analytic hierarchy process (AHP) methods was constructed to assess the water ecological carrying capacity (WECC) of Changzhou city. In particular, the construction of the aquatic habitat and aquatic organism indexes were constructed and showed that water ecology health should be monitored along with the economy and population, which were focused in the past. Scientific research has neglected the internal spatial heterogeneity in administrative regions. Therefore, the SD and AHP models were applied to simulate the WECC of administrative regions and control units from 2010 to 2016. The simulation results show that the WECC of Liyang and Jintan counties reached a safe carrying capacity state, while the urban districts were in a critically overloaded state. In addition, the MIKE11 model was adopted to simulate the WECC under different inflow and the river connectivity index scenarios, and the optimal parameters for improving the WECC were obtained when the inflow recharge was 10m(3)/s and the river connectivity index exceeded 60%. The prediction results from the optimized WECC showed that the WECC of all administrative areas and control units in Changzhou city reached the safe carrying capacity state. The results provide insights for improving the WECC of Changzhou city. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."
678,Avoiding immediate whole-body trauma CT: a prospective observational study in stable trauma patients,"Elisa Reitano,Stefano Granieri,Fabrizio Sammartano,Stefania Cimbanassi,Miriam Galati,Shailvi Gupta,Angelo Vanzulli,Osvaldo Chiara,Elisa Reitano,Stefano Granieri,Fabrizio Sammartano,Stefania Cimbanassi,Miriam Galati,Shailvi Gupta,Angelo Vanzulli,Osvaldo Chiara","High energy blunt trauma patients with normal vital signs are usually investigated with a Contrast Enhanced Computed Tomography (CECT) for torso injuries. CECT involves high levels of radiations, often showing no injuries in patients over-triaged to the trauma center. The aim of our study was to suggest an alternative diagnostic protocol based on Emergency Room (ER) tests (physical exam, blood tests, extended FAST, Chest and Pelvis X-ray) to avoid CECT in selected patients. A prospective cohort study was conducted from September 2018 to September 2019. Five hundred patients fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Patients received torso-CECT scan only if they had at least one positive ER test. The validity of the single component of the protocol and the global validity of the ER tests to detect torso injuries was assessed through sensitivity, specificity, positive (PPV) and negative (NPV) predictive value, positive (+ LR) and negative (- LR) likelihood ratio. Multivariate analysis was performed to identify independent predictors of torso injuries. One hundred and seventy patients received a torso-CECT scan because of positive ER tests. ER tests showed a global sensitivity for torso injuries of 86.96% (95% CI 80.17-92.08) specificity of 83.98%(95% CI 79.79-87.60), PPV of 67.42% (95% CI 61.83-72.54), NPV of 94.41% (95% CI 91.63-96.30) + LR of 5.43 (95% CI 4.25-6.93), - LR of 0.16 (95% CI 0.10-0.24). ER tests in an experienced center seem to be able to identify more severe blunt trauma patients needing CECT. Further studies are advisable to confirm these results."
679,Systematic literature review of insulin dose adjustments when initiating hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis,"Emily Blaine,Robin Tumlinson,Marion Colvin,Tyler Haynes,Heather P Whitley,Emily Blaine,Robin Tumlinson,Marion Colvin,Tyler Haynes,Heather P Whitley","Chronically uncontrolled hyperglycemia is the leading cause of end stage kidney disease (ESKD) necessitating dialysis. During times of transition to hemodialysis (HD) or peritoneal dialysis (PD), considerations must be given to insulin dosing adjustments for persons with diabetes (PWD) in efforts to maintain glycemic control. However, the literature is sparse with few clear and direct practical clinical recommendations for therapeutic insulin dosing adjustments in PWD and ESKD. The objective of this systematic review was to identify and report the evidence and gaps in the literature for adjustments in therapeutic insulin recommendations when initiating HD or PD in patients with ESKD and diabetes mellitus. A literature search using PubMed, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, CINAHL, Google Scholar, and ClinicalTrials.gov revealed 242 results. After removing duplicates and articles not reaching pre-specified criteria, 29 relevant articles remained for further analysis. Following the exclusion of 18 articles after full-text review due to lack of relevance or inappropriate publication type, 11 articles remained and were included in the review. The most common recommendation regarding HD was to reduce the basal insulin dose up to 25% on HD days to prevent hypoglycemia, although a lack of consensus exists on the percent reduction. Little information was found relating to insulin management with continuous ambulatory PD or automated PD. During PD, insulin may be administered subcutaneously, IP, or with the dialysis fluid. Administration of insulin with dialysate may necessitate a dose increase of up to 30% due to a loss to tubing and dilution. Furthermore, the use of dextrose-based dialysate may require additional insulin to mitigate systemic impact of dextrose absorption on BG. Overall, a gap exists in the primary literature regarding recommendations for prophylactically adjusting insulin therapy when initiating HD or PD, or when switching between the two. More research is needed to clarify ideal alterations in insulin dosing, administration techniques, and product selections for PWD and ESKD undergoing dialysis."

However, caring for hemorrhaging patients on the battlefield presents unique challenges that extend beyond applying a tourniquet and giving a blood transfusion, especially when battlefield care must be provided for a prolonged period. This review describes these challenges and potential strategies for treating hemorrhage on the battlefield in a prolonged casualty care situation."
681,The E3 Ubiquitin Ligase TRAF6 Interacts with the Cellular Prion Protein and Modulates Its Solubility and Recruitment to Cytoplasmic p62/SQSTM1-Positive Aggresome-Like Structures,"Lara Masperone,Marta Codrich,Francesca Persichetti,Stefano Gustincich,Silvia Zucchelli,Giuseppe Legname,Lara Masperone,Marta Codrich,Francesca Persichetti,Stefano Gustincich,Silvia Zucchelli,Giuseppe Legname","The cellular prion protein (PrPC) is a ubiquitous glycoprotein highly expressed in the brain where it is involved in neurite outgrowth, copper homeostasis, NMDA receptor regulation, cell adhesion, and cell signaling. Conformational conversion of PrPC into its insoluble and aggregation-prone scrapie form (PrPSc) is the trigger for several rare devastating neurodegenerative disorders, collectively referred to as prion diseases. Recent work indicates that the ubiquitin-proteasome system is involved in quality control of PrPC. To better dissect the role of ubiquitination in PrPC physiology, we focused on the E3 RING ubiquitin ligase tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR)-associated factor 6 (TRAF6). Here, we report that PrPC interacts with TRAF6 both in vitro, in cells, and in vivo, in the mouse brain. Transient overexpression of TRAF6 indirectly modulates PrPC ubiquitination and triggers redistribution of PrPC into the insoluble fraction. Importantly, in the presence of wild-type TRAF6, but not a mutant lacking E3 ligase activity, PrPC accumulates into cytoplasmic aggresome-like inclusions containing TRAF6 and p62/SQSTM1. Our results suggest that TRAF6 ligase activity could exert a role in the regulation of PrPC redistribution in cells under physiological conditions. This novel interaction may uncover possible mechanisms of cell clearance/reorganization in prion diseases."

Existing remediation methods are restricted, necessitating the development of novel remediation technologies. Nanomaterials with unique characteristics have recently been developed for remediation. Quantum dots (QDs) are semiconductor nanoparticles (1-10 nm) with optical and electrical characteristics that differ from bigger particles owing to quantum mechanics, making them intriguing for sensing and remediation applications. Carbon dots (CDs) offer better characteristics than typical QDs, such as, CdSe QDs in terms of contaminant sensing and remediation. Non-toxicity, chemical inertness, photo-induced electron transfer, good biocompatibility, and adjustable photoluminescence behavior are all characteristics of CDs. CDs are frequently made from sustainable raw materials as they are cost-effective, environmentally compactable, and excellent in reducing waste generation. The goal of this review article is to briefly describe CDs fabrication methods, to deeply investigate the criteria and properties of CDs that make them suitable for sensing and remediation of contaminants, and also to highlight recent advances in their use in sensing and remediation of contaminants."

However, there is uncertainty regarding the psychological instruments for this domain. Hence, this review systematically assessed the existing measurement instruments used, developed, and/or validated for the measurement of psychological outcomes in Asian adult patients with AD as well as the scope of those assessment tools (e.g. validity and reliability). Electronic searches were performed using six databases (inception to February 2020) to identify studies. Thematic analysis of 44 included studies revealed that the commonly employed tools to assess the quality of life were the Dermatology Life Quality Index followed by the Skindex-16 questionnaire, the European Quality of Life-5 Dimensions, and the Quality of Life Hand Eczema Questionnaire. Similarly, the Patient Health Questionnaire, Self-rating depression scale (SDS), and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale were frequently employed to assess depressive symptoms. Additionally, symptoms of anxiety were frequently assessed through Interaction Anxiousness Scale and the Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory. Although a variety of psychological assessment measures have been used in research, data on their reliability and validity is limited. Also, information on the cultural applicability of these instruments is scantier. More research is needed to ascertain the suitability of tools for use in clinical practice."
684,The impact of regional industrial structure differences on carbon emission differences in China: An evolutionary perspective,"Zheng, Huiling; Gao, Xiangyun; Sun, Qingru; Han, Xiaodan; Wang, Ze","All industries produce different carbon emissions during their production process. Previous studies use multivariate regression or panel models to explore the impact of the industrial structure on regional carbon emissions differences based on time series data or panel data from the perspective of one-dimensional continuous variables. However, there are also regional differences in the factors affecting regional carbon emission differences, such as the economic development level, the industrial structure, and urbanization. The regional carbon emission difference matrix and the influencing factor difference matrix are relational variables, and it is difficult for traditional multiple regression analysis to study the relationship between relational variables. Thus, this paper proposes the perspective of two-dimensional difference relations for studying the influencing factors of regional carbon emission differences based on Quadratic Assignment Procedure model. Energy consumption and the value added by industrial processes in various industries from 30 regions in China are taken as the sample. The results of this study are as follows: carbon emissions are increasing and the differences in carbon emissions between regions are also increasing. There are obvious regional differences in the industrial structure, economic growth, population and urbanization in China. The influence and magnitude of the impact of regional industrial structure differences on regional carbon emission differences vary from year to year. Interregional differences in industry, construction and transportation and warehousing industries had a significantly positive impact on interregional differences in carbon emissions from 2007 to 2016. By analyzing the impact of the influence mechanism of regional industrial structure differences on carbon emissions, the findings of this study can identify some suggestions for regionally balanced emission reduction policies.

686,"Nexus between green finance, non-fossil energy use, and carbon intensity: Empirical evidence from China based on a vector error correction model","Ren, Xuedi; Shao, Qinglong; Zhong, Ruoyu","Previous studies have considered the effect of financial development on carbon emissions; however, few studies have explored the role of green finance in carbon mitigation. To bridge this gap, the current study constructs a green finance development index based on four indicators: green credit, green securities, green insurance, and green investment. A vector error correction model is used to analyze relationships between the development level of green finance, non-fossil energy consumption, and carbon intensity using data from 2000 to 2018. We find that China's green finance industry developed rapidly, and improvements in the green finance development index, as well as the increasing use of non-fossil energy, contributed to a reduction in carbon intensity. Simultaneously, an increase in carbon intensity inhibited the expansion of non-fossil energy use, impeded the investment flow to green projects, and ultimately led to a deterioration of green finance development. In addition, non-fossil energy consumption in China was primarily influenced by green finance and carbon intensity, with clear policy-driven effects. However, the impacts of green finance policies continually fell short and lacked continuity. This study proposes ways in which to improve the effect of green finance policy implementation, expand the consumption of non-fossil energy, and develop a carbon trading market.

687,Examining the impacts of economic and demographic aspects on the ecological footprint in South and Southeast Asian countries,"Sharma, Rajesh; Sinha, Avik; Kautish, Pradeep","The re-examination of the existing economic and environmental policies in the South and Southeast Asian countries seems to be necessary, as these countries are struggling to achieve the goals of sustainable development. For designing a long-term environmental policy, we intended to examine whether the selected economic and demographic indicators have influenced the ecological footprint in the eight developing countries of Asia from 1990 to 2015. The use of pooled mean group (PMG) approach allowed driving the long-run common coefficients, which may facilitate us to develop a common policy framework for fortifying the environmental quality. The computed results confirmed that the selected variables are cointegrated in the long run, and the variables, i.e., per capita income, nonrenewable energy usage, urbanization, fertility rate, and population density are observed as the significant drivers of the environmental pollution. Moreover, the consumption of renewable energy restored the environmental quality in these countries. Based on the results, we recommended the need for the diversification of the energy-basket for enhancement of the use of renewable energy resources. Further, through sensitization of the necessity of environmental conservation, the governments should promote less carbon-intense economic and demographic practices across the industries and sectors."
688,Effect of urbanization and international trade on CO2 emissions across 65 belt and road initiative countries,"Muhammad, Sulaman; Long, Xingle; Salman, Muhammad; Dauda, Lamini","This paper mainly investigates the impact of urbanization and international trade on CO2 across 65 Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) Countries from 2000 to 2016. The non-linear nexus between urbanization and CO2 emissions is explored through panel quantile regression. Different effects of exports and imports on CO2 is analyzed and compared across different income groups. 2SLS (2-stages least square) regression is employed to handle the endogeneity issue. The results confirmed an inverted U-shaped relationship between urbanization and CO2 emissions only in high income group, which is consistent with the theory of ecological modernization. EKC (Environmental Kuznets Curve) hypothesis is confirmed only in uppermiddle and high income groups. Foreign direct investment increased CO2 emissions, which supports ""pollution haven"" hypothesis. Exports decreased carbon emissions in low and high income countries, while increased it in lower-middle countries. Imports increased carbon emissions in low income countries, while decreased it in middle and high income countries. Our findings suggest that promoting industry agglomeration during urbanization and enhancing voluntary disclosure of environmental information of FDI firms can reduce carbon emissions.

689,Age of Acquisition and Spoken Words: Examining Hemispheric Differences in Lexical Processing,"Julio González-Alvarez,Teresa Cervera-Crespo,Julio González-Alvarez,Teresa Cervera-Crespo","The relationship between the age of acquisition (AoA) of words and their cerebral hemispheric representation is controversial because the experimental results have been contradictory. However, most of the lexical processing experiments were performed with stimuli consisting of written words. If we want to compare the processing of words learned very early in infancy-when children cannot read-with words learned later, it seems more logical to employ spoken words as experimental stimuli. This study, based on the auditory lexical decision task, used spoken words that were classified according to an objective criterion of AoA with extremely distant means (2.88 vs. 9.28 years old). As revealed by the reaction times, both early and late words were processed more efficiently in the left hemisphere, with no AoA × Hemisphere interaction. The results are discussed from a theoretical point of view, considering that all the experiments were conducted using adult participants."
690,Dynamic modelling and techno-economic analysis of adiabatic compressed air energy storage for emergency back-up power in supporting microgrid,"Li, Yaowang; Miao, Shihong; Luo, Xing; Yin, Binxin; Han, Ji; Wang, Jihong","Adiabatic compressed air energy storage technology recently attracts a great attention due to its merits of low cost, long lifetime and environmentally friendly. Several MW scale pilot plants were recently built to explore the technology deployment potential. With the encouragement of the success of these pilot plants, this paper presents the recent research in dynamic modelling and comprehensive techno-economic analysis of adiabatic compressed air energy storage in providing emergency back-up power to support microgrid operation. The dynamic modelling for key components of a MW scale adiabatic compressed air energy storage plant and the associated microgrid is carried out. The models developed are used for analyzing the system dynamic performance while it provides emergency back-up power. Then, the economic benefit estimation model is developed for conducting a comprehensive economic analysis in order to understand the economic gains of adiabatic compressed air energy storage operation with different microgrid configurations, power supply reliabilities and diesel prices. The simulation results indicate that the MW scale adiabatic compressed air energy storage can normally fully restore the power supply to important loads within several minutes. It is acceptable for the load with no strict requirement on power outage time, but its standalone operation cannot meet the requirement of uninterruptable power source. For a microgrid having low power supply reliability requirement, high diesel price and abundant renewable energy sources, using adiabatic compressed air energy storage for providing emergency back-up power can achieve higher economic benefits compared with diesel generators."
691,Does renewable energy technological innovation control China's air pollution? A spatial analysis,"Zhu, Yongfeng; Wang, Zilong; Yang, Jie; Zhu, Lingling","China's rapid industrialization has led to severe air pollution, which has attracted considerable attention from academia and media. To achieve cleaner production, the Chinese government has incorporated the construction of ecological civilization into the overall layout of the 'Five in One' and proposed that environmental protection and economic development should be placed on an equal footing. Based on the panel dataset covering 31 Chinese provinces during 2011-2017, this study investigates the spatial features of air pollution and the relationship between energy technology innovation (RETI) and air pollution through Moran's I index and spatial panel econometric models. The results indicate that, first, the air quality in northern China is generally worse than in southern China, especially in Shanxi, Shandong, Hebei, and Henan. Second, technological innovations in renewable energy are beneficial to alleviate nitrogen oxides (NOx) and respirable suspended particles (PM10) concentrations, while they are not significantly associated with sulfur dioxide (SO2). Third, the spatial econometric model shows that the spatial spillover effects of SO2, NOx, and PM10 are 0.626, 0.585, and 0.177, respectively. It is suggested that regional and district policymakers need to consider spatial locations when improving air quality. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier Ltd."

In the current work, a total of 469,490 respiratory emergency room (ER) visits in Lanzhou, China from Jan 1, 2013 to Dec 31, 2016 were collected. A generalized additive model (GAM) was used to investigate the association between O3 and respiratory ER visits for the different gender and age subgroups. The results showed that: (a) with per inter-quartile range (IQR) (31 µg/m3) increase in O3, the greatest relative risk (RR) of respiratory ER visits for the total was 1.014 (95% CI 1.008-1.020) at lag 4 days. Females and 16-to-45-year-olds were relatively more sensitive to O3; (b) the significant lag effects were found in single-day lag models, with the highest RR values for different groups were observed at lag 3-lag 5 days. The multi-day cumulative lag effects were stronger for the total; (c) in the multiple-pollutant models, the effects of O3 were generally increased when introducing other pollutants (PM10, PM2.5, SO2 and NO2) for adjustment. This study demonstrated that short-term exposure to O3 increased the RR of respiratory ER visits in Lanzhou, China."
693,Preliminary techno-economic analysis of biodiesel production over solid- biochar,"Lee, Jae-Cheol; Lee, Boreum; Ok, Yong Sik; Lim, Hankwon","This study suggests the economic potential of biochar-based biodiesel production by conducting the techno-economic analysis. The itemized cost estimation was performed by categorizing biochar production facility and biodiesel conversion plants for 30,000 ton y(-1) of biodiesel production capacity. The result of sensitivity analysis shows the methanol and waste cooking oil (WCO) costs are significantly sensitive to determine a unit biodiesel production cost. When the biodiesel selling price was 1.70 $ kg(-1), the discounted payback period was varied from 1.91 (not discounted) to 2.06 years (10% discounted). In addition, the break-even price of biodiesel was calculated to 1.55 $ kg(-1) when the discount rate was 10%. It means that this technology is to be feasible because of commercial diesel price (0.97 to 1.88 $ kg(-1)). The consideration of tax exemption and subsidy for biodiesel can be good option to supply WCO based energy production."

Based on data from multiple sources, this paper attempts to measure the relationship between fisheries economic growth and marine environmental pollution among China's coastal regions over the past 17 years. For this purpose, it firstly quantifies changes in fisheries economy and fisheries population. It then goes onto comparing the degree of changes in fisheries economy and marine environment. Finally, it depicts the relationship between fisheries added value (FAV) and polluted marine area (PMA) and between per capita net income of fishermen (PCNIF) and PMA ratio. Results suggest that i) the compound annual growth rate of FAV, FAV per capita, and fisheries population are 835%, 8.61%, and -024%, respectively; ii) the difference of FAV per capita increases significantly over time, while that of PMA and PMA ratio decreases moderately; iii) the relationship between FAV and PMA and between PCNIF and PMA ratio in all China's Seas and in the East China Sea show the same inverted N-shape while in the South China Sea inverted U-shape. In the Bohai and Yellow Sea, the former's relationship exhibits inverted U-shape, with the latter's N-shape. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

The main novelty is related to the heat recovery from the exhaust gases of the EFGT via thermal energy storage (TES), and integration of heat from a parabolic-trough collectors (PTCs) field with molten salts as a heat-transfer fluid (HTF). The presence of a TES between the topping and bottoming cycles facilitates the flexible operation of the system, allows the system to compensate for solar energy input fluctuations, and increases capacity factor and dispatchability. A TES with two molten salt tanks (one cold at 200 degrees C and one hot at 370 degrees C) is chosen. The selected bottoming ORC is a superheated recuperative cycle suitable for heat conversion in the operating temperature range of the TES. The whole system is modelled by means of a Python-based software code, and three locations in the Mediterranean area are assumed in order to perform energy-yield analyses: Marseille in France, Priolo Gargallo in Italy and Rabat in Morocco. In each case, the thermal storage that minimizes the levelized cost of energy (LCE) is selected on the basis of the estimated solar radiation and CSP size. The results of the thermodynamic simulations, capital and operational costs assessments and subsidies (feed-in tariffs for biomass and solar electricity available in the Italian framework), allow estimating the global energy conversion efficiency and the investment profitability in the three locations. Sensitivity analyses of the biomass costs, size of PTCs, feed-in tariff and share of cogenerated heat delivered to the load are also performed. The results show that the high investment costs of the CSP section in the proposed size range and hybridization configuration allow investment profitability only in the presence of a dedicated subsidy framework such as the one available in the Italian energy market. In particular, the LCE of the proposed system is around 140 Eur/MWh (with the option to discharge the cogenerated heat) and the IRR is around 15%, based on the Italian electricity subsidy tariffs. The recovery of otherwise discharged heat to match thermal energy demand can significantly increase the investment profitability and compensate the high investment costs of the proposed technology.

696,A hybrid solar chimney/photovoltaic thermal system for direct electric power production and water distillation,"Kiwan, Suhil; Al-Nimr, Moh'd; Salim, Ismail","In this work, modifications are made on the conventional solar chimney system in order to improve its economic viability. The two main modifications are the addition of a photovoltaic (PV) system to increase the system total electricity production, and the installation of water pool to cool the PV panels as well as to allow the system to generate freshwater. A mathematical model is developed to test the feasibility of both the conventional and modified systems. It is found that the total system utilization factor for the conventional system is 0.51%, while the utilization factor for the modified system is 4.37%. Parametric analysis is conducted to determine the variables that lead to the best utilization factor. The best results are achieved when the submerged PV panels are closer to the chimney. Furthermore, the performance of the system is tested, taking into account the weather data of a location in the country of Jordan. The results showed that the proposed system produces 45.35% more electricity annually than a standalone PV system installed in the same location. Moreover, the sensitivity analysis conducted shows that the chimney height is the most significant variable influences the system utilization factor. That is, the higher the chimney, the higher the utilization factor. Finally, the economic analysis concludes that the cost of freshwater produced by the system is 1.60 US$ per cubic meter, which is 46.3% cheaper than what is produced using other similar systems. Also, the economic indices of the proposed system show an improvement from that for the conventional solar chimney."

To gain insight into mutations that drive breast tumorigenesis, we describe a pipeline for the identification and validation of tumor suppressor genes. Based on an in vivo genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 screen in Trp53+/- heterozygous mice, we identified tumor suppressor genes that included the scaffold protein Axin1, the protein kinase A regulatory subunit gene Prkar1a, as well as the proof-of-concept genes Pten, Nf1, and Trp53 itself. Ex vivo editing of primary mammary epithelial organoids was performed to further interrogate the roles of Axin1 and Prkar1a. Increased proliferation and profound changes in mammary organoid morphology were observed for Axin1/Trp53 and Prkar1a/Trp53 double mutants compared to Pten/Trp53 double mutants. Furthermore, direct in vivo genome editing via intraductal injection of lentiviruses engineered to express dual short-guide RNAs revealed that mutagenesis of Trp53 and either Prkar1a, Axin1, or Pten markedly accelerated tumor development compared to Trp53-only mutants. This proof-of-principle study highlights the application of in vivo CRISPR/Cas9 editing for uncovering cooperativity between defects in tumor suppressor genes that elicit mammary tumorigenesis."
698,A Quantitative Approach for Using Anticipatory Behavior as a Graded Welfare Assessment,"Aleksei A Podturkin,Bethany L Krebs,Jason V Watters,Aleksei A Podturkin,Bethany L Krebs,Jason V Watters","To perform quick assessments, welfare practitioners may focus on specific behavioral indicators of welfare, which can lead to challenges in interpretation. Anticipatory behavior has been suggested as a potentially graded indicator of well-being in animals. However, there are difficulties in assessing variations in this class of behavior quantitatively. Here, we propose an analytical approach for identifying and comparing the intensity of anticipatory behavior across different conditions. We evaluated the changes in the behavior of a sea lion at the San Francisco Zoo before and after daily training sessions, the start time of which had differing degrees of predictability. We show that anticipatory behavior is a complex suite of behaviors that can show multi-directional changes prior to an anticipated event. Additionally, we show that the methods utilized here can distinguish among differing intensities of anticipation directed toward daily husbandry events. We suggest that this approach may be broadly applicable for applying measures of anticipatory behavior as a graded welfare indicator."
699,"Long-run causal relationship between economic growth, transport energy consumption and environmental quality in Asian countries: Evidence from heterogeneous panel methods","Nasreen, Samia; Ben Mbarek, Mounir; Atiq-ur-Rehman, Muhammad","This paper analyzes data from 18 Asian countries, spanning from 1980 to 2017 to determine panel longrun causality between income growth, transport energy consumption and environmental quality. The empirical methodology of this paper considers structural breaks and cross-sectional dependence issues. In this way, our study becomes one of the few energy-GDP studies that address cross-sectional dependence in the unit root, cointegration, causality and elasticity estimation. We attempt to fill the gap in energy literature by using robust estimates in the case of Asian countries. After these methodological advances, a bi-directional long-run Granger causality between transport energy consumption, environment and GDP growth is found. The common correlated effects mean group (CMG) is used to obtain long-run elasticities. It is revealed that a 1% increase in transport energy consumption and GDP growth deteriorate environmental quality by about 0.57% and 0.46% respectively in Asian countries. Furthermore, the magnitude of elasticities varies from country to country. The empirical findings add new dimensions in energy-efficient technologies in the transport sector that positively affect economic growth without compromising environmental quality.

In this study, positively charged nanofiltration membranes were created via an addition of commercially available polyallylamine hydrochloride (PAH) by conventional interfacial polymerization technique. Demonstration of real increase in surface zeta potential, along with other characterization methods, confirmed the addition of weak basic functional groups from PAH. Both positively and negatively charged NF membranes were tested for evaluating their potential as a technology for the recovery or separation of lanthanide cations (neodymium and lanthanum chloride as model salts) from aqueous sources. Particularly, the NF membranes with added PAH performed high and stable lanthanides retentions, with values around 99.3% in mixtures with high ionic strength (100 mM, equivalent to ~6,000 ppm), 99.3% rejection at 85% water recovery (and high Na+/La3+ selectivity, with 0% Na+ rejection starting at 65% recovery), and both constant lanthanum rejection and permeate flux at even pH 2.7. Donnan steric pore model with dielectric exclusion elucidated the transport mechanism of lanthanides and sodium, proving the potential of high selective separation at low permeate fluxes using positively charged NF membranes."
701,Multi-objective economic dispatch of a microgrid considering electric vehicle and transferable load,"Hou, Hui; Xue, Mengya; Xu, Yan; Xiao, Zhenfeng; Deng, Xiangtian; Xu, Tao; Liu, Peng; Cui, Rongjian","In order to investigate the impact of electric vehicles' charging-discharging behaviour and demand side response resources on the economic operation of photovoltaic grid-connected microgrid system, a multi-objective model of microgrid economic dispatching with electric vehicles, transferable load and other distributed generations (diesel engines and energy storage unit) is proposed in this paper. The model takes the comprehensive operating cost of microgrid, the utilization rate of photovoltaic energy and the power fluctuation between the microgrid and main grid as objectives. Moreover, four different cases of microgrid economic dispatch considering electric vehicles and transferable load are put forward, which are electric vehicles' orderly charging and discharging and transferable load participating in demand response in Case 1, electric vehicles' charging randomly and the transferable load participating in demand response in Case 2, electric vehicles orderly charging and discharging and transferable load not participating in demand response in Case 3, electric vehicles' charging randomly and the transferable load not participating in the demand response in Case 4. Multi-objective Seeker Optimization Algorithm and the method of fuzzy membership function are applied in this study to obtain the optimal results. The simulation analysis shows that the orderly charging-discharging behaviour of electric vehicles and the participation of transferable load can effectively improve the economic costs, efficiency and security of microgrid economic operation."
702,The Dimming of Lights in China during the COVID-19 Pandemic,"Elvidge, Christopher D.; Ghosh, Tilottama; Hsu, Feng-Chi; Zhizhin, Mikhail; Bazilian, Morgan","A satellite survey of the cumulative radiant emissions from electric lighting across China reveals a large radiance decline in lighting from December 2019 to February 2020-the peak of the lockdown established to suppress the spread of COVID-19 infections. To illustrate the changes, an analysis was also conducted on a reference set from a year prior to the pandemic. In the reference period, the majority (62%) of China's population lived in administrative units that became brighter in March 2019 relative to December 2018. The situation reversed in February 2020, when 82% of the population lived in administrative units where lighting dimmed as a result of the pandemic. The dimming has also been demonstrated with difference images for the reference and pandemic image pairs, scattergrams, and a nightly temporal profile. The results indicate that it should be feasible to monitor declines and recovery in economic activity levels using nighttime lighting as a proxy."
703,NiCo2O4/biomass-derived carbon composites as anode for high-performance lithium ion batteries,"Zhang, Chi; Xie, Zhuohong; Yang, Wanfeng; Liang, Yi; Meng, Dingding; He, Xin; Liang, Ping; Zhang, Zhonghua","Low electronic conductivity and drastic volume change during cycling of transition metal oxides, as anodes for lithium ion batteries (LIBs), lead to rapid capacity decay and poor structural stability. Herein, nanostructured NiCo2O4 anchored on carbon sheets was synthesized by a facile hydrothermal method with following thermal treatment. The wrinkled carbon substrate in the composite derives from the carbonization of pomelo peels, which can be mass-produced for the large-scale application. This composite shows mesoporous structures with high specific surface areas and intimate NiCo2O4/carbon interfaces, which favors the alleviation of the volume expansion/shrink during charging/discharging process and improves the electron/mass transport, enhancing the capability and stability for LIBs. This composite delivers a high reversible capacity of 473.7 mA h g(-1) after 210 cycles at a current density of 500 mA g(-1). A long cycle life of up to 1100 cycles at 2000 mA g(-1) is achieved with the retention capacity of 363 mA h g(-1). The electrode also exhibits excellent rate capability and can regain its original capacities as reversing to the low current densities. This work highlights the biomass-derived carbon-supported metal oxides as an environmentally friendly and economic strategy for advanced LIBs."

Herein, total gaseous Hg (TGM) at an urban and a forest site on the Tibetan Plateau was collected respectively from May 2017 to October 2018, and isotopic compositions were measured to clarify the influences of landforms and monsoons on the transboundary transport of atmospheric Hg to the Tibetan Plateau. The transboundary transported anthropogenic emissions mainly originated over Indo-Gangetic Plain and carried over the Himalayas by convective storms and mid-tropospheric circulation, contributing over 50% to the TGM at the Lhasa urban site, based on the binary mixing model of isotopes. In contrast, during the transport of TGM from South Asia with low altitude, the uptake by evergreen forest in Yarlung Zangbo Grand Canyon largely decreased the TGM level and shifted isotopic compositions in TGM at the Nyingchi forest site, which are located at the high-altitude end of the canyon. Our results provided direct evidence from Hg isotopes to reveal the distinct patterns of transboundary transport to the Tibetan Plateau shaped by landforms and climates, which is critical to fully understand the biogeochemical cycling of Hg in the high-altitude regions."

Synthesized compounds were characterized and elucidated by IR, 1H NMR, ESI-MS spectra. Resultant compounds were screened for in vitro antimicrobial, cytotoxic, antioxidant, lipid peroxidation and cholinesterase inhibitory activities, in vivo analgesic and anti-inflammatory, and in silico anti-acetylcholinesterase and anti-butyrylcholinesterase activities. Among the synthesized compounds, compound 3b showed most promising central analgesic effect (46.15%) compared to morphine (48.08%), whereas compounds 6, 3c and 3a showed significant peripheral analgesic activity at two different dose levels (25 mg/kg and 50 mg/kg). Compounds 3b and 3a at the dose of 100 mg/kg showed significant anti-inflammatory effects from the first hour and onward, whereas compounds 6 and 3b showed moderate cytotoxic activities. In addition, compound 3a showed significant antioxidant activity having IC50 value of 16.73 µg/ml compared to 14.44 µg/ml for the standard BHT. Compound 6, 3a and 3b exhibited mild to moderate cholinesterase inhibitory activity. In silico studies revealed that compound 3a and 3b might be suitable for cholinesterase inhibitory activity. A comprehensive computational and experimental data suggested compounds 3b and 3a as the best possible candidates for pharmacological activity. All the experimental data were statistically significant (p < 0.01 level)."
706,Cost-optimal economic potential of shared rooftop PV in energy communities: Evidence from Austria,"Fina, Bernadette; Auer, Hans; Friedl, Werner","In this study, a model is developed to estimate the cost-optimal large-scale economic potential of shared rooftop PV systems based on neighbourhood energy communities (ECs). In a first step, an optimisation model determines the cost-optimal rooftop PV capacities for representative neighbourhood ECs in characteristic settlement patterns (SPs). Next, the number of ECs in the large-scale area of investigation is determined by allocating buildings to SPs and ECs. Finally, the optimal large-scale, EC-based rooftop PV potential is determined by upscaling. A case study is provided for Austria, identifying a cost-optimal economic rooftop PV potential of approximately 10GW(p). This PV capacity would already be sufficient (in terms of expected PV deployment) to meet the Austrian 2030 policy goal of a 100% renewable electricity generation. However, results also indicate that accommodating the cost-optimal rooftop PV capacity is difficult in cities/towns in contrast to rural areas. Thus, future ECs should be implemented not only on neighbourhood level, but across the boundaries of different SPs. Different sensitivity analyses are conducted, notably in terms of varying retail electricity prices, including a variation of distribution grid tariff structures, and PV system cost. The trade-off between these sensitivity parameters is critically discussed and provides recommendations for future work. (C) 2020 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd."
707,Biomass ash stabilized MgO adsorbents for CO2 capture application,"Guo, Yafei; Tan, Chang; Sun, Jian; Li, Weiling; Zhang, Jubing; Zhao, Chuanwen","Supported MgO adsorbents were prepared from the calcination of MgCl2 center dot 6H(2)O preloaded on several biomass wastes including sugarcane bagasse, coffee grounds, rice husk, and saw dust. CO2 adsorption behaviors of the adsorbents with different supports and MgO loadings were investigated using a fixed-bed reactor. The modified Avrami fractional kinetic model was adopted to correlate their CO2 uptakes to evaluate the CO2 adsorption kinetic performance. Amongst the prepared MgO adsorbents, the rice husk ash supported sample (MgO-RHA) featured high CO2 adsorption capacity, due to the good textural properties, nano-crystallization of MgO particles, the uniform dispersion of active components and the enriched surface basicity. CO2 uptakes of MgO-RHA increased first and then decreased with the increasing MgO loading. CO2 adsorption kinetic would be hampered by higher MgO contents because of the increased diffusion resistance and decreased MgO utilization. The adsorbent with 20 wt% MgO loading exhibited the highest CO2 uptake of 4.56 mmol CO2/g. Besides, the desired adsorbent presented good working stability with 7.68% loss-in-capacity in 10 repeated cycles. Recycling waste MgCl2 center dot 6H(2)O and biomass residues to synthesize CO2 adsorbents provides remarkable economic and environmental implications, from the prospective of CO2 emission mitigation and waste management."
708,Do beliefs in the malleability of well-being affect the efficacy of positive psychology interventions? Results of a randomized placebo-controlled trial,"Fabian Gander,René T Proyer,Willibald Ruch,Fabian Gander,René T Proyer,Willibald Ruch","The present study examines the role of beliefs about the malleability of well-being in a randomized, placebo-controlled, online positive psychology intervention targeting 267 German-speaking adults (83% women, mean age = 43.16 years). The participants of the experimental group (""three good things"" intervention) and placebo control group (""early memories"") reported their levels of happiness before and immediately after the 1-week intervention, as well as 2, 4, and 12 weeks after the intervention. Furthermore, the researchers recorded how participants completed the exercises and to what extent they liked the exercises. This study also assesses the participants' beliefs surrounding two different aspects of malleability (well-being is modifiable in general, and one knows how to change their well-being). Although both aspects of malleability were strongly intercorrelated, beliefs about how to change one's well-being seemed particularly relevant in the context of positive psychology interventions: Those who reported a stronger belief about how to change their well-being liked the intervention better and more often completed the activity as instructed. Further, they reported greater increases in well-being as compared with the control group. We conclude that beliefs about the malleability of well-being might represent an important moderating variable in the effectiveness of positive psychology interventions."
709,Understanding access to healthcare for gender diverse young people: a critical review of the literature,"Charlotte Lovejoy,Lisa Fitzgerald,Allyson Mutch,Charlotte Lovejoy,Lisa Fitzgerald,Allyson Mutch","Gender diverse young people face well-documented physical, mental and sexual health disparities compared to the general population. Differential access to healthcare is a key driver of these inequities and literature highlights high unmet healthcare need among members of this group. Healthcare access has been described through a model that defines five dimensions of health services: approachability; acceptability; availability and accommodation; affordability; and appropriateness; and five abilities of health service consumers that interact with these dimensions: the abilities to perceive, seek, reach, pay and engage. This comprehensive literature review examined barriers to and facilitators of healthcare access among gender diverse young people using the lens provided by this model as it relates to dimensions of access at the health service level and/or the abilities of health service users. We advocate expansion of this model to incorporate demand- and supply-side barriers and facilitators of access, and important structural factors including the gender binary health system framework, intersectionality and stigma. Findings highlight the need for improvements to healthcare provider education and the participatory redesign of health services with a focus on intersectionality, individually-tailored service provision and healthcare that is responsive to the unique needs of gender diverse young people."
710,Using Protection Motivation Theory to Predict Adherence to COVID-19 Behavioral Guidelines,"Gabriel Nudelman,Shanmukh Vasant Kamble,Kathleen Otto,Gabriel Nudelman,Shanmukh Vasant Kamble,Kathleen Otto","COVID-19 has become a global pandemic. Throughout most of the pandemic, mitigating its spread has relied on human behavior, namely on adherence to protective behaviors (e.g., wearing a face mask). This research proposes that Protection Motivation Theory (PMT) can contribute to understanding differences in individual adherence to COVID-19 behavioral guidelines. PMT identifies four fundamental cognitive components that drive responses to fear appeals: perceptions of susceptibility (to the disease), severity (of the disease), self-efficacy (to protect oneself), and response efficacy (i.e., recommended behaviors' effectiveness). Two online self-report studies assessed PMT components' capacity to predict adherence to protective behaviors concurrently and across culturally different countries (Israel, Germany, India; Study 1), and again at six-week follow-up (Israeli participants; Study 2). Study 1's findings indicate excellent fit of the PMT model, with about half of the variance in adherence explained. No significant differences were found between participants from Israel (n = 917), Germany (n = 222) and India (n = 160). Study 2 (n = 711) confirmed that PMT components continue to predict adherence after six weeks. In both studies, response efficacy was the PMT component most strongly associated with adherence levels. This study demonstrates that PMT can serve as a theoretical framework to better understand differences in adherence to COVID-19 protective behaviors. The findings may further inform the design of adherence-promoting communications, suggesting that it may be beneficial to highlight response efficacy in such messages."

Disease epidemiology has changed over time, shifting towards the adolescent and adult populations. In adults, the true burden of pertussis is greatly underestimated and pertussis vaccine coverage rates are suboptimal, including individuals with chronic conditions. Here, we report the outcomes of a virtual international scientific workshop to assess the evidence on the burden of pertussis in older adults and identify potential solutions to improve uptake of pertussis vaccines. In adults, pertussis is underdiagnosed in part due to atypical or milder clinical presentation and the lack of testing and case confirmation. However, contemporary epidemiological data denoted an increase in the burden of pertussis among adolescents and adults. This might be related to a variety of reasons including the waning of immunity over time, the lack of booster vaccination, and the improved diagnostic methods that led to increased recognition of the disease in adults. Pertussis sequelae can be severe in older adults, particularly those with existing chronic medical conditions, and the vulnerability of these groups is further enhanced by low pertussis vaccine coverage. Possible measures to increase vaccine uptake include strengthening and harmonisation of immunisation guidelines, healthcare professionals taking a more active role in recommending pertussis vaccination, involvement of vaccination centres and pharmacies in the vaccination process, and improving knowledge of pertussis burden and vaccine efficacy among the general population."

Based on the modeling, the system is comprehensively evaluated by multiple approaches including energy, exergy, exergoeconomic and environmental analyses. It is found that the overall energy efficiency and exergy efficiency of the hybrid system could reach up to 68% and 51%, both of which are comparable to those of other reported hybrid fuel cell systems. The exergy destruction of the gasifier is the largest whose relative exergy destruction is up to 21.5%. The component of fuel cell contributes to 71% of the total power but with small relative exergy destruction. On the contrary, the HCCI engine contributes to less power but has larger exergy destruction compared to SOFC. The exergoeconomic analysis showed that the fuel cell component has a high exergoeconomic factor of 98.09% due to the large capital investment cost. By comparison, the component engine has much lower exergoeconomic factors of 5.41%. The cost of exergetic product of the hybrid system is 9.7 $/GJ. Besides, the proposed hybrid system presents a low carbon dioxide emission of about 0.119 to 0.139 t/GJ, which indicates few environmental impacts for the system. These results reveal that the proposed biomass-fueled hybrid system is high-efficiency, low-cost and clean for both power and heat generation, which could be promising candidate as advanced energy conversion technology in practical applications."
714,Flexural behavior of glass fiber-reinforced recycled aggregate concrete and its impact on the cost and carbon footprint of concrete pavement,"Ali, Babar; Qureshi, Liaqat Ali; Khan, Sibghat Ullah","In this study, an effort is presented, towards the appraisal of the economic and environmental performance of concrete pavement with the glass fiber (GF) reinforced concrete with and without concrete waste aggregates (CWA). The performance of pavement with plain and fiber-reinforced concretes was compared based on the results of economic and environmental analysis. Firstly, this study evaluated the important mechanical properties (flexural strength, elastic modulus, and residual strength) of the concrete mixes incorporating different quantities of CWA (as 0%, 30%, 50% and 100% replacement of natural coarse aggregate) and GF (as 0%, 0.25%, 0.5% and 1% volume fraction). Then, the mechanical properties were used to design the thickness of jointed plain concrete pavement (JPCP) for different concrete mixes under similar design loading conditions. Finally, using the cost and carbon emissions of each mix per cubic meter; the cost of pavement (CP) and carbon emissions of pavement (EP) per square meter were evaluated. The results of flexural testing revealed that CWA concretes with a small percentage of GF (i.e. 0.25%) can yield better flexural strength, toughness, and residual strength than conventional plain concrete. CP and EP analysis showed the remarkable economic and environmental benefits of fiberreinforced concrete application in JPCP. At any level of CWA, 0.25%GF addition into concrete yielded concrete pavement with a 20% lower cost and carbon-footprint than that produced with the conventional plain concrete. The CWA level can be maximized into concrete pavement with the GF addition, otherwise plain CWA concrete yields cost and carbon footprint similar to that of the conventional concrete.

715,"Globalization and carbon emissions: Is there any role of agriculture value-added, financial development, and natural resource rent in the aftermath of COP21?","Wang, Lei; Xuan Vinh Vo; Shahbaz, Muhammad; Ak, Aysegul","Keeping in view the catastrophic effects of environmental degradation, G7 countries agree to implement the policy recommendations of the famous Paris Climate Agreement (COP21) in 2015; carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions are increasing in G7 countries, which is a severe threat for the environment of the world. This study examines the effects of economic globalization on environmental degradation (CO2 emissions) for G7 countries for the period of 1996-2017. We further examine the role of financial development, agriculture value-added, and natural resources in the relationship between economic globalization and CO2 emissions. This study contributes to the existing literature by providing new empirical evidence on how economic globalization, along with financial development, agriculture value-added, and natural resources affect CO2 emissions in G7 economies. This study utilizes novel econometric techniques such as CS-ARDL for short-run and long-run results of the empirical analysis. The empirical findings show that economic globalization, financial development, and natural resources increase carbon emissions. In contrast, agriculture value-added decreases carbon emissions. This study suggests that policies designed for controlling carbon emissions should be absorbed in approximately more than one year."
716,Techno-economic analysis of coke oven gas and blast furnace gas to methanol process with carbon dioxide capture and utilization,"Deng, Lingyan; Adams, Thomas A., II","This paper documents a process for converting coke oven gas (COG) and blast furnace gas (BFG) from steel refineries into methanol. Specifically, we propose the use of blast furnace gas (BFG) as an additional carbon source. The high CO(2 )and CO content of BFG make it a good carbon resource. In the proposed process, CO2 is recovered from the BFG and blended with H2O, H-2, and CH4-rich COG to reform methane. Optimized amounts of H2O and CO2 are used to adjust the (H-2 - CO2)/(CO + CO2) molar ratio in order to maximize the amount of methanol that is produced. In addition, the desulphurization process was modified to enable the removal of sulfur compounds, especially thiophene, from the COG. The process design and simulation results reported herein were then used to determine any potential environmental and economic benefits. This research is based on off-gas conditions provided by ArcelorMittal Dofasco (AMD), Hamilton, Ontario. In order to determine which conditions are most desirable for this retrofit strategy, potential greenhouse gas reduction and economic benefits were analyzed. In particular, this analysis focused on the heating utility chosen for methane reformation prior to methanol synthesis. To this end, COG, BFG, and natural gas (NG) were compared. The results showed that using BFG/NG as a heating utility can produce greater economic gains, and that synthesizing COG + BFG to methanol results in greater economic and environmental gains than solely producing electricity (the status quo). Compared to current operating procedures, the proposed process could potentially increase net present values by up to $54 million. The carbon efficiency achieved was up to 72%. An additional 0.73 kg of CO2 from BFG is needed for every 1 kg of MeOH produced. About 52% of feedstock energy is converted to MeOH, with another 33% recovered in the form of utilities. The exergy efficiency of the recommended version of the system is about 61%. The business case for converting CO2 into methanol highly depends on the local electricity grid carbon intensity. For Ontario, it can reduce direct CO2 emissions by 228 ktonne per year, and fix up to 246 ktonne CO2 into methanol per year. In addition, analyses of location effects, CO2 taxes, electricity prices, electricity carbon intensity, methanol prices, and income taxes indicated that MeOH production is highly recommended for Ontario, Mexico, the USA, and China applications. For USA, build MeOH plant is recommended for Finland, whether to do this retrofit or not is inconclusive. For Finland, the results are inconclusive, other strategies may be equally suitable. Aspen Plus Simulation files and other source code have been open-sourced and are available to the reader."
717,Does environmental decentralization exacerbate China's carbon emissions? Evidence based on dynamic threshold effect analysis,"Ran, Qiying; Zhang, Jinning; Hao, Yu","As an institutional influential factor of environmental quality, environmental decentralization may play an important role in carbon emission control. Given China's rapid economic development and increasing environmental pollution, this study aims to investigate how environmental decentralization affects China's carbon emissions. Environmental decentralization indicators are reconstructed from the perspective of dynamic changes in the number of staff in environmental protection agencies on the basis of China's 30 provinces from 2005 to 2016. Spatial panel and dynamic threshold models are employed to investigate the impacts of environmental decentralization on carbon emissions. Results indicate that a remarkably positive spatial correlation is found in regional carbon emissions in China, and environmental decentralization has a positive impact on carbon emissions, suggesting that China's current environmental decentralization system may be unconducive to carbon emission control. Taking different environmental decentralization types as threshold variables, results from the dynamic threshold panel model show that environmental administrative decentralization and environmental monitoring decentralization have a positive threshold promoting effect on carbon emissions, whereas environmental supervision decentralization has a negative threshold inhibiting effect on carbon emissions. Therefore, the environmental administrative and monitoring power of local governments must be appropriately reduced and an environmental management mechanism must be developed for joint prevention and control to reduce carbon emissions.

718,Dynamic energy conversion and management strategy for an integrated electricity and natural gas system with renewable energy: Deep reinforcement learning approach,"Zhang, Bin; Hu, Weihao; Li, Jinghua; Cao, Di; Huang, Rui; Huang, Qi; Chen, Zhe; Blaabjerg, Frede","With the application of advanced information technology for the integration of electricity and natural gas systems, formulating an excellent energy conversion and management strategy has become an effective method to achieve established goals. Differing from previous works, this paper proposes a peak load shifting model to smooth the net load curve of an integrated electricity and natural gas system by coordinating the operations of the power-to-gas unit and generators. Moreover, the study aims to achieve multi-objective optimization while considering the economy of the system. A dynamic energy conversion and management strategy is proposed, which coordinates both the economic cost target and the peak load shifting target by adjusting an economic coefficient. To illustrate the complex energy conversion process, deep reinforcement learning is used to formulate the dynamic energy conversion and management problem as a discrete Markov decision process, and a deep deterministic policy gradient is adopted to solve the decision-making problem. By using the deep reinforcement learning method, the system operator can adaptively determine the conversion ratio of wind power, power-to-gas and gas turbine operations, and generator output through an online process, where the flexibility of wind power generation, wholesale gas price, and the uncertainties of energy demand are considered. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can increase the profit of the system operator, reduce wind power curtailment, and smooth the net load curves effectively in real time."
719,Adenosine signaling mediate pain transmission in the central nervous system,"Mengmeng Zhou,Jinrong Wu,Hongen Chang,Yuxin Fang,Di Zhang,Yi Guo,Mengmeng Zhou,Jinrong Wu,Hongen Chang,Yuxin Fang,Di Zhang,Yi Guo","Pain is a common clinical symptom that seriously affects the quality of life in a variety of patient populations. In recent years, research on the role of adenosine signaling in pain modulation has made great progress. Adenosine is a purine nucleoside and a neuromodulator, and regulates multiple physiological and pathophysiological functions through the activation of four G protein-coupled receptors, which are classified as A1, A2A, A2B, and A3 adenosine receptors (ARs). Adenosine and its receptors that are widespread in the central nervous system (CNS) play an important role in the processing of nociceptive sensory signals in different pain models. A1Rs have the highest affinity to adenosine, and the role in analgesia has been well investigated. The roles of A2ARs and A2BRs in the modulation of pain are controversial because they have both analgesic and pronociceptive effects. The analgesic effects of A3Rs are primarily manifested in neuropathic pain. In this article, we have reviewed the recent studies on ARs in the modulation of neuropathic pain, inflammatory pain, postoperative pain, and visceral pain in the CNS. Furthermore, we have outlined the pathways through which ARs contribute to pain regulation, thereby shedding light on how this mechanism can be targeted to provide effective pain relief."
720,Poisoning due to consumption of horse chestnut seed,"Hwa Yeon Yi,Jang Young Lee,Hwa Yeon Yi,Jang Young Lee","Horse chestnut (Aesculus hippocastanum) is a common tree found on roads and parks. The shape of the fruit is very similar to that of the edible Korean chestnut (Castanea crenata); thus, people can eat it by mistake. However, reports of the side effects and toxicity from ingestion are very rare. A 46-year-old male who had no unusual findings in the past had eaten horse chestnut seed which he had mistaken to be Korean chestnut. He visited the emergency department (ED) with complaints of epigastric pain, nausea, and sweating. Blood tests showed a slight increase in the levels of liver enzymes, serum amylase, and pancreatic amylase. During the monitoring, he complained of palpitations, and electrocardiogram showed atrial fibrillation. On the following day after conservative treatment, blood testing and electrocardiogram showed normal findings. He was discharged from the ED as he did not complain of any further symptoms. When a patient who has eaten horse chestnut visits the ED, blood examination and electrocardiogram monitoring are needed, and conservative treatment is required."
721,Comprehensive techno-economic and environmental sensitivity analysis and multi-objective optimization of a novel heat and power system for natural gas city gate stations,"Ebrahimi-Moghadam, Amir; Moghadam, Ali Jabari; Farzaneh-Gord, Mahmood","In the present study, a novel combined heat and power system is proposed to use in natural gas city gate stations. The proposed cogeneration system is used for power generation and satisfying heating requirements of the natural gas preheating in city gate stations. The system is composed of a regenerative gas turbine cycle, a heat exchanger and a Kalina cycle integrated with a city gate station heater. A comprehensive sensitivity analysis and single- and multi-objective optimizations are applied to investigate the system performance. The analysis is based on energetic, exergetic, environmental and economic standpoints which includes all important effective parameters (compressor presser ratio rCom, gas turbine inlet temperature T-GT, ammonia base concentration XNH3, condenser pinch point temperature difference DTPP;Con, ambient temperature T-amb and inlet NG pressure P-NG,P-in). Also, in addition to the energetic and exergetic efficiencies, a new performance criterion is defined as the system's annual costs to incomes ratio (this new function covers economic and environmental criteria simultaneously). The outputs of sensitivity analysis reveal that, rCom affects significantly on all of the three performance criteria; also, Tamb and PNG; in has the most impact on energetic efficiency. The exergetic analysis at the base system conditions shows that the combustion chamber has the maximum contribution in total exergy destruction with a share of 54.96%. This share is reduced by 3.65% in multi-objective optimization mode. Also, comparing the outputs of the base system and the multi-objective optimization mode for the proposed cogeneration system represents 30.72%, 3.48% and 10.55% improvement in energetic efficiency, exergetic efficiency and system's annual costs to incomes ratio, respectively.

722,"Chinese photovoltaic poverty alleviation: Geographic distribution, economic benefits and emission mitigation","Han, Mengyao; Xiong, Jiao; Wang, Siyuan; Yang, Yu","As a part of an environmentally concerned development strategy, the photovoltaic poverty alleviation in China is adopted to lift households above the rural extreme poverty line by the end of 2020. With the detailed project level data in 534 counties, 22 provinces, this systematic assessment on Chinese photovoltaic power projects identifies geographic distribution, economic benefits and emission mitigation for deployment distribution and policy implications. Overall, the photovoltaic installed capacity has reached 5213.37 MW, with the income generation of 7.41 billion CNY per year and the carbon emission mitigation of 5.98 million tons. From the results in this work, it is obvious that the GDP and household savings per capita in most counties and cities are lower than in those without photovoltaic poverty alleviation stations. As an essential strategy of generating income and mitigating emissions especially in countries well-endowed with sunlight, the deployment of photovoltaic power projects is consistent with sustainable development goals relating to global poverty eradication. With the assessments on the photovoltaic power stations, the initial implementation of photovoltaic poverty alleviation revealed a number of problems and solutions, which are practical for systematic deployment and policy implications of relevant photovoltaic power projects worldwide."
723,Simultaneous adsorption and oxidation of antimonite onto nano zero-valent iron sludge-based biochar: Indispensable role of reactive oxygen species and redox-active moieties,"Wei, Dongning; Li, Bingyu; Luo, Lin; Zheng, Yongxin; Huang, Liuhui; Zhang, Jiachao; Yang, Yuan; Huang, Hongli","The nano zero-valent iron sludge-based biochar (nZVI-SBC) was prepared in this study to eliminate Sb(III) from aqueous solutions, which was characterized by BET, SEM, XRD, TEM, FTIR, XPS. Our results proved that the incorporated nZVI on SBC matrix could significantly enhance eliminating Sb(III), and the max-adsorption capacity (160.40 mg g(-1)) can be achieved at pH = 4.8 +/- 0.2 and temperature of 298 K. The effect of co-existing anions and natural organic matters on the Sb(III) adsorption efficiencies were systematically investigated. The surface complexation is the possible adsorption mechanisms by FTIR and XPS. Furthermore, mechanistic investigation revealed that center dot OH and hydroquinone radical (H-SQ center dot(-)) could be the primary oxidants for the transformation of Sb(III) under oxic conditions, while 9,10-phenanthrene quinone radical (P-SQ center dot(-)) were responsible under anoxic conditions. Thus, the enhanced elimination of Sb(III) from aqueous solution was ascribed to the combined adsorption and oxidation. The potential engineering application of nZVI-SBC can be proved through three actual water matrix experiments, including lake water, river water and acid mine drainage. Our present findings proved that nZVI-SBC could be a potential adsorbent, given the excellent performance in the adsorption processes, as well as the toxicity alleviating ability and economic advantages, especially under subsurface water."
724,Introducing a hybrid renewable energy system for production of power and fresh water using parabolic trough solar collectors and LNG cold energy recovery,"Ghorbani, Bahram; Mahyari, Kimiya Borzoo; Mehrpooya, Mehdi; Hamedi, Mohammad-Hossein","In order to solve the water and energy crisis problem, the thermal water desalination and parabolic trough solar collectors are used at the cogeneration plants. In this paper, an integrated structure for cogeneration of fresh water and power has been developed using a multi-stage thermal water desalination system and organic Rankine cycle. In order to supply the input heat, an integrated structure of parabolic trough solar collectors, and to supply the condenser cooling of organic Rankine cycle, the re-gasification operations have been used. This integrated structure is capable of fresh water generation of 3628 kgmol/h and electrical power of 459.9 MW. In this integrated structure, the efficiency of the organic Rankine cycle power plant and gain output ratio of the multi effect desalination system is 12.47% and 2.918, respectively. Exergy analysis has been used to examine the second law of thermodynamics and the quality of the integrated structure. The total exergy efficiency of the integrated structure is 87.11%, and also, the highest share of equipment exergy destruction is related to the heat exchangers and collectors by 50.23% and 38.18%, respectively.

Weissella koreensis and Pediococcus inopinatus were the dominant species according to the NGS results, while Bacillus species and P. inopinatus were dominant in the culture-dependent analysis. To identify safe starter candidates, sixty-five Bacillus strains isolated from galchi-baechu kimchi using culture-dependent methods were evaluated for their antibiotic resistance, presence of toxin genes, and hemolytic activity. Strains were then assessed for salt tolerance and protease and lipase activity. As a result, four strains-B. safensis GN5_10, B. subtilis GN5_19, B. velezensis GN5_25, and B. velezensis GT8-were selected as safe starter candidates for use in fermented foods."

It has been detected in surface waters of agro-ecosystems, including wetlands, but the potential effects on non-target invertebrate communities in these wetlands have not been well characterized. In an effort to understand better the fate of thiamethoxam in wetlands and the response of invertebrates (zooplankton and emergent insects), model systems were used to mimic wetland flooding into planted fields. Outdoor mesocosms were treated with a single application of thiamethoxam-treated canola seeds at three treatment levels based on a recommended seeding rate (i.e., 6 kg/ha; 1×, 10×, and 100× seeding rate) and monitored over ten weeks. The mean half-life of thiamethoxam in the water column was 6.2 d. There was no ecologically meaningful impact on zooplankton abundances or community structure among treatments. Statistically significant differences were observed in aquatic insect abundance between control mesocosms and the two greatest thiamethoxam treatments (10× and 100× seeding rate). The observed results indicate exposure to thiamethoxam at environmentally relevant concentrations likely does not represent a significant ecological risk to abundance and community structure of wetland zooplankton and emergent insects."
727,"Recycling flowback water for hydraulic fracturing in Sichuan Basin, China: Implications for gas production, water footprint, and water quality of regenerated flowback water","Liu, Dan; Li, Jian; Zou, Caineng; Cui, Huiying; Ni, Yunyan; Liu, Jiaqi; Wu, Wei; Zhang, Lin; Coyte, Rachel; Kondash, Andrew; Vengosh, Avner","The increased water consumption for hydraulic fracturing and the volume of wastewater generated from shale gas and tight oil exploration are major environmental challenges associated with unconventional energy development. Recycling of the flowback and produced water for hydraulic fracturing is one of the solutions for reducing the water footprint of hydraulic fracturing and removing highly saline oil and gas wastewater. Here we investigated the implications of recycling saline wastewater for hydraulic fracturing by monitoring the natural gas production, flowback water volume, and the water quality of generated flowback water in shale gas wells from Changning gas field in Sichuan Basin, China. A comparison of two sets of shale gas wells, with six wells in each sub-group, from the same location in Changning gas field shows lower (similar to 20%) natural gas production and higher flowback water volume (similar to 18%) in wells that were fracked with recycled saline wastewater relative to wells that were fracked with fresh water after a year of production. Geochemical analysis suggests that hydraulic fracturing with saline wastewater increases the salinity of the wastewater and reduces the magnitude of watershale rock interactions. In spite of the direct economic consequences in reduction in natural gas production from recycling of wastewater for hydraulic fracturing, in areas where water scarcity could become a limiting factor for future large-scale shale gas development, hydraulic fracturing with recycled flowback water can be more beneficial than utilization of limited freshwater resources, as long as the higher saline flowback water is fully recycled."
728,Evaluation of ozonation applicability to pulp and paper streams for a sustainable wastewater treatment,"Mainardis, Matia; Buttazzoni, Marco; De Bortoli, Nicola; Mion, Michele; Goi, Daniele","Pulp and paper wastewater ozonation was tested at pilot-scale in a medium-potentiality wastewater treatment plant (143,000 population equivalent). Single wastewater lines (bleaching and process water), as well as wastewater mixture (before and after secondary biological treatment) were investigated to evaluate the best ozonation conditions. The aim of the work was to evaluate the feasibility of substituting current tertiary physicochemical treatment with an ozonation unit, reducing operating costs and improving management operations. The tests were useful to identify the ozone dosage required to achieve the desired COD abatement. Ozone effectiveness was more pronounced in process water (60% COD removal), rather than bleaching water (28% COD removal); ozone showed a significantly higher efficiency on pulp and paper wastewater mixture after biological treatment (up to 81% COD removal) rather than before biological process (46% mean COD abatement). COD removal efficiency at a dosage of 100 mg O-3/L was comparable to existing physicochemical treatment (mean 50%); a good TSS abatement (up to 20-30 mg/L) was observed as well. Toxicity analysis revealed that ozonation treatment did not modify treated effluent toxicity characteristics (mean Daphnia Magna mortality of 23.3%). Economic analysis proved that ozonation installation cost would be 1.5-2.0 M(sic), for total flowrate to be treated of 1200 m(3)/h. Ozonation would lead to an economic saving of about 300,000 (sic)/y compared to actual physicochemical treatment and the investment cost could be recovered in about 7 years. The proposed innovative approach, including plant analysis, pilot-ozonation tests, data regression, respirometric fractionation, toxicity and economic analysis, could be exported to other industrial wastewater treatment plants to allow an increased advanced oxidation processes diffusion.

729,Understanding spatial-temporal evolution of renewable energy technology innovation in China: Evidence from convergence analysis,"Bai, Caiquan; Feng, Chen; Du, Kerui; Wang, Yuansheng; Gong, Yuan","This paper constructs a knowledge-stock indicator to explore the trend of renewable energy technology innovation (RETI) levels across China's provinces during 1997-2015. First, the spatial-temporal evolution is analyzed. Second, the convergence characteristics and patterns are identified through the nonlinear time-varying factor model and the relative transition path curves. Third, the drivers of convergence behaviors are examined. The results are as follows: (i) China's RETI experienced a spurt of development. Its spatial pattern has changed significantly, and the average annual growth rate has also shown spatial differences; (ii) China's provincial RETI level was not converged as a whole during the sample period, but exhibited club convergence characteristics. The 30 provinces eventually converged to three clubs with large differences in average RETI level and annual growth rate; (iii) the provinces with a more optimized industrial structure, a greater R&D investment intensity, and a higher environmental regulation intensity tended to converge to the club with a higher innovation level and growth rate."
730,Asymmetric impact of renewable and non-renewable energy on economic growth in Pakistan: New evidence from a nonlinear analysis,"Abbasi, Kashif; Jiao, Zhilun; Shahbaz, Muhammad; Khan, Arman","This paper explores the asymmetric relationship between renewable energy consumption, non-renewable energy, and terrorism on economic growth of Pakistan. We applied a novel econometric cointegration method known as a nonlinear autoregressive distributed lag modeling (NARDL). Our empirical findings indicate that positive and negative changes have a significant long-run asymmetric relationship between renewable energy, and terrorism on economic growth. We also found a negative and significant effect of non-renewable energy consumption on economic growth. To keep our environment clean and free of emissions, the study specifies policies that rely on renewable energy sources to boost economic growth. However, reduces terrorism has a positive impact on economic growth in the long-run and shows as an influential tool to combat terrorism in Pakistan. These novel results will help policy-makers and government officials to understand better the role of renewable energy and economic growth in Pakistan's development."
731,Multi-Faceted Analysis of Systematic Risk-Based Wind Energy Investment Decisions in E7 Economies Using Modified Hybrid Modeling with IT2 Fuzzy Sets,"Qiu, Dejun; Dincer, Hasan; Yuksel, Serhat; Ubay, Gozde Gulseven","This study aimed to analyze the systematic risks of wind energy investments. Within this framework, E7 countries are included in the scope of the examination. A large literature review was carried out and 12 different systematic risk factors that could exist in wind energy investments were identified. The analysis process of the study consisted of two different stages. First, the specified risk criteria were weighted with the help of the interval type 2 (IT2) fuzzy decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL) method. Second, E7 countries were ranked according to the risk management effectiveness in wind energy investments. In this process, the IT2 fuzzy Vlsekriterijumska Optimizacija I Kompromisno Resenje (VIKOR) approach was taken into consideration. The findings show that volatility in exchange rates and interest rates were the most important risks in wind energy investments. In addition, it was determined that China and Indonesia were the most successful countries in managing risks in wind energy investments. In contrast, India, Russia, and Turkey were determined to be the least successful. Additionally, the IT2 fuzzy technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) method was applied as a robustness check of the extended VIKOR method. It was concluded that the ranking results of the IT2 fuzzy TOPSIS method were similar to the results of the IT2 fuzzy VIKOR. It can be understood that the proposed ranking method was consistent with the comparative analysis results. From this point of view, it was observed that countries should take measures regarding their exchange rate and interest rate risks in order to increase the efficiency in wind energy investments. In this context, companies should first ensure that they do not have a foreign exchange short position in their balance sheets by conducting an effective financial analysis. In addition, it is important to use financial derivatives to minimize the exchange rate and interest rate risks. Using these results, it will be possible to manage this risk by taking the reverse position for the existing foreign currency and interest risk. In this way, it will be possible to increase the efficiency of wind energy investments, which will contribute to the social and economic development of each respective country."

In an attempt to establish the number and types of court cases in which such arguments have been raised, the population of individual case records was accessed electronically from the Ordinary Courts Judgments Portal (Pol. Portal Orzeczeń Sądów Powszechnych). The analysed research material consists of texts of written justifications published along with rulings of courts of the first instance in the Portal, except for texts regarding criminal cases and widely understood labour cases. This paper refers to certain theoretical aspects of argument and argumentation. Then, it sheds light on the use of COVID-19 pandemic-related arguments by the parties involved in litigation-as reported by the courts in written justifications-considering, amongst others, whether those arguments were found convincing by the courts. Based on a survey of relevant cases, an attempt was made to identify categories of COVID-19 pandemic-related arguments of the parties involved in litigation, raised in their legal submissions. Also a look into the tendencies in this regard was taken to see whether any patterns emerge and it is possible (or not) to discern different trends in the analysed phenomena. The point of the analysis in this article is both descriptive and normative."
733,Alkali metals association in biomass and their impact on ash melting behaviour,"Mlonka-Medrala, Agata; Magdziarz, Aneta; Gajek, Marcin; Nowinska, Katarzyna; Nowak, Wojciech","Selected agricultural and energy crop biomass ashes represented by two mixed cereal straws, corn straw, Miscanthus x Gigantus and Salix Viminalis were chosen for ash behaviour investigation and prediction of operating problems during biomass combustion. The presence of aggressive species in the ash generate operational problems of heat exchanging surfaces in power boilers connected with slagging and fouling processes, limiting the use of biomass direct combustion for energy production. In this work, thermal behaviour characteristics, transformation properties of the inorganic components and ash fusion temperatures of biomass ashes were investigated using thermal analysis (STA), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and high-temperature microscope. The special attention was focused on the evaluation of potassium compounds presented in ashes. Potassium was detected as KCl, K2SO4, K2CO3 and K3PO4. It was noted, that presence and concentration of alkali metals, silicon and calcium compounds has the major impact on fusion temperatures of studied ashes. Leaching process of ash elements using water, ammonium acetate and hydrochloric acid solutions was performed to determine the association of alkali metals in the raw material. Based on the results, a mineral matter composition recalculation model was proposed to predict alkali compounds concentration in the fuel. The model might be also used to determine the risk of eutectics formation, which have the strongest influence on ash melting behaviour."
734,Coupling coordination analysis of urbanization and eco-environment in Yanqi Basin based on multi-source remote sensing data,"Ariken, Muhadaisi; Zhang, Fei; Liu, Kang; Fang, Chuangling; Kung, Hsiang-Te","While multi-source remote sensing technology has the advantage of accurate and objective quantification, an understanding of the coupling and coordination between regional urbanization and ecological environment is the basis for achieving regional sustainable development. This paper builds the Remote Sensing Ecological Index (RSEI) based on Landsat data and Tiangong-2 WIS, using multi-source remote sensing data to comprehensively evaluate the coupling and coordination relationship between urbanization and ecological environment with a coupling coordination degree model in China's typical arid area of Yanqin Basin during 2000-2018. The results show the RSEI index has a certain rationality and superiority in assessing the ecological environment. In 2000-2018, the ecological environment of the Yanqi Basin was optimized, the RSEI index increased by 23.06%, and the overall ecological environment was at a good level (0.6-0.8). At the same time, the urbanization level of each town had been significantly improved in Yanqi Basin. Through the urban center of gravity transfer model, it was found that direction of urban development shifted to the southwest direction by 7.49 km, which is basically consistent with the position of poor ecological environment. Finally the current urbanization and ecological environment coupling relationship in urban areas of Yanqi Basin was found to exhibit a sluggish rate of urbanization with a moderate imbalance between urbanization with ecological environment. Therefore, when making decisions for planning the regional economic development, the concept of ecological relationships should be integrated to effectively protect and achieve a healthy and sustainable development of the region."

In the present study, we explored the expression and functional relevance of hsa_circ_0003288 in human non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). We verified that hsa_circ_0003288 expression was upregulated in lung cancer tissues and cell lines. Overexpression of hsa_circ_0003288 dramatically promoted lung cancer cell proliferation, colony formation, inhibited apoptosis, and increased cell migration and invasion in vitro. Xenograft experiments showed that hsa_circ_0003288 overexpression accelerated tumor growth in vivo. Mechanistically, hsa_circ_0003288 negatively regulated miR-145 to exert the oncogenic role in lung cancer. Overexpression of miR-145 decreased cell proliferation, induced apoptosis, and suppressed migration and invasion in lung cancer. Additionally, miR-145 co-transfection abolished the oncogenic role of hsa_circ_0003288. Collectively, these findings identified a novel regulatory role of hsa_circ_0003288/miR-145 axis in the progression of NSCLC."

737,Evidence-based strategies to reduce the incidence of postoperative delirium: a narrative review,"C J Swarbrick,J S L Partridge,C J Swarbrick,J S L Partridge","Delirium is one of the most commonly occurring postoperative complications in older adults. It occurs due to the vulnerability of cerebral functioning to pathophysiological stressors. Identification of those at increased risk of developing delirium early in the surgical pathway provides an opportunity for modification of predisposing and precipitating risk factors and effective shared decision-making. No single delirium prediction tool is used widely in surgical settings. Multi-component interventions to prevent delirium involve structured risk factor modification supported by geriatrician input; these are clinically efficacious and cost effective. Barriers to the widespread implementation of such complex interventions exist, resulting in an 'implementation gap'. There is a lack of evidence for pharmacological prophylaxis for the prevention of delirium. Current evidence suggests that avoidance of peri-operative benzodiazepines, careful titration of anaesthetic depth guided by processed electroencephalogram monitoring and treatment of pain are the most effective strategies to minimise the risk of delirium. Addressing postoperative delirium requires a collaborative, whole pathway approach, beginning with the early identification of those patients who are at risk. The research agenda should continue to examine the potential for pharmacological prophylaxis to prevent delirium while also addressing how successful models of delirium prevention can be translated from one setting to another, underpinned by implementation science methodology."
738,Testicular torsions in veterinary medicine,"Abbas Raisi,Farshid Davoodi,Abbas Raisi,Farshid Davoodi","The purpose of this review is to provide a comprehensive comparison of spermatic cord torsion in domestic animals. Spermatic cord torsion leads to occlusion of testicular blood flow resulting in ischemia and tissue hypoxia. Spermatic cord torsion has been reported in all domestic mammals but dogs and horses are overrepresented. Abdominal pain (colic), anorexia, vomiting, lameness, and stiff gait are the most common clinical signs reported. The condition may be asymptomatic in cases of a low degree of spermatic cord torsion. In dogs, spermatic cord torsion is most commonly reported in undescended testes, which in some cases are neoplastic. However, in horses, spermatic cord torsion occurs more commonly in scrotal testes. Surgical treatment for spermatic cord torsion depends upon the degree and duration of torsion. If the affected testis is located within the scrotum and determined to still be viable, detorsion with orchidopexy can be performed. Orchiopexy of the unaffected scrotal testis is also recommended in stallions. If the affected testis cannot be salvaged, unilateral or bilateral orchidectomy is recommended. In all cases of spermatic cord torsion of an undescended testis, orchidectomy is recommended. Veterinarians should be aware of the clinical signs and treatment options for spermatic cord torsion in domestic mammals."

Seventy five chicks with age one day old were splitted randomly into five groups equally in distribution with fifteen chick in each group. Group I was untreated unvaccinated (control negative group) while group IV was infected group with NDV (control positive group). The experimental Groups II and V were given daily oral treatment of hydrophilic alcoholic leaves extract of M. oleifera at 200 mg/kg body weight until day 21 of age while groups III and V were ND vaccinated with La Sota strain of ND vaccines. The four groups (II, III, IV, V) were infected with ND virus velogenic strain (VNDV) on day 21. Following to infection, Monitoring of birds were done daily for clinical signs, postmortem examination, morbidity and mortality. Cellular, humeral immune response and phagocytic activity were evaluated and the data were statistically analyzed using (SPSS). Total and differential cell numbers as well as Haemagglutination inhibition (HI) titre increased in the extract treated and vaccinated group which give total protection against NDV much more than treated and unvaccinated group. As a result it could be recommended to use M. Olifera extract from the first day of rearing in Hubbard chicken with ND vaccination program as a prophylactic treatment in protection of birds against ND infection."

Outcomes are likely to be improved by rapid and accurate diagnosis, and early intervention The development of high-sensitivity troponin assays has revealed previously unrecognised types of myocardial injury, for which conventional management guidelines for myocardial infarction may not confer similar benefits. The distinction between myocardial injury and myocardial infarction has therefore become increasingly important Once the diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction has been made, individualised acute reperfusion strategies including percutaneous coronary intervention or fibrinolytic therapy should be considered. Secondary prevention strategies should be implemented before hospital discharge."

Thus, in developing strategic plans for economic growth, many governments consider the application of green manufacturing building and technologies as key factors towards a greener economy and lower carbon emission. However, so far, there have been limited efforts relating to the application of eco-efficiency ideas in building manufacturing. In fact, environmental sustainability in building project and delivery is still at a nascent stage. Thus, this study aims to identify and rank the sustainability indicators for assessing green building manufacturing in Malaysia by considering Green Building Index (GBI), which is the most applied sustainability rating tool in the country. Data is collected from a panel of experts and fuzzy Decision-Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL) is performed to reveal the importance level and relationships among sustainability indicators in green building manufacturing.

742,A comparison of steam and oxygen fed biomass gasification through a techno-economic-environmental study,"AlNouss, Ahmed; McKay, Gordon; Al-Ansari, Tareq","Economically, fossil fuels remain the main source of energy despite their high emissions of greenhouse gases. However, biomass, a renewable fuel with CO2 neutrality, has experienced widespread attention as a potential contributor to sustainable development of the energy sector. Gasification is an important thermochemical process that converts biomass feedstock into H-2-rich combustible gases, which are favoured by wide downstream applications. The use of pure steam or oxygen as a gasifying agent is preferred to increase the yield of combustible gases. Consequently, hydrogen is utilised as an important intermediary in the generation of value-added products such as urea, fuels and power. This study compares the biomass gasification using oxygen-only and steam-only gasifying agents. Moreover, the study examines a poly-generation system that consumes biomass feedstock of multiple sources to produce high grade Fisher-Tropsch liquids, methanol, urea, and power. To achieve this aim, four Aspen Plus simulation flowsheets are developed considering both gasifiying agents and compared utilising the built-in economic and environmental capabilities. The results obtained from the economic and environmental evaluation demonstrate the excellence of steam-only biomass gasification in providing profitable and cleaner products. The methanol production using steam gasification is the most economical solution with a net profit per input of $0.12 per kg of biomass input and the lowest emissions pathway with 0.68 kg of CO2-e per biomass input. The relative nature of the results can offer diverse perspectives depending on the market situation of the products. Consequently, analysing the results relative to production capacity, power generation using steam gasification achieves a net profit approximated at $0.80 per kg of product, whilst methanol production using steam gasification remains the lowest environmental impact solution with 2.32 kg of CO2-e per output product."
743,Association of dietary patterns with obesity and metabolically healthy obesity phenotype in Chinese population: a cross-sectional analysis of China Multi-Ethnic Cohort Study,"Dan Tang,Xiong Xiao,Liling Chen,Yixi Kangzhu,Wei Deng,Basang,Shujuan Yang,Lu Long,Xiaofen Xie,Jiaojiao Lu,Qun Meng,Jianzhong Yin,Feng Hong,Xing Zhao,Dan Tang,Xiong Xiao,Liling Chen,Yixi Kangzhu,Wei Deng,Basang,Shujuan Yang,Lu Long,Xiaofen Xie,Jiaojiao Lu,Qun Meng,Jianzhong Yin,Feng Hong,Xing Zhao","Metabolically healthy obesity (MHO) might be an alternative valuable target in obesity treatment. We aimed to assess whether alternative Mediterranean (aMED) diet and Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet were favourably associated with obesity and MHO phenotype in a Chinese multi-ethnic population. We conducted this cross-sectional analysis using the baseline data of the China Multi-Ethnic Cohort study that enrolled 99 556 participants from seven diverse ethnic groups. Participants with self-reported cardiometabolic diseases were excluded to eliminate possible reverse causality. Marginal structural logistic models were used to estimate the associations, with confounders determined by directed acyclic graph (DAG). Among 65 699 included participants, 11·2 % were with obesity. MHO phenotype was present in 5·7 % of total population and 52·7 % of population with obesity. Compared with the lowest quintile, the highest quintile of DASH diet score had 23 % decreased odds of obesity (OR = 0·77, 95 % CI 0·71, 0·83, Ptrend < 0·001) and 27 % increased odds of MHO (OR = 1·27, 95 % CI 1·10, 1·48, Ptrend = 0·001) in population with obesity. However, aMED diet showed no obvious favourable associations. Further adjusting for BMI did not change the associations between diet scores and MHO. Results were robust to various sensitivity analyses. In conclusion, DASH diet rather than aMED diet is associated with reduced risk of obesity and presents BMI-independent metabolic benefits in this large population-based study. Recommendation for adhering to DASH diet may benefit the prevention of obesity and related metabolic disorders in Chinese population."
744,Comprehensive evaluation of national electric power development based on cloud model and entropy method and TOPSIS: A case study in 11 countries,"Zhao, Defu; Li, Cunbin; Wang, Qiqing; Yuan, Jiahai","Electric power is the foundation of the development of national economy, it is necessary to make a comprehensive evaluation of its development. Firstly, 17 secondary electric power development evaluation indexes are established from four aspects: electricity supply, electricity consumption, electrification level and carbon emission. Secondly, based on the cloud model, the subjective evaluation and analysis of the primary evaluation index for the national electric power development are realized. Then, the entropy method is used to objectively evaluate and analyze the secondary evaluation index of national electric power development. And the objective evaluation value of the primary evaluation index for the national electric power development is obtained. Thirdly, the TOPSIS method is used to integrate the subjective evaluation value obtained by the cloud model and the objective evaluation value obtained by the entropy method to comprehensively evaluate the status of national electricity development. Next, by collecting the electric power development evaluation index data of 11 typical countries, the electric power development of 11 countries was evaluated and analyzed by using the CM-EM-TOPSIS method proposed in this paper. From the results of the comprehensive evaluation of China's electric power development, it is found that compared with other countries, the sensitivity of the queueing indicator value to the subjective evaluation weight is lower in China. Finally, according to the results of comprehensive evaluation and analysis of electric power development, the managerial implication is explored in China. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."

In this study, we measured Kyn and other related molecules in the blood plasma, brain, and urine of male C57BL/6J mice (B6) fed non-purified (MF) and semi-purified (AIN-93G and AIN-93M) standard rodent diets. Mice fed MF had increased plasma Kyn levels compared with those on AIN93-based diets, as well as decreased hippocampal Kyn levels compared with those fed AIN-93G. Previous studies showed that branched chain amino acids (BCAAs) suppress peripheral blood Kyn transportation to the brain, but plasma BCAA levels were not significantly different between the diet groups in our study. Urine metabolome analysis revealed that feed ingredients affected the excretion of many metabolites, and MF-fed mice had elevated excretion of kynurenic and quinolinic acids, pivotal metabolites in the Kyn pathway. Collectively, the level of critical metabolites in the Kyn pathway in the central and peripheral tissues was strongly affected by feed ingredients. Therefore, feed selection is a critical factor to ensure the reproducibility of experimental data in studies involving rodent models."
746,Formulation and development of novel control release transdermal patches of carvedilol to improve bioavailability for the treatment of heart failure,"Long Mo,Guijing Lu,Xiping Ou,Dongsheng Ouyang,Long Mo,Guijing Lu,Xiping Ou,Dongsheng Ouyang","The main aim of this study is to optimize and evaluate transdermal patch of Carvedilol by the use of different polymer and different permeation enhancers which help to release drug in controlled action and thereby increase the bioavailability of the drug. Main objective was to avoid first pass metabolism of Carvedilol. Transdermal patches were developed by solvent evaporation method. The combination of Eudragit RS-100 as rate controlling polymer and Span 80 as a permeation enhancer was found to be ideal formulation (Formulation F7) with maximum drug release i.e. 100.29 ± 0.44 % within 12 h.

747,"Epidemiologic Trends, Social Determinants, and Brain Health: The Role of Life Course Inequalities","Saima Hilal,Carol Brayne,Saima Hilal,Carol Brayne","Brain health as expressed in our mental health and occurrence of specific disorders such as dementia and stroke is vitally important to quality of life, functional independence, and risk of institutionalization. Maintaining brain health is, therefore, a societal imperative, and public health challenge, from prevention of acquisition of brain disorders, through protection and risk reduction to supporting those with such disorders through effective societal and system approaches. To identify possible mechanisms that explain the differential effect of potentially modifiable risk factors, and factors that may mitigate risk, a life course approach is needed. This is key to understanding how poor health can accumulate from the earliest life stages. It also allows us to integrate and investigate key material, behavioral, and psychological factors that generate health inequalities within and across communities and societies. This review provides a narrative on how brain health is intimately linked to wider health determinants, thus importance for clinicians and societies alike. There is compelling evidence accumulated from research over decades that socioeconomic status, higher education, and healthy lifestyle extend life and compress major morbidities into later life. Brain health is part of this, but collective action has been limited, partly because of the separation of disciplines and focus on highly reductionist approaches in that clinicians and associated research have focused more on mitigation and early detection of specific diseases. However, clinicians could be part of the drive for better brain health for all society to support life courses that have more protection and less risk. There is evidence of change in such risks for conditions such as stroke and dementia across generations. The evidence points to the importance of starting with parental health and life course inequalities as a central focus."
748,"Mould growth in energy efficient buildings: Causes, health implications and strategies to mitigate the risk","Brambilla, Arianna; Sangiorgio, Alberto","Today, buildings still account for almost half of the global energy consumption and carbon emission. This highlights the necessity to increase energy efficiency requirements worldwide in a common effort to reduce the construction sector's impacts on the environment. The current energy policies are driving toward a design that relies on airtight and highly insulated envelopes. As a consequence, energy efficient houses are found to have insufficient indoor air change rates, impacting on the indoor air quality and resulting in higher latent loads. The increased indoor humidity, coupled with the rising trend to use bio-based construction materials, can easily support mould growth and facilitate indoor organic proliferation. It has been estimated that the proportion of buildings damaged by mould is 45% in Europe, 40% in the USA, 30% in Canada and 50% in Australia, highlighting the extent of this issue. Beyond the economic loss due to the remediation works needed to rectify a buildings degradation due to fungi, mould also has significant adverse health effects on the building occupants. Data show that the occurrence of asthmatic symptoms is higher in new energy efficient buildings with low ventilation rate. This paper investigates the effects of building sustainably on the indoor environment in relation to the risk of mould growth. Favourable conditions for growth, causes of growth, effects on health as well as possible solutions are addressed. The conclusions are a step forward toward a more precise and detailed comprehension of mould growth to support policymakers and promote sustainable housing standards."

750,"Financial development, income inequality and carbon emissions in sub-Saharan African countries: A panel data analysis","Odhiambo, Nicholas M.","This paper examines the dynamic relationship between financial development, income inequality and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions in a step-wise fashion, using data from 39 sub-Saharan African (SSA) countries during the period 2004-2014. The study uses three income inequality indicators - the Gini coefficient, the Atkinson index and the Palma ratio - to examine these linkages. The study employs the generalised method of moments as the estimation technique. The empirical findings show that financial development unconditionally reduces CO(2)emissions in SSA countries. The findings also show that there are threshold levels of income inequality that should not be exceeded in order for the negative impact of financial development on CO(2)emissions to be sustained. Specifically, the study finds that the negative impact of financial development on CO(2)emissions is likely to change to positive if the following inequality levels are exceeded: 0.591, 0.662 and 5.59, respectively, for the Gini coefficient, the Atkinson index and the Palma ratio. The findings of this study have far-reaching policy implications not only for SSA countries but also for developing countries as a whole. Policy implications are discussed."

However, no studies have investigated respiratory ""heat shock"" in response to noxious acute heat stimuli (≥ 42 °C).Methods: In the present study, we examined whether short-duration whole-body immersion (for 5 min) in noxious hot water (45 °C) is a sufficient stimulus to induce a respiratory acute shock response.Results and conclusion: Our results indicate that short-duration whole-body immersion in noxious 45 °C water produces a significantly greater body temperature, heart rate, and perceptual and respiratory strain than immersion in innocuous warm 37 °C water (p < .05). The initial first minute of hot water immersion (HWI) at 45 °C (vs. immersion at 37 °C) caused a cardiorespiratory shock response, which manifested as acute hyperventilation, and increased ventilatory tidal volume, respiratory exchange ratio, and heart rate (p < .05). Adjustment to this initial respiratory heat shock response within the first minute of immersion was observed as compared with remaining HWI time (1-5 min). Intriguingly, the time-course kinetics of breathing frequency, oxygen uptake, and carbon dioxide washout did not differ between whole-body immersion at 37 °C and immersion at 45 °C, but were higher than in control thermoneutral conditions of an empty bath (p < .05). This may be because of events initiated not only by the water temperature but also by the change in the hydrostatic pressure acting upon the body when immersed in the water bath."
752,The role of E2A in ATPR-induced cell differentiation and cycle arrest in acute myeloid leukaemia cells,"Meiju Zhang,Long-Fei Wang,Xiaoling Xu,Yan Du,Lanlan Li,Ge Deng,Yubin Feng,Ziyao Ou,Ke Wang,Yayun Xu,Xiaoqing Peng,Feihu Chen,Meiju Zhang,Long-Fei Wang,Xiaoling Xu,Yan Du,Lanlan Li,Ge Deng,Yubin Feng,Ziyao Ou,Ke Wang,Yayun Xu,Xiaoqing Peng,Feihu Chen","Acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) is a biologically heterogeneous disease with an overall poor prognosis; thus, novel therapeutic approaches are needed. Our previous studies showed that 4-amino-2-trifluoromethyl-phenyl retinate (ATPR), a new derivative of all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA), could induce AML cell differentiation and cycle arrest. The current study aimed to determine the potential pharmacological mechanisms of ATPR therapies against AML. Our findings showed that E2A was overexpressed in AML specimens and cell lines, and mediate AML development by inactivating the P53 pathway. The findings indicated that E2A expression and activity decreased with ATPR treatment. Furthermore, we determined that E2A inhibition could enhance the effect of ATPR-induced AML cell differentiation and cycle arrest, whereas E2A overexpression could reverse this effect, suggesting that the E2A gene plays a crucial role in AML. We identified P53 and c-Myc were downstream pathways and targets for silencing E2A cells using RNA sequencing, which are involved in the progression of AML. Taken together, these results confirmed that ATPR inhibited the expression of E2A/c-Myc, which led to the activation of the P53 pathway, and induced cell differentiation and cycle arrest in AML."

A homogeneous population of cells predictably and uniformly responds to external factors. In a heterogeneous cell population, the effect of external growth factors is perceived in the context of intercellular interactions. Indirect cell cocultivation allows one to observe the paracrine effects of cells and separately analyze cell populations. The article describes an application of custom-made cell cocultivation systems based on protein membranes separated from the bottom of the vessel by the 3D printed holder or kept afloat by a magnetic field. Using the proposed cocultivation system, we analyzed the interaction of A549 cells and fibroblasts, in the presence and absence of growth factors. During cocultivation of cells, the expression of genes of the activation for epithelial and mesenchymal transitions decreases. The article proposes the application of a newly available system for the cocultivation of different cell types."
754,Linking international trade and foreign direct investment to CO2 emissions: Any differences between developed and developing countries?,"Essandoh, Obed Kwame; Islam, Moinul; Kakinaka, Makoto","International trade, together with foreign direct investment (FDI), promotes economic integration with complex global supply value chains, which is now recognized as a crucial factor in determining CO2 emissions. Production reallocation across countries, often associated with FDI, promotes cross-border trade of emission-embodied products. By applying panel pooled mean group-autoregressive distributive lag (PMG-ARDL) models, this study discusses the long-run relevance among CO2 emissions, international trade, and FDI inflows with the consideration of the short-run dynamics over 52 countries during the period from 1991 to 2014. Focusing on possible differences between developed and the developing countries, this study reveals that CO2 emissions have a negative long-run relationship with trade exclusively for developed countries, while they have a positive long-run relationship with FDI inflows solely for developing countries. The recent trend of increased trade and FDI would promote the transfer of high emission-intensive production units from developed countries to developing countries, causing developed countries to achieve emission reduction at the expense of developing countries.

We selected six major industrial sectors (agriculture, industry, construction, transportation, retail and accommodation and other industries) as research objects, introduced the extended STIRPAT decomposition model, Tapio decoupling model and the grey relation analysis to discuss the relationship among the three. Results showed that (i) since 2000, the proportions of value added of agriculture, manufacturing, and transportation are negatively correlated with carbon emissions, while those of construction, retail and accommodation, and other industries are positively correlated with carbon emissions. (ii) The overall economic growth and carbon emissions of these six major industries have experienced the process of decoupling-coupling-decoupling-coupling-decoupling. (iii) The relevance of these six industries to GDP is ranked as follows: transportation > manufacturing > retail andaccommodation > agriculture > construction > other industries. Additionally, accelerating the achievement of a clean energy structure, strengthening the strength and speed of industrial structure adjustment and reducing the dependence on fossil energy are the key steps for China to reach carbon emissions peak goal.

Although many studies have been performed in the adult population, reports in children are scarce. Our objective was to determine the most common neurologic complications in a pediatric population and to analyze possible risk factors for their development. We performed an exploratory retrospective study of neurologic complications in pediatric patients who had allogeneic stem cell transplantation over the last 18 years. We identified 66 neurologic complications in 178 allogeneic stem cell transplantations. The most frequent neurologic complications were those involving the peripheral nervous system and those related to drug toxicity. Survival decreased significantly in the presence of neurologic complications. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that independent risk factors for developing neurologic complications were development of chronic extensive graft-vs-host disease requiring treatment, cytomegalovirus reactivation, and central nervous system radiation. Prompt diagnosis and preemptive treatment, if possible, are necessary to avoid long-term sequelae or mortality."
757,Recent advances in lipid extraction using green solvents,"de Jesus, Sergio S.; Maciel Filho, Rubens","Green solvents are a new class of solvents mostly known for being environmentally friendly. The main green solvents besides water are organic-based solvents, some ionic liquids (including deep eutectic solvents) and CO2, which is typically used in supercritical conditions (SC-CO2). Recently, organic-based solvents and ionic liquids have been subjected to laboratory testing to estimate their potential as substitutes for fossil solvents in the process of lipid extraction. In the last decade, different pure or combined green solvents and different methodologies have been studied and compared with the standard methodology. Cell disruption of animal, vegetable or microbial samples, dry or wet, is a previous step that has been studied many times in association with extraction efficiency. Combined techniques of rupture and extraction using ultrasound, microwaves or maceration were also employed in the extraction process with green solvents. Other techniques such as pressurized liquid extraction and simultaneous distillation and extraction were also applied, sometimes not only with the objective of extracting more, but also of purifying the obtained product. Lipid extraction was performed mainly with the organic solvents cyclopentyl methyl ether and 2-methyltetrahydrofuran, while ionic liquid extractions were performed mainly with imidazolium-based ionic liquids. The advances obtained in this decade in lipid extraction using these three classes of green solvents were studied and evaluated in this review. Economic viability and future challenges were also analyzed with a view to using these solvents in extraction processes on an industrial scale rather than restricted to the extraction of products with high biological value."
758,Preparation of a new low-cost substrate prepared from drinking water treatment sludge (DWTS)/bentonite/zeolite/fly ash for rapid phosphorus removal in constructed wetlands,"Gao, Jingqing; Zhao, Jie; Zhang, Jingshen; Li, Qiang; Gao, Jianlei; Cai, Ming; Zhang, Jinliang","With the increase of tap water demand and treatment volume, the by-product of the water supply plant-drinking water treatment sludge (DWTS) is increasing, and its final disposal urgently needs to be reasonably resolved. Therefore, the reuse of DWTS can not only solve the ""waste"" problem but also generate favorable economic benefits. This is the first study to use DWTS to prepare a regular, industrialized and efficient DWTS composite substrate (DWTSCS) for phosphorus removal in constructed wetlands by using DWTS as the main material and bentonite, zeolite and fly ash as the additive. The optimal weight ratio of DWTSCS was determined by combining orthogonal test and mixture design experiments: cement = 22.32%, DWTS = 51.62%, bentonite = 13.03%, zeolite = 4.34%, fly ash = 8.69%. The microstructure and phase analysis were performed using SEM and XRD. The static adsorption experiments showed that the adsorption behavior of DWTSCS to phosphorus conforms to a quasi-second-order kinetic model and the adsorption process can be simulated using Langmuir and Freundlich models. The maximum adsorption capacity of phosphorus by DWTSCS was calculated as 40 mg/g, and the adsorption of phosphorus with the DWTSCS was a spontaneous exothermic process. Under acidic conditions, it was favorable for DWTSCS to adsorbed phosphorus. The concentration of adsorbed phosphorus with the DWTSCS ranged from 0.5 mg/L to 0.2 mg/L. This research provides a basis for the application of DWTSCSs in constructed wetlands. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."

Quantifying pesticide overuse in vegetable production in Southeast Asia,"Schreinemachers, Pepijn; Grovermann, Christian; Praneetvatakul, Suwanna; Heng, Phearun; Thi Tan Loc Nguyen; Buntong, Borarin; Nhu Thinh Le; Pinn, Thira","This paper quantifies the extent of pesticide overuse in vegetable production systems in Southeast Asia. Pesticide overuse was defined as levels of use in excess of an economic (profit-maximizing) optimum. A production function with an exponential damage abatement term was estimated. Data come from a representative sample of 1000 farmers producing leaf mustard and yard-long bean in Cambodia, Laos and Vietnam. The results show that 100% of the sampled farmers in Vietnam, 73% in Cambodia and 59% in Laos overused pesticides. Pesticide expenditure in excess of the economic optimum was 96% for Vietnam, 92% for Cambodia, and 42% for Laos. Pesticide overuse was positively associated with men in charge of pest management decisions, farmers seeking advice from pesticide sellers and a strong belief that pesticides are effective. It was negatively associated with the use of non-chemical methods of pest control. These results imply that farmers in Southeast Asia are spraying excessively and inefficiently and could increase their profits by applying fewer pesticides. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper uses the DEA-BCC model to estimate China's energy efficiency at the provincial level, analyzes its regional differences from 2006 to 2016, and applies a panel data model to analyze the influencing factors of energy efficiency. It selects labor, capital stock and total energy consumption as inputs and takes real GDP and comprehensive index of environmental pollution as desirable and undesirable outputs, respectively. The results show that (1) energy efficiency when undesirable output is included is generally lower than when undesirable output is excluded; (2) There is a considerable difference in energy efficiency among provinces, and China's energy efficiency, by and large, shows a trend of declining. The energy efficiency of four major regions demonstrates obvious regional differences: coastal region>northeastern region> middle region >western region; (3) The economic development level, technological progress, energy price and urbanization level are positively associated with energy efficiency, while the proportion of secondary industry and the energy consumption structure dominated by coal and oil are negatively correlated with energy efficiency.

M. gallisepticum has only two known nucleoid-associated (NAP) histone-like proteins (Hup_1 and Hup_2). To search for new potential NAP that may play a role in the infection process, we isolated nucleoid fractions from M. gallisepticum cells before and after infection of HD3 chicken erythroblast cell line and performed a comparative proteomic analysis of these fractions. We identified several potential NAP that included the components of the terminal organelle and adhesion, VlhA antigen, NADH oxidase, and PykF pyruvate kinase."

The outcomes of the Bayer-Hanck cointegration test show that there is an important cointegration equation among CO2 emissions, innovation, financial development, transportation infrastructure, and real GDP. Moreover, the findings from a wavelet power spectrum reveal that there is a significant vulnerability in innovation, financial development, transportation infrastructure, and CO2 emissions at different time frames and frequencies. Furthermore, the outcomes of wavelet coherence approach reveal that (i) Innovation is observed as a significant predictor of CO2 emissions over the period from 2007 to 2013; (ii) In the long run, there are negative correlations between CO2 emissions and financial development; (iii) Over the periods from 2000 to 2015, and from 1985 to 1989, transportation significantly causes CO2 emissions. Our findings have substantial policy implications that suggest there is a need to strengthen innovation and transportation infrastructure to achieve environmental sustainability targets."

Although several attempts have been made to investigate the impact of globalization on the environment, no known empirical research has focused on exploring the causal relationship between ecological footprint and economic globalization index (provided by KOF Swiss Economic Institute) considering also its subcomponents-trade and financial globalization indices. In this study, a new panel data technique for the causality analysis is developed (namely, panel Fourier Toda-Yamamoto approach) and applied to ecological footprint-economic globalization nexus in 14 MENA (Middle East and North Africa) countries during the period 1981-2016. The empirical results highlight that ecological footprint Granger causes economic, trade, and financial globalization for the panel. Besides, it is found that financial globalization has a predictive power to predict further values of environmental degradation in the MENA countries. The empirical results of this paper have a number of practical implications for policymakers. Especially, policymakers should be careful about implementing environmental policies since they may affect economic (trade and financial) activities negatively."
766,Protease Inhibitors from Plants as Therapeutic Agents- A Review,"M S Cid-Gallegos,L J Corzo-Ríos,C Jiménez-Martínez,X M Sánchez-Chino,M S Cid-Gallegos,L J Corzo-Ríos,C Jiménez-Martínez,X M Sánchez-Chino","Plant-based diets are a great source of protease inhibitors (PIs). Two of the most well-known families of PIs are Bowman-Birk inhibitors (BBI) and Kunitz-type inhibitors (KTI). The first group acts mainly on trypsin, chymotrypsin, and elastase; the second is on serine, cysteine, and aspartic proteases. PIs can retard or inhibit the catalytic action of enzymes; therefore, they are considered non-nutritional compounds; nevertheless, animal studies and cell line experiments showed promising results of PIs in treating human illnesses such as obesity, cardiovascular diseases, autoimmune diseases, inflammatory processes, and different types of cancer (gastric, colorectal, breast, and lung cancer). Anticarcinogenic activity's proposed mechanisms of action comprise several inhibitory effects at different molecular levels, i.e., transcription, post-transcription, translation, post-translation, and secretion of cancer cells. This work reviews the potential therapeutic applications of PIs as anticarcinogenic and anti-inflammatory agents in human diseases and the mechanisms by which they exert these effects."
767,When Is an Interview an Inter View? The Historical and Recent Development of Methodologies Used to Investigate Children's Astronomy Knowledge,"Eric J Blown,Tom G K Bryce,Eric J Blown,Tom G K Bryce","This paper provides a historical review of the interview research that has been used by science educators to investigate children's basic astronomy knowledge. A wide range of strategies have been developed over the last 120 years or so as successive teams of researchers have endeavoured to overcome the methodological difficulties that have arisen. Hence, it looks critically at the techniques that have been developed to tackle the problems associated with interviews, questionnaires and tests used to research cognitive development and knowledge acquisition. We examine those methodologies which seem to yield surer indications of how young people (at different ages) understand everyday astronomical phenomena-the field often referred to as children's cosmologies. Theoretical ideas from cognitive psychology, educational instruction and neuroscience are examined in depth and utilised to critique matters such as the importance of subject mastery and pedagogical content knowledge on the part of interviewers; the merits of multi-media techniques; the roles of open-ended vs. structured methods of interviewing; and the need always to recognise the dynamism of memory in interviewees. With illustrations and protocol excerpts drawn from recent studies, the paper points to what researchers might usefully tackle in the years ahead and the pitfalls to be avoided."
768,Effects of foreign direct investment on carbon emissions: Evidence from China and its Belt and Road countries,"Mahadevan, Renuka; Sun, Yanyan",This paper examines the effects of China's foreign direct investment (FDI) on the carbon emissions of its domestic economy and the Belt and Road countries (BRCs). Total inward FDI into China as a host country shows a pollution reducing effect in the western and eastern regions while that in the central region remains unchanged. But China's outward FDI particularly from its eastern region reduces pollution in China. This suggests that China could be exporting carbon emissions via its FDI in the BRCs. The effects on BRCs' pollution from China's FDI is however different depending on the country's level of development. China's FDI was found to have no effect on high and upper middle income BRCs; a decreasing effect on low income BRCs; and an increasing effect on lower middle income BRCs. Evidence shows that China needs to consider a mix of policies to manage its inward and outward FDI to ensure its move to a low carbon economy benefits its own regional development and the BRCs by not contributing to increased carbon emissions.
769,Analysis of electricity generation options for sustainable energy decision making: The case of Turkey,"Yilan, Gulsah; Kadirgan, M. A. Neset; Ciftcioglu, Gokcen A.","Sustainable energy decision making requires the comparison of energy generation technologies regarding a wide range of economic, technical, environmental, and socio-economic criteria. This study aims to rank the main seven electricity generation technologies for Turkey according to their performance scores. These energy generation technologies are natural gas, coal, hydropower with dam, run-of-river type hydropower, onshore wind, geothermal and solar PV. The sustainability scores are calculated via twelve indicators classified into abovementioned four criteria groups. Multi-criteria decision analysis methodology is employed with a weighted sum multi-attribute utility approach for five different sensitivity cases. The results reveal that the hydroelectric technology with dam is the best option for most of the sensitivity cases. We hope this study gives a scientific and objective standpoint to decision-maker authorities in Turkey for planning sustainable electricity generation policies. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

770,Dual-effect single-mixed refrigeration cycle: An innovative alternative process for energy-efficient and cost-effective natural gas liquefaction,"Qyyum, Muhammad Abdul; He, Tianbiao; Qadeer, Kinza; Mao, Ning; Lee, Sanggyu; Lee, Moonyong","Typical liquefaction processes are considered to be energy and cost-intensive. The dual mixed refrigerant (DMR) process (with two independent refrigeration cycles for cooling and subcooling) produces liquefied natural gas (LNG) at relatively high energy efficiency. However, it exhibits a high degree of configurational complexity and high sensitivity to operational conditions, and it also incurs a large capital investment. These factors eventually reduce the overall competitiveness of the liquefaction process, particularly for offshore applications. To address these issues, an energy- and cost-efficient dual-effect single mixed refrigerant (DSMR) process is proposed herein, and it employs a single loop refrigeration cycle to generate the dual cooling and subcooling effect, separately. The DMR process and the proposed DSMR process are simulated (with same design parameters) using well-known commercial simulator Aspen Hysys v10. Then, both processes are optimized using modified coordinate descent algorithm. The specific energy consumption of DSMR is 0.284 kWh/kg-NG, which is equivalent to an energy saving of 22.89% when compared to the conventional DMR process. The exergy efficiency of DSMR is 36.62%, which is 29.67% higher than that of the classical DMR process. Furthermore, the economic feasibility of the proposed DSMR process is evaluated in terms of its total annualized cost, which is 18.52% lower than that of the DMR process. Thus, the proposed DSMR process offers remarkable energy and exergy efficiencies with minimal capital investment. Therefore, DSMR could replace the classical DMR process, as well as other complex mixed refrigerant-based liquefaction processes."

However, few studies have reported the HIV disclosure status of married men who have sex with men (MSM) and their female spouses. The purpose of this study was to describe the prevalence of HIV disclosure, and whether it was associated with spouses' HIV testing uptake and unprotected vaginal intercourse within marriage for MSM living with HIV (HIV + MSM) in China. A cross-sectional study was conducted in three Chinese cities. Of 309 participants, only 31.1% of men had disclosed their HIV status to spouses. About 80% of participants reported that their spouses had been tested for HIV. A small proportion of men (9.1%) had unprotected sex with their spouse after HIV diagnosis. Multivariate analyses indicated HIV disclosure was positively associated with HIV testing uptake of spouses, but there was no significant association between HIV disclosure and unprotected marital sexual behaviors for HIV + MSM. The findings indicated that HIV disclosure to spouses is uncommon among married HIV + MSM in China, and HIV disclosure is associated with increased uptake of HIV testing among spouses of MSM, but it does not decrease the unprotected sexual behaviors in marriage."
772,Does oil price really matter for the wage arrears in Russia?,"Su, Chi-Wei; Qin, Meng; Tao, Ran; Umar, Muhammad","This paper employs bootstrap full- and sub-sample rolling-window Granger causality tests to explore the time-varying interaction between oil price and wage arrears in Russia. The empirical results reveal that the decline in oil price leads wage arrears to increase, which indicates that there is an oil curse in Russia, as high wage arrears caused by low oil price may hinder the healthy development. Also, the rise in oil price causes wage arrears to decrease, and then the economic and social progress in Russia can be promoted. These results are supported by the Dutch-disease endogenous growth model, which highlights that oil price negatively affects wage arrears. In turn, there is a negative influence from wage arrears to oil price, which points out that the macroeconomic situation in Russia plays an important role in reflecting the changes of oil system. In the situation of international oil market uncertainty and the high dependence on the resources in Russia, investors can benefit from the above conclusions to diversify the investment risks. Also, it can provide implications for enterprises and governments to prevent potential wage arrears and improve the public confidence, as well as turn the resource curse into bonanza.

773,"Multi-objective optimization for an integrated renewable, power-to-gas and solid oxide fuel cell/gas turbine hybrid system in microgrid","Ding, Xiaoyi; Sun, Wei; Harrison, Gareth P.; Lv, Xiaojing; Weng, Yiwu","Power-to-gas (P2G) using excess renewable sources is an effective method to reduce renewable curtailment issues in microgrid system. The produced hydrogen is versatile green fuel for different energy sectors, such as electricity, heat and mobility. In recent researches, fuel cell-based system is considered as a promising technology to consume hydrogen (H2) generated from P2G due to high efficiency and cleanness. However, its economic and thermodynamic adaptability when coupled with intermittent renewable sources remains an open question to be addressed carefully. One of the major challenges in optimizing such system is to simultaneously capture the intraday and seasonal variation of renewable sources & load, as well as the internal thermodynamic process of critical components in appropriate modeling detail. This paper presents a multi-energy system for microgrid in which a wind-powered P2G is coupled with a detailed thermoeconomic model of solid oxide fuel cell/gas turbine (SOFC/GT) hybrid system. A two-level multi-objective optimization of planning and operation together is proposed. For system planning, the optimal balance between the least wind curtailment rate and total life cycle cost (LCC) is determined. To facilitate the coordinate operation of system components, a power management strategy is proposed in response to fluctuations of wind power and electricity load with considerations of multiple thermodynamic safety criteria. Results show that in the selected case, the multi-energy system operates with low wind curtailment rate of 0.63% and high renewable penetration level of 90.1%. The optimized LCC of multi-energy system is 2,468,093 with wind power accounting for 68.35% of total capital investment. With the power management strategy applied, the SOFC/GT could operate under the maximum electrical efficiency of 67.1% with safety constraints satisfied, making up only half investment cost of P2G. To capture seasonal variations, both winter and summer scenarios are detailly analyzed, sensitivity analysis is also carried out to evaluate the interaction between capacities of MES components.

774,Regional environmental efficiency in China: An empirical analysis based on entropy weight method and non-parametric models,"Li, Yongjun; Zhang, Qian; Wang, Lizheng; Liang, Liang","While vigorously developing its economy, China is attaching more and more importance to environmental protection and pollution control. In different regions of China, however, there are great differences in economic development and the degree of environmental pollution. In this study, we use the entropy weight method to calculate the pollution indexes of different regions from 2015 to 2017. Then we evaluate the Chinese regional environmental efficiency based on a new non-parametric frontier model. Moreover, a new set of ranking interval models that treat the undesirable outputs as inputs is proposed to further describe the regional disparities of the environmental efficiency between different regions with robustness. Finally, we conduct an empirical analysis by combining the stepwise regression and principal component analysis to identify the most influential variables that may affect regional environmental efficiency. According to the results, the southeast region of China performs best in environmental efficiency, followed by the northeast region, then the southwest region, and the worst is the northwest region. For managerial implications, we find that the investment of high education and the development of the IT industry can significantly increase regional environmental efficiency. More importantly, the results of the principal component analysis provide the government with a set of variables to strategically select the most appropriate strategy. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Parenting interventions may have the potential to improve outcomes for displaced families. To investigate this, we conducted a systematic review to identify the types of caregiver or parenting interventions that have been evaluated among displaced families, to assess their efficacy across a range of contexts, and to describe their cultural and contextual adaptations. The review followed PRISMA guidelines. At stage one, all articles describing caregiver/parenting interventions for forcibly displaced families were included to provide a scoping review of the state of the literature. At stage two, only randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-experimental designs were included, allowing for quantitative analysis of program effects. A total of 30 articles (24 studies) were identified in stage one. 95.8% of these articles were published in the past 10 years. Of these, 14 articles (10 studies) used an RCT or quasi-experimental design to assess program efficacy or effectiveness. Relative to control groups, those assigned to caregiving programs showed significant, beneficial effects across the domains of parenting behaviors and attitudes, child psychosocial and developmental outcomes, and parent mental health. Cultural adaptations and recruitment and engagement strategies are described. The evidence base for caregiving programs for displaced families has expanded in recent years but remains limited. Caregiving/parenting programs show promise for reducing the negative effects of forced displacement on families, but future studies are needed to understand which programs show the greatest potential for scalability."
776,S-Benzyl cysteine based cyclic dipeptide super hydrogelator: Enhancing efficacy of an anticancer drug via sustainable release,"Saswati Ghosh,Sayoni Nag,Krishna Das Saha,Biswadip Banerji,Saswati Ghosh,Sayoni Nag,Krishna Das Saha,Biswadip Banerji","Peptide-based low molecular weight supramolecular hydrogels hold promising aspects in various fields of application especially in biomaterial and biomedical sciences such as drug delivery, wound healing, tissue engineering, cell proliferation, and so on due to their extreme biocompatibility. Unlike linear peptides, cyclic peptides have more structural rigidity and tolerance to enzymatic degradation and high environmental stability which make them even better candidates for the above-said applications. Herein, a new small cyclic dipeptide (CDP) cyclo-(Leu-S-Bzl-Cys) (P1) consisting of L-leucine and S-benzyl protected L-cysteine was reported which formed a hydrogel at physiological conditions (at 37°C and pH = 7.46). The hydrogel formed from the cyclic dipeptide P1 showed very good tolerance towards environmental parameters such as pH and temperature and was seen to be stable for more than a year without any deformation. The hydrogel was thermoreversible and stable in the pH range 6-12. Mechanical strength of P1 hydrogel was measured by rheology experiments. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) and field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) images revealed that, in aqueous solvents, P1 self-assembled into a highly cross-linked nanofibrillar network which immobilized water molecules inside the cages and formed the hydrogel. The self-assembled cyclic dipeptide acquired the antiparallel β-sheet secondary structure, which was evident from CD and Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) studies. The β-sheet arrangement and formation of amyloid fibrils were further established by ThT binding assay. Furthermore, P1 was able to form a hydrogel in the presence of the anticancer drug 5-fluorouracil (5FU), and sustainable release of the drug from the hydrogel was measured in vitro. The hydrogelator P1 showed almost no cytotoxicity towards the human colorectal cancer cell line HCT116 up to a considerably high concentration and showed potential application in sustainable drug delivery. The co-assembly of 5FU and P1 hydrogel exhibited much better anticancer activity towards the HCT116 cancer cell line than 5FU alone and decreased the IC50 dose of 5FU to a much lower value."

For this study, a retrospective analysis of air quality modelling was performed to quantify the exposure to wildfire-PM2.5 across the Canadian population. The model included wildfire emissions from across North America for a 5-month period from May to September (i.e. wildfire season), between 2013 and 2015 and 2017-2018. Large variations in wildfire-PM2.5 were noted year-to-year, geospatially, and within fire season. The model results were then used to estimate the national population health impacts attributable to wildfire-PM2.5 and the associated economic valuation. The analysis estimated annual premature mortalities ranging from 54-240 premature mortalities attributable to short-term exposure and 570-2500 premature mortalities attributable to long-term exposure, as well as many non-fatal cardiorespiratory health outcomes. The economic valuation of the population health impacts was estimated per year at $410M-$1.8B for acute health impacts and $4.3B-$19B for chronic health impacts for the study period. The health impacts were greatest in the provinces with populations in close proximity to wildfire activity, though health impacts were also noted across many provinces indicating the long-range transport of wildfire-PM2.5. Understanding the population health impacts of wildfire smoke is important as climate change is anticipated to increase wildfire activity in Canada and abroad. (C) 2020 The Authors.

The aim of this study was to establish a shear-dependent platelet function defect in these patients. Patients were included based on high bleeding score and prior PFA prolongation. Common tests of von Willebrand factor (VWF) and platelet function and exome sequencing were performed. Microfluidic analysis of shear-dependent collagen-induced whole-blood thrombus formation was performed. In 14 PFA-only patients, compared to healthy volunteers, microfluidic tests showed significantly lower platelet adhesion and thrombus formation parameters. This was accompanied by lower integrin activation, phosphatidylserine exposure and P-selectin expression. Principal components analysis indicated VWF as primary explaining variable of PFA prolongation, whereas conventional platelet aggregation primarily explained the reduced thrombus parameters under shear. In five patients with severe microfluidic abnormalities, conventional platelet aggregation was in the lowest range of normal. No causal variants in Mendelian genes known to cause bleeding or platelet disorders were identified. Multiparameter assessment of whole-blood thrombus formation under shear indicates single or combined effects of low-normal VWF and low-normal platelet aggregation in these patients, suggesting a shear-dependent platelet function defect, not detected by static conventional haemostatic tests."
780,Becoming prosumer: Revealing trading preferences and decision-making strategies in peer-to-peer energy communities,"Hahnel, Ulf J. J.; Herberz, Mario; Pena-Bello, Alejandro; Parra, David; Brosch, Tobias","Increasing distributed renewable energy generation renders balancing of energy supply and demand more challenging. Peer-to-peer (P2P) exchange of decentrally generated energy is a promising means to optimize renewable energy flows. While previous research has primarily focused on the technological and economic benefits of P2P energy trading, little research has investigated customer preferences in this context so far. It is thus still unclear to what extent private actors such as homeowners are actually willing to participate in P2P energy communities and if so, under which conditions. Here, we address this research gap by analyzing homeowners' trading decisions in simulated P2P electricity trading scenarios. Findings based on a sample of 301 German homeowners show that community electricity prices and state of charge of private energy storages are key determinants of homeowners' trading behavior. We moreover identified four target groups that systematically differed in their decision-making strategies ranging from price-focused prosumers (38.9%) to classic nontrading consumers (22.6%). Our findings provide promising insights for the design of P2P communities and allow policy makers to more accurately predict risks and benefits associated with P2P projects. Finally, our findings contribute to the development of tailored policy instruments aiming to increase P2P trading in decentralized energy communities."
781,The heterogeneous effects of socioeconomic determinants on PM2.5 concentrations using a two-step panel quantile regression,"Yan, Dan; Ren, Xiaohang; Kong, Ying; Ye, Bin; Liao, Zangyi","The haze pollution caused by high PM2.5 concentrations has adverse health effects worldwide, especially in rapidly developing China. As meteorological conditions are uncontrollable, this study aims to investigate how anthropogenic factors affect the PM2.5 concentration under high, medium and low emission levels. The distribution of socioeconomic variables is often non-normal, with important information hidden in the tail. By using balanced panel data of 273 Chinese cities from 2010 to 2016, two-step panel quantile regression is adopted to examine the cross-quantile heterogeneity of seven socioeconomic variables: economic growth, industrial structure, urbanization, foreign direct investment (FDI), population density, public transportation and energy consumption. The empirical results show that the relationships of PM2.5 concentration with economic growth, urbanization, industrialization and FDI are heterogeneous. Compared with other variables, population density exerts the greatest positive effect on PM2.5 pollution across all quantile cities. Moreover, the impact of GDP per capita on PM2.5 concentration in the lower 25th quantile cities is stronger than those in the 25th-50th, 50th-75th and upper 75th quantile cities. The effects of FDI in the upper 75th and lower 25th quantile cities are higher than those in the 25th-50th and 50th-75th quantile cities, which supports the ""pollution haven"" hypothesis. The impact of industrial structure on PM2.5 concentration in the upper 75th quantile cities is larger than those in the 0-25th, 25th-50th, and 50th-75th quantile cities. The heterogeneous effects of these socioeconomic determinants could assist policymakers in implementing differentiated policies that fit cities with different levels of air pollution."

Therapeutic options for advanced HCC are limited. Systemic treatment, especially with conventional cytotoxic drugs, is usually ineffective. For more than a decade, sorafenib has been the only systemic drug that has been proven to be clinically effective for treating advanced HCC. However, over the past three years, the rapid progress of molecular targeted therapies has dramatically changed the treatment landscape for advanced HCC. Immune checkpoint therapies are now being incorporated into HCC therapies, and their combination with molecular targeted therapy is emerging as a tool to enhance the immune response. In this review, we summarize the development and progress of molecular targeted agents and immunotherapies in HCC."

784,Utilization of coal fly ash in China: a mini-review on challenges and future directions,"Luo, Yang; Wu, Yinghong; Ma, Shuhua; Zheng, Shili; Zhang, Yi; Chu, Paul K.","The rapid economic development in China places a large demand for energy, and as a result, thermal power plants in China are producing an enormous amount of coal fly ash (CFA) which causes severe environmental pollution. This paper briefly describes the current production and utilization status of CFA in China and identifies the challenges confronting sustainable CFA utilization as the Chinese economy is being transformed. These issues include a regional imbalance in supply and demand, reducing demand in the real estate industry as well as stricter laws for environmental protection. Viable directions for future CFA utilization are proposed, for example, production of CFA-based ceramic tiles, recovery of elemental resources, agricultural melioration, treatment of wastewater and flue gas, and production of high-volume CFA concretes. This paper has some guiding significance for sustainable and cleaner utilization of CFA in China and even worldwide."
785,fMRI replicability during emotional scene viewing: Functional regions and sample size,"Nicola Sambuco,Nicola Sambuco","Recent findings have questioned the replicability of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in the study of affective processing, reporting low replicability of emotional enhancement during a face-matching task. However, poor replicability may instead reflect a lack of emotional engagement for face matching. In the current study, replicability of emotional enhancement was tested in a large (N = 160) sample when emotional engagement was assessed during pleasant, neutral, and unpleasant picture viewing, which reliably engages affective reactions in both the brain and the body. Replicability was computed using a subsampling technique, in which random sets of subjects of different sample sizes (N = 20, 40, 60, 80) were selected from the entire dataset, and replicability of emotional enhancement for peaks, clusters, and voxels were averaged across 500 permutations for each sample size. Consistent with previous findings, fMRI replicability increased with increasing sample size. On the other hand, even with relatively small samples, fMRI replicability for peaks, clusters, and voxels during emotional, compared to neutral, scene viewing was good to excellent. Importantly, replicability varied in different brain regions, with excellent replicability at both the cluster and peak level with an N of 40, at the most conservative threshold (p < .001), in the amygdala and the visual cortex. The data argue against general recommendations regarding sample size in fMRI studies of emotion, suggesting instead that degree of replicability depends on successful emotional engagement in task-related brain regions."
786,Techno-economic analysis of low-carbon hydrogen production by sorption enhanced steam methane reforming (SE-SMR) processes,"Yan, Yongliang; Manovic, Vasilije; Anthony, Edward J.; Clough, Peter T.","Hydrogen is an attractive energy carrier that will play a key role in future global energy transitions. This work investigates the techno-economic performance of six different sorption enhanced steam methane reforming (SESMR) configurations integrated with an indirect natural gas or biomass-fired calciner, oxy-fuel combustion and chemical-looping combustion for large-scale blue and carbon-negative hydrogen production. The technoeconomic performance of the proposed cases was evaluated by their net efficiency, CO2 capture efficiency, levelised cost of hydrogen (LCOH), and costs of CO2 avoided and removal. A sensitivity analysis was also conducted to evaluate the key parameters and explore existing uncertainties that can affect the economic performance of the proposed SE-SMR processes. The results revealed that the proposed systems were comparable with conventional steam methane reforming (SMR) with carbon capture and storage (CCS). The LCOH of the proposed SE-SMR plants ranged from 1.90-2.80 pound/kg, and the costs of CO2 avoided and removal ranged from 33-69 pound/tonne and 58-10(7) pound/tonne, respectively. By applying a carbon price (16 pound/tonne CO2), the costs of CO2 avoided and removal for the proposed SE-SMR processes could be significantly reduced. The results of cumulative discounted cash flow of SE-SMR plants at a hydrogen selling price of 3.00 pound/kg indicated that all the investment of the proposed cases could be paid back after eight years, even if the carbon tax is zero."
787,Economic costs of heat-induced reductions in worker productivity due to global warming,"Orlov, Anton; Sillmann, Jana; Aunan, Kristin; Kjellstrom, Tord; Aaheim, Asbjorn","We assess economic costs of heat-induced reductions in worker productivity at global scale under RCP2.6 and RCP8.5. Losses in worker productivity are calculated by using an empirically estimated epidemiological exposure-response function, and the associated economic costs are assessed by using a dynamic mull-region, multi-sector computable general equilibrium model. Autonomous mechanisation of outdoor work in agriculture and construction is implemented in the model. We find that under RCP8.5 by 2100, heat-induced reductions in worker productivity result in an average decline of 1.4% in global gross domestic product (GDP) relative to the reference scenario with no climate change. This is approximately 0.4 percentage points less than when no autonomous mechanisation is assumed. For comparison, measuring the economic costs using occupational health and safety recommendations leads to a 2.4% reduction in global GDP, which is substantially larger than when the epidemiological exposure-response function is used. Countries of Africa, South-East Asia, and South Asia are the worst affected by heat stress. However, economic costs could be substantially alleviated if a 2 degrees C global warming target is achieved. Under RCP2.6, the average reduction in global GDP is only 0.5%. A large fraction of global mitigation costs of achieving the 2 degrees C global warming target could be offset by the avoided adverse impacts of heat stress on worker productivity at higher warming levels."
788,When there is only one patient: Induction of labour for termination of pregnancy,"Dustin Costescu,Carween Mui,Dustin Costescu,Carween Mui","Induction of labour when no live birth is anticipated presents a number of unique considerations for members of the healthcare team. The main indication for Induction of Labour for Termination of Pregnancy (iTOP) is intrauterine fetal death (IUFD) beyond a gestational age where surgical management is available, but may also be indicated in the setting of induction abortion (with or without feticide), and termination of pregnancy (with or without infant palliation) for pregnancies where a lethal fetal anomaly is diagnosed. In tertiary care centres, iTOP may represent a significant proportion of labouring patients. Despite this, there are few guidelines dedicated specifically to iTOP in either obstetrical or family planning specialties. In this article, we will consider four main themes from an evidence-informed perspective: method selection; pre-induction preparation; clinical considerations during and after iTOP; and complications management."
789,Influence of nano and bulk copper on agile frog development,"Olga Jovanović Glavaš,Nikolina Stjepanović,Branimir K Hackenberger,Olga Jovanović Glavaš,Nikolina Stjepanović,Branimir K Hackenberger","Nanotechnology, as one of the fastest-growing industries, offers many benefits in various fields. However, properties that contribute to its positive effects, in other context, can cause adverse effects to various organisms, such as amphibians. Identifying possible negative effects on its survival is crucial since amphibians are the most threatened group of vertebrates. In that context, we investigated the influence of both nano and bulk copper on embryonic development of agile frog, Rana dalmatina. The embryos were exposed to various concentrations (0.01 mg/L, 0.075 mg/L, 0.15 mg/L or 0.3 mg/L) of either nano (CuO, declared size 40-80 nm) or bulk form (CuSO4·5H2O) for 16 days. Upon the experiment, tadpoles were measured and weighted, then homogenized and their protein, lipid, and carbohydrates content determined, as well as the activity of LDH. Our results suggest stronger negative influence of nano copper to size and weight of tadpoles, and bulk copper on lipid content, while both had strong negative effect on carbohydrates content, and LDH activity. In addition, our results suggest agile frog to be more susceptible to negative influence of both, nano and bulk copper, than commonly used Xenopus laevis."
790,Influence of FDI quality on energy efficiency in China based on seemingly unrelated regression method,"Pan, Xiongfeng; Guo, Shucen; Han, Cuicui; Wang, Mengyang; Song, Jinbo; Liao, Xianchun","How to use foreign direct investment (FDI) to achieve sustainable development of resources, environment and economy in China has become an increasingly important proposition. Previous studies mainly focused on the relationship between FDI quantity and energy efficiency, and neglected the important role of FDI quality in improving energy efficiency. Based on the panel data on 30 provinces in China from 2003 to 2016, this paper uses slacks-based measure data envelopment analysis (SBM-DEA) method to estimate energy efficiency, and then uses seemingly unrelated regression (SUR) method to empirically study the influence of FDI quality on energy efficiency. The results are presented as follows: (1) From the national level view, FDI quality plays a significant role in promoting China's energy efficiency; (2) From the regional-level view, FDI quality plays a significant role in promoting China's energy efficiency in coastal and inland areas, but its role in the inland area is significantly greater than that in the coastal area. The results indicate that China should make full use of the opportunity of global economic integration and pay more attention to the improvement of FDI quality, so as to promote energy efficiency and low-carbon economic development.

791,Spatial pattern and driving factors for interprovincial natural gas consumption in China: Based on SNA and LMDI,"Bu, Yan; Wang, Erda; Bai, Jinhong; Shi, Qingbin","In China's energy transformation strategy, natural gas is the ""bridge fuel"" to cleaner production. This paper innovatively uses the classic method in sociology, social network analysis (SNA), and reveals the network characteristics and spatial pattern of interprovincial natural gas consumption in China. Zhejiang is the center of China's interprovincial natural gas consumption network, and the network can be clustered into four blocks: net spillover block, net beneficial block, brokers block, bidirectional spillover block. In addition, LMDI (logarithmic mean Divisia index) quantified the driving factors of China's natural gas consumption in each province. Overall, economic effect and fossil energy structure effect are the major driving factors of natural gas consumption, the energy intensity effect is one of the major restraining factors of natural gas consumption. Matching the driving factors of each province with the block model, and in more detail, economic effect is the major driving factor of natural gas consumption in the net spillover block, followed by spatial expansion effect. In the bidirectional spillover block, the fossil energy structural effect is the major driving factor of the natural gas consumption. Accordingly, we put forward the general measures and specific measures to protect the natural gas consumption. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."
792,Novel Machine Learning Approaches for Modelling the Gully Erosion Susceptibility,"Arabameri, Alireza; Nalivan, Omid Asadi; Pal, Subodh Chandra; Chakrabortty, Rabin; Saha, Asish; Lee, Saro; Pradhan, Biswajeet; Dieu Tien Bui","The extreme form of land degradation caused by the formation of gullies is a major challenge for the sustainability of land resources. This problem is more vulnerable in the arid and semi-arid environment and associated damage to agriculture and allied economic activities. Appropriate modeling of such erosion is therefore needed with optimum accuracy for estimating vulnerable regions and taking appropriate initiatives. The Golestan Dam has faced an acute problem of gully erosion over the last decade and has adversely affected society. Here, the artificial neural network (ANN), general linear model (GLM), maximum entropy (MaxEnt), and support vector machine (SVM) machine learning algorithm with 90/10, 80/20, 70/30, 60/40, and 50/50 random partitioning of training and validation samples was selected purposively for estimating the gully erosion susceptibility. The main objective of this work was to predict the susceptible zone with the maximum possible accuracy. For this purpose, random partitioning approaches were implemented. For this purpose, 20 gully erosion conditioning factors were considered for predicting the susceptible areas by considering the multi-collinearity test. The variance inflation factor (VIF) and tolerance (TOL) limit were considered for multi-collinearity assessment for reducing the error of the models and increase the efficiency of the outcome. The ANN with 50/50 random partitioning of the sample is the most optimal model in this analysis. The area under curve (AUC) values of receiver operating characteristics (ROC) in ANN (50/50) for the training and validation data are 0.918 and 0.868, respectively. The importance of the causative factors was estimated with the help of the Jackknife test, which reveals that the most important factor is the topography position index (TPI). Apart from this, the prioritization of all predicted models was estimated taking into account the training and validation data set, which should help future researchers to select models from this perspective. This type of outcome should help planners and local stakeholders to implement appropriate land and water conservation measures."
793,Scientists' warning to humanity on the freshwater biodiversity crisis,"Albert, James S.; Destouni, Georgia; Duke-Sylvester, Scott M.; Magurran, Anne E.; Oberdorff, Thierry; Reis, Roberto E.; Winemiller, Kirk O.; Ripple, William J.","Freshwater ecosystems provide irreplaceable services for both nature and society. The quality and quantity of freshwater affect biogeochemical processes and ecological dynamics that determine biodiversity, ecosystem productivity, and human health and welfare at local, regional and global scales. Freshwater ecosystems and their associated riparian habitats are amongst the most biologically diverse on Earth, and have inestimable economic, health, cultural, scientific and educational values. Yet human impacts to lakes, rivers, streams, wetlands and groundwater are dramatically reducing biodiversity and robbing critical natural resources and services from current and future generations. Freshwater biodiversity is declining rapidly on every continent and in every major river basin on Earth, and this degradation is occurring more rapidly than in terrestrial ecosystems. Currently, about one third of all global freshwater discharges pass through human agricultural, industrial or urban infrastructure. About one fifth of the Earth's arable land is now already equipped for irrigation, including all the most productive lands, and this proportion is projected to surpass one third by midcentury to feed the rapidly expanding populations of humans and commensal species, especially poultry and ruminant livestock. Less than one fifth of the world's preindustrial freshwater wetlands remain, and this proportion is projected to decline to under one tenth by midcentury, with imminent threats from water transfer megaprojects in Brazil and India, and coastal wetland drainage megaprojects in China. The Living Planet Index for freshwater vertebrate populations has declined to just one third that of 1970, and is projected to sink below one fifth by midcentury. A linear model of global economic expansion yields the chilling prediction that human utilization of critical freshwater resources will approach one half of the Earth's total capacity by midcentury. Although the magnitude and growth of the human freshwater footprint are greater than is generally understood by policy makers, the news media, or the general public, slowing and reversing dramatic losses of freshwater species and ecosystems is still possible. We recommend a set of urgent policy actions that promote clean water, conserve watershed services, and restore freshwater ecosystems and their vital services. Effective management of freshwater resources and ecosystems must be ranked amongst humanity's highest priorities."
794,Upper Cervical Compression Myelopathy Caused by the Retro-Odontoid Pseudotumor With Degenerative Osteoarthritis and Calcium Pyrophosphate Dihydrate Disease: A Case Report and Literature Review,"Takashi Yurube,Tetsuhiro Iguchi,Keisuke Kinoshita,Takashi Sadamitsu,Kenichiro Kakutani,Takashi Yurube,Tetsuhiro Iguchi,Keisuke Kinoshita,Takashi Sadamitsu,Kenichiro Kakutani","The retro-odontoid pseudotumor is often concurrent with atlantoaxial subluxation (AAS). Therefore, the pseudotumor is relatively common in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) but rare in primary osteoarthritis (OA). This is a case report of an elderly male patient suffering from neck pain and compression myelopathy caused by the craniocervical pseudotumor with OA but without atlantoaxial instability. He had long-lasting peripheral and spinal pain treated by nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Imaging found upper cervical spondylosis without AAS or dynamic instability but with periodontoid calcifications and ossifications, suggesting calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate (CPPD) crystal deposition. Based on a comprehensive literature search and review, CPPD disease around the atlantodental joint is a possible contributor to secondary OA development and retro-odontoid pannus formation through chronic inflammation, which can be enough severe to induce compression myelopathy in non-RA patients without AAS. The global increase in the aged population advises caution regarding more prevalent upper cervical spine disorders associated with OA and CPPD."
795,Medium-Chain fatty acids and long-chain alcohols production from waste activated sludge via two-stage anaerobic fermentation,"Wu, Shu-Lin; Wei, Wei; Sun, Jing; Xu, Qiuxiang; Dai, Xiaohu; Ni, Bing-Jie","Traditional bioenergy recovery in the form of short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) from waste activated sludge (WAS) is generally limited by economic unattractiveness and complexity of products separation. Herein, a novel biotechnology process of two-stage anaerobic fermentation for converting the WAS into high energy density, easy-separated medium chain fatty acids (MCFAs) and long-chain alcohols (LCAs) was evaluated. In this process, the WAS was first converted to WAS alkaline fermentation liquid (WASAFL), serving as electron acceptors (EAs) and inoculum, then adding ethanol as electron donor (ED) for chain elongation (CE). The co-production of MCFAs and LCAs during CE were studied under three different ED to EA ra-tios, i.e., 3:1, 4:1 and 5:1. Experimental results demonstrated that when the ratio of ED to EA increased from 3:1 to 5:1, the production of MCFA and LCAs respectively increased from 5.57 0.17 and 2.58 +/- 0.18 to7.67 +/- 0.48 and 4.21 +/- 0.19 g COD/L. A similar observation was made in the total product electron efficiency, increasing from 59.9% to 72.1%. However, the highest total product selectivity (i.e., 68.0%) and highest products production yield (i.e., 59.77%) were not achieved at the ED to EA ratio of 5:1 due to toxicity caused by higher accumulation of n-caproate. The kinetic analysis further confirmed that high ratio of ED to EA induced improvement in product maximum yield, production rate for both MCFAs and LCAs. Microbial community analysis indicated that Clostridium, Caproiciproducens, Acinetobacter, Exilispira, and Oscillibacter were clearly enriched in the CE reactor and had positive correlation with MCFAs and LCAs production.

796,Nexus between green finance and climate change mitigation in N-11 and BRICS countries: empirical estimation through difference in differences (DID) approach,"Nawaz, Muhammad Atif; Seshadri, Usha; Kumar, Pranav; Aqdas, Ramaisa; Patwary, Ataul Karim; Riaz, Madiha","Green finance is inextricably linked to investment risk, particularly in emerging and developing economies (EMDE). This study uses the difference in differences (DID) method to evaluate the mean causal effects of a treatment on an outcome of the determinants of scaling up green financing and climate change mitigation in the N-11 countries from 2005 to 2019. After analyzing with a dummy for the treated countries, it was confirmed that the outcome covariates: rescon (renewable energy sources consumption), population, FDI, CO2, inflation, technical corporation grants, domestic credit to the private sector, and research and development are very significant in promoting green financing and climate change mitigation in the study countries. The probit regression results give a different outcome, as rescon, FID, CO2, Human Development Index (HDI), and investment in the energy sector by the private sector that will likely have an impact on the green financing and climate change mitigation of the study countries. Furthermore, after matching the analysis through the nearest neighbor matching, kernel matching, and radius matching, it produced mixed results for both the treated and the untreated countries. Either group experienced an improvement in green financing and climate change mitigation or a decrease. Overall, the DID showed no significant difference among the countries."

The 3' untranslated region of key factors associated with breast cancer metastasis were examined for candidate miRNA binding site using Targetscan. The predicted binding was validated. The specific effects of single miRNA and dynamic effects of the miRNA-mRNA axis on breast cancer cell metastasis were investigated. miR-556-5p was downregulated in breast cancer samples according to online datasets and experimental analyses. In breast cancer cells, miR-556-5p overexpression inhibited, whereas miR-556-5p inhibition promoted cancer cell invasion and migration. Among key factors associated with breast cancer bone metastasis, parathyroid hormone related protein (PTHrP) 3'UTR possessed miR-556-5p binding site. Through direct binding, miR-556-5p negatively regulated PTHrP expression. In breast cancer cell lines, miR-556-5p inhibition promoted, whereas PTHrP silencing suppressed cancer cell migration, invasion, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition; the effects of miR-556-5p inhibition were partially reversed by PTHrP silencing. In summary, miR-556-5p targets PTHrP to modulate the cell migration and invasion of breast cancer."

Load distribution causes kyphosis by the time. Treatment of posttraumatic kyphosis is still controversial. We reviewed the literature between 2010 and 2020 using a search with keywords ""thoracolumbar fracture and kyphosis."" We removed osteoporotic fractures, ankylosing spondylitis fractures, non-English language papers, case reports, and low-quality case series. Up-to-date information on posttraumatic kyphosis management was reviewed to reach an agreement in a consensus meeting of the World Federation of Neurosurgical Societies (WFNS) Spine Committee. The first meeting was conducted in Peshawar in December 2019 with WFNS Spine Committee members' presence and participation. The second meeting was a virtual meeting via the internet on June 12, 2020. We utilized the Delphi method to administer the questionnaire to preserve a high degree of validity. We summarized 42 papers on posttraumatic kyphosis. Surgical treatment of thoracolumbar kyphosis due to unstable burst fractures can be done via a posterior only approach. Less blood loss and reduced surgery time are the main advantages of posterior surgery. Kyphosis angle for surgical decision and fusion levels are controversial. However, global sagittal balance should be taken into consideration for the segment that has to be included. Adding an intermediate screw at the fractured level strengthens the construct."

The positive ESG disclosure-EES sustainability performance relationship found in this study provides evidence that disclosing the implementation of environment and social strategies within an effective system of corporate governance in the organization strengthens corporate sustainability performance. The results also show that environmental performance and social performance are significantly positively related to economic sustainable performance, indicating that the corporation's economic value and creating value for society are interdependent. In line with the stakeholder theory and the shared value theory, ESG information disclosure to all stakeholders is an important factor in creating a competitive advantage for enhancing corporate sustainability performance."
800,Long non-coding RNA CCL2 promoted gastric cancer function via miR-128/ PARP2 signal pathway,"Liang Ma,Yunshan Jiang,Ning Wu,Liang Ma,Yunshan Jiang,Ning Wu","Amounts of studies have revealed long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) was related to the development of gastric cancer. Here, our results suggested the function and regulatory mechanism of CCL2 in gastric cancer. Quantitative polymerase-chain reaction (qPCR) was employed to inspect lncRNA CCL2 and miR-128 expression in normal gastric cell line (GES-1) and tumor cell lines (HGC-27 and MKN-45). The effects of CCL2 and miR-128 were measured via Luciferase reporter test. Western blot was used to check PARP2 protein expression. CCL2 expression and PARP2 protein levels were up-regulated, while miR-128 expression was obviously lower. Meanwhile, CCL2 down-regulating significantly repressed the proliferation, migration, and invasion by regulating miR-128. In addition, we proved miR-128 was a direct target of CCL2 through double luciferase assay and bioinformatics analysis. Moreover, miR-128 markedly inhibited the proliferation, migration, and invasion in gastric cancer. More importantly, miR-128 could reverse the effects of lncRNA CCL2 knocked down. PARP2-si obviously suppressed in gastric cancer proliferation, migration, and invasion. Meanwhile, miR-128 mimic and the knockout of CCL2 distinctly decreased PARP2 protein level. Additionally, luciferase report experiments certificated that PARP2 targeted miR-128, implying PARP2 directly interacted with miR-128 in gastric cancer. More interestingly, the downregulation of PARP could reverse the trend triggered by miR-128 inhibitor in gastric tumor. All over these results showed lncRNA CCL2 played importance of role in gastric tumor via miR-128/PARP2 axis signal pathway. LncRNA CCL2 accelerated gastric cancer progression by regulating miR-128/PARP2 signaling pathway, providing a novel possible strategy for the treatment of gastric cancer."
801,Does Economic Policy Uncertainty Affect CO2 Emissions? Empirical Evidence from the United States,"Wang, Qing; Xiao, Kefeng; Lu, Zhou","This paper aims to examine the effects of economic policy uncertainty (measured by the World Uncertainty Index-WUI) on the level of CO2 emissions in the United States for the period from 1960 to 2016. For this purpose, we consider the unit root test with structural breaks and the autoregressive-distributed lag (ARDL) model. We find that the per capita income promotes CO2 emissions in the long run. Similarly, the WUI measures are positively associated with CO2 emissions in the long run. Energy prices negatively affect CO2 emissions both in the short run and the long run. Possible implications of climate change are also discussed."

In this regard, the effect of parenting styles, attachment styles, and the mediating variable of addiction was investigated on child abuse (CA). Multi-stage random sampling and sample size were selected based on the sample size estimation software (510 people) and according to the 20% probability of a drop in the number of subjects, 530 people (265 boys and 265 girls) and 1060 parents were selected. The available method was selected from a sample of 530 people who were selected based on the Addiction Severity Index (ASI) and answered Baumrind's Parenting Styles Questionnaire (PSQ), Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ), and Adult Attachment Scale (AAS). Data were assessed by analysis of variance, mediator analysis, and path analysis. The results showed that differences in parenting styles cause differences in their attachment styles. The results supported only the relationship between the two components of parental affection and control with the attachment avoidance index, and no relationship was observed between these components and the anxiety index. Perceived emotional abuse, mediates the relationship between parental parenting components and the child attachment avoidance index. Finally, it was achieved to a model that shows how the two factors of affection and control simultaneously affect the avoidance index, mediated by parental addiction."
803,Rethinking Social Relationships in Adulthood: The Differential Investment of Resources Model,"Oliver Huxhold,Katherine L Fiori,Tim Windsor,Oliver Huxhold,Katherine L Fiori,Tim Windsor","Empirical evidence about the development of social relationships across adulthood into late life continues to accumulate, but theoretical development has lagged behind. The Differential Investment of Resources (DIRe) model integrates these empirical advances. The model defines the investment of time and energy into social ties varying in terms of emotional closeness and kinship as the core mechanism explaining the formation and maintenance of social networks. Individual characteristics, acting as capacities, motivations, and skills, determine the amount, direction, and efficacy of the investment. The context (e.g., the living situation) affects the social opportunity structure, the amount of time and energy available, and individual characteristics. Finally, the model describes two feedback loops: (a) social capital affecting the individual's living situation and (b) different types of ties impacting individual characteristics via social exchanges, social influences, and social evaluations. The proposed model will provide a theoretical basis for future research and hypothesis testing."

We also provide current research challenges and future directions regarding medical GDM. It is hoped that our study will be helpful for researchers in the field of GDM in Healthcare Industry 4.0."
805,Optimal operation of water-energy microgrids; a mixed integer linear programming formulation,"Moazeni, Faegheh; Khazaei, Javad","Increasing energy efficiency in water distribution systems is one of the most important aspects of a sustainable water infrastructure. Additionally, providing this energy from renewable sources is an essential step towards a cleaner production in energy infrastructures. Therefore in this paper, an optimization model is developed to minimize the energy consumption of a water-energy microgrid system. A day-ahead economic dispatch model is developed to minimize the daily cost of energy in the waterenergy microgrid. The energy consumption of water system is minimized using tank's and pump's scheduling and operation, hydraulic factors, and daily demand. Particularly, the electricity consumption of the pump is minimized by adjusting its head gain and flow rate via a variable speed. The energy unit is composed of an aggregated conventional power generation, solar photovoltaic, wind generation, and battery energy storage system. To offer a global optimum for the proposed non-linear programming formulation, bivariate piecewise linear approximation is used to linearize the pump's power consumption and gain, and conservation of energy-mass. In addition, univariate piecewise linear approximation is used to linearize the energy consumption function of conventional power generation systems. The optimization results of the mixed integer linear programming and mixed integer non-linear programming formulations for the studied water-energy microgrid system are compared and discussed. These models are developed to concurrently minimize the electricity consumption of a micro water-energy distribution network in two scenarios of (1) standalone water distribution system operation and (2) an integrated islanded micro water-energy system with electrical loads.

806,Analysis of the spatial association network structure of China's transportation carbon emissions and its driving factors,"Bai, Caiquan; Zhou, Lei; Xia, Minle; Feng, Chen","Using the social network analysis method, this paper explores the characteristics of the spatial association network structure of China's provincial transportation carbon emissions from 2005 to 2015 and its driving factors. The results are as follows: (1) The spatial association of China's provincial transportation carbon emissions exhibits an intuitive network structure. The degree of closeness which were 0.2253 and 0.2333 in 2005 and 2015 respectively shows an increasing trend on the whole. However, it hit the bottom in 2011, reaching a minimum of 0.2230, which is the ""low closeness degree inflection point"". (2) The spatial association network presents a significant ""core-edge"" distribution pattern. Specifically, in the central and eastern regions of China, Henan and Jiangsu have degrees of up to 58.621 and 44.828, which are at the network center. However, some remote regions, like Jilin and Hainan, have degrees of less than 20.000, which are marginalized. (3) The geographical adjacency, the expansion of the difference in R&D investment, and the narrowing of the difference in economic development promote the formation of the interprovincial spatial association. Therefore, in the process of controlling carbon emissions from transportation, the government should focus on the provinces at the network center and pay attention to the impact of the R&D investment on the spatial association of transportation carbon emissions."

In this work, a library of L-shaped spermine-based cationic lipids with identical and nonidentical hydrophobic chains having variable carbon lengths (from C10 to C18) was designed and synthesized. These lipids were characterized and the structure-activity relationships of these compounds were determined for DNA binding and transfection ability when formulated as cationic liposomes. The liposomes were then used successfully for the transfection of HEK293T, HeLa, PC3, H460, HepG2, SH-SY5Y and Calu'3 cell lines. The transfection efficiency of lipids with nonidentical hydrocarbon chains was greater than the identical analogue. These reagents exhibited superior efficiency to the commercial reagent, Lipofectamine3000, under both serum-free and 10-40 % serum conditions in HEK293T, HeLa and H460 cell lines. The lipids were not toxic to the tested cell line. The results suggest that L-shaped spermine-based cationic lipids with nonidentical hydrocarbon tails could serve as efficient and safe nonviral vector gene carriers in further in vivo studies."
808,Life-Cycle Assessment and Monetary Measurements for the Carbon Footprint Reduction of Public Buildings,"Trovato, Maria Rosa; Nocera, Francesco; Giuffrida, Salvatore","Energy consumption in public buildings increased drastically over the last decade. Significant policy actions towards the promotion of energy efficiency in the building sector have been developed involving sustainable low-CO2-emission technologies. This paper presents the results of an economic-environmental valuation of a standard energy retrofit project for a public building in a Mediterranean area, integrating a life-cycle assessment (LCA) into the traditional economic-financial evaluation pattern. The study results show that simple retrofit of sustainable low-CO2-emission strategies such as wooden double-glazed windows, organic external wall insulation systems, and green roofs can reduce energy needs for heating and cooling by 58.5% and 33.4%, respectively. Furthermore, the implementation of an LCA highlights that the use of sustainable materials reduces the building's carbon footprint index by 54.1% after retrofit compared to standard materials, thus providing an additional increase in the socio-environmental-economic-financial results of 18%. Some proposals are made about the accounting of the replacement costs and the residual value as requested in the logic of life-cycle cost (that is the economic extension of the LCA), namely concerning the method to take into account the replacement costs and the residual value. The economic calculation highlights the fundamental role played by tax benefits supporting the building energy retrofit, also in temperate climate zones, thus allowing the creation of environmental benefits in addition to remarkable cost savings."
809,The Associations between Family-Related Factors and Excessive Internet Use in Adolescents,"Faltynkova, Anna; Blinka, Lukas; Sevcikova, Anna; Husarova, Daniela","This study examined the relationship between Excessive Internet Use (EIU) in adolescents and their family environment, namely the family type, the family economic status, the effect of parental care, the level of parental control, the amount of parental monitoring, the quality of communication, and the time spent together. The study was based on data from an international survey, Health Behaviour in School Aged Children (HBSC), conducted in Slovakia. The sample representative for adolescents included 2547 participants (51% boys) aged 13-15. Multiple-step linear regression revealed that higher parental care and parental monitoring predicted lower EIU, while higher parental overprotection and lower socioeconomic status predicted higher EIU. The results suggest that both so-called optimal parenting (i.e., the balance of emotional warmth and protection) and the adolescent ' s autonomy lower the risk of EIU. Family factors explained about 14% of the variance, which suggests that aside from personal, cognitive and affective factors, a close social environment also plays an important role in adolescence EIU."

Gender-based inequities remain an obstacle to quality of care, including within the now majority women subspecialty of gynecologic oncology. The results of the 2020 SGO State of the Society Survey prompted this evidence-based review. Evidence related to relevant aspects of the clinical care model by which women with malignancies are cared for is summarized. Recommendations are made that include ways to create work environments where all members of a gynecologic oncology clinical care team, regardless of gender, can thrive. These recommendations aim to improve equality and equity within the specialty and, in doing so, elevate the care that our patients receive."

Food policy, dietary guidelines and food security strategies need to evolve from the limited historical approach, mainly focused on nutrients and health, to a new one considering the environmental, socio-economic and cultural impact-and thus the sustainability-of diets. Objective: To present an updated version of the Mediterranean Diet Pyramid (MDP) to reflect multiple environmental concerns. Methods: We performed a revision and restructuring of the MDP to incorporate more recent findings on the sustainability and environmental impact of the Mediterranean Diet pattern, as well as its associations with nutrition and health. For each level of the MDP we provided a third dimension featuring the corresponding environmental aspects related to it. Conclusions: The new environmental dimension of the MDP enhances food intake recommendations addressing both health and environmental issues. Compared to the previous 2011 version, it emphasizes more strongly a lower consumption of red meat and bovine dairy products, and a higher consumption of legumes and locally grown eco-friendly plant foods as much as possible."

Labs were notable for moderate peripheral eosinophilia, and computed tomography (CT) scan demonstrated extensive crazy-paving throughout bilateral upper lung fields. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) revealed macrophages with lipid-filled vacuoles and negative periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) stain. Further history obtained from the patient and family was notable for daily application of commercially available vapor rub to nares and intentional deep inhalation of nebulized fluids containing scented oils. The patient was diagnosed with exogenous lipoid pneumonia through an unusual route of lipid administration."
813,Catatonic Episodes Related to Substance Use: A Cross-Sectional Study Using Electronic Healthcare Records,"Su Ying Yeoh,Emmert Roberts,Fraser Scott,Timothy R Nicholson,Anthony S David,Jonathan P Rogers,Su Ying Yeoh,Emmert Roberts,Fraser Scott,Timothy R Nicholson,Anthony S David,Jonathan P Rogers","Objective: Substance use has increasingly been linked to the onset of catatonic episodes; however, no large observational studies have examined this association. This study aimed to identify catatonic episodes temporally associated with acute intoxication, withdrawal or chronic substance use, investigate which substances were involved, and compare clinical characteristics of substance-related and non-substance-related catatonic episodes. Methods: This study retrospectively identified all catatonic episodes recorded in an electronic case register hosted at a large secondary mental health trust in London, UK. Episodes were categorized as substance-related if the clinical record reported either a positive urine drug screen, an ICD-10 diagnosis of a mental or behavioral disorder due to substance use, or documented substance use between two weeks prior to the catatonic episode and the date of the catatonic episode. Results: 108 of 2130 catatonic episodes (5.1%) were deemed substance-related. The number of contemporaneously reported substance-related episodes increased between 2007 and 2016 [r = 0.72, p = 0.02]. Episodes in the context of acute intoxication (n = 54) were most frequently related to cannabis (n = 31) or cocaine (n = 5) use, whilst those in the context of drug withdrawal (n = 8) were most commonly related to alcohol, opioids and benzodiazepines. There were 50 episodes of catatonia associated with chronic substance use without intoxication or withdrawal, of which the majority were related to cannabis use (n = 37). 21 episodes had overlapping intoxication, withdrawal and chronic use of different substances within an episode. Compared to catatonic episodes not related to substance use, episodes of substance-related catatonia occurred in individuals who were younger (mean age 31.3 years [SD 12.2] vs 35.7 years [SD 16.3], p = 0.01) and more likely to be men (74.0% vs 54.3%, p < 0.001). The clinical features of catatonia were similar between the two groups. Conclusions: A relatively small proportion of catatonic episodes were temporally associated with reported substance use within their electronic records. Substance-related catatonic episodes were mostly related to cannabis use, but other substances including cocaine, alcohol, opioids and benzodiazepines were sometimes implicated. This is likely an underestimate of substance-related catatonia use due to issues with documentation and appropriate investigation."
814,"Financial development, globalization and ecological footprint in G7: further evidence from threshold cointegration and fractional frequency causality tests","Pata, Ugur Korkut; Yilanci, Veli","This paper empirically explores the dynamic relationships between financial development, globalization, energy consumption, economic growth, and ecological footprint in G7 countries over the period 1980-2015. Using a recently introduced threshold cointegration test with an endogenous structural break, the paper aims primarily to determine the effects of financial development and globalization on environmental degradation. The results confirm the presence of cointegration in Canada, Italy, and Japan. The long-run estimates indicate that globalization significantly reduces ecological footprint in Canada and Italy, while financial development reduces pollution in Japan. The findings also demonstrate that energy consumption stimulates environmental degradation in these three countries. Furthermore, the causality test that considers smooth structural breaks via a fractional frequency flexible Fourier function indicates that globalization causes ecological footprint in all the G7 countries except France, while financial development causes ecological footprint in France, Japan, and the United Kingdom. Finally, the overall results suggest that globalization is a more effective tool than financial development in regulating ecological footprint for G7 countries. Therefore, we recommend that policymakers should make use of the opportunities that globalization offers to solve environmental problems."

Yet, existing reviews remain limited due to the piecemeal insights offered through a sub-set rather than the entire corpus of sustainable finance. To address this gap, this study aims to conduct a large-scale review that would provide a state-of-the-art overview of the performance and intellectual structure of sustainable finance. To do so, this study engages in a review of sustainable finance research using big data analytics through machine learning of scholarly research. In doing so, this study unpacks the most influential articles and top contributing journals, authors, institutions, and countries, as well as the methodological choices and research contexts for sustainable finance research. In addition, this study reveals insights into seven major themes of sustainable finance research, namely socially responsible investing, climate financing, green financing, impact investing, carbon financing, energy financing, and governance of sustainable financing and investing. To drive the field forward, this study proposes several suggestions for future sustainable finance research, which include developing and diffusing innovative sustainable financing instruments, magnifying and managing the profitability and returns of sustainable financing, making sustainable finance more sustainable, devising and unifying policies and frameworks for sustainable finance, tackling greenwashing of corporate sustainability reporting in sustainable finance, shining behavioral finance on sustainable finance, and leveraging the power of new-age technologies such as artificial intelligence, blockchain, internet of things, and machine learning for sustainable finance."

RCCs are usually asymptomatic; however, some patients experience headaches, visual disturbances, and endocrine disorders. The best treatment for associated endocrinopathy remains elusive. We aimed to investigate the clinical course, magnetic resonance imaging findings, and response to therapy in 10 pediatric patients with RCCs and endocrinopathy. Growth impairment and precocious puberty were observed to be prevalent. One patient with suprasellar extension of RCC underwent surgery, while the others were treated medically. Of the nine patients, seven patients showed stable cyst size, while two patients displayed reduction in cyst size. Hormone replacement and gonadotropin suppression therapy were found to be effective. Imaging and endocrine follow-ups are warranted because of the potential for changes in the cyst size and hormonal changes."

Beyond its fundamental evolutionary implications, such knowledge can guide conservation decisions for populations of conservation and management concern. Here, we investigated the genomic basis of local adaptation in the Coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) across its entire North American range. We hypothesized that extensive spatial variation in environmental conditions and the species' homing behaviour may promote the establishment of local adaptation. We genotyped 7829 individuals representing 217 sampling locations at more than 100,000 high-quality RADseq loci to investigate how recombination might affect the detection of loci putatively under selection and took advantage of the precise description of the demographic history of the species from our previous work to draw accurate population genomic inferences about local adaptation. The results indicated that genetic differentiation scans and genetic-environment association analyses were both significantly affected by variation in recombination rate as low recombination regions displayed an increased number of outliers. By taking these confounding factors into consideration, we revealed that migration distance was the primary selective factor driving local adaptation and partial parallel divergence among distant populations. Moreover, we identified several candidate single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with long-distance migration and altitude including a gene known to be involved in adaptation to altitude in other species. The evolutionary implications of our findings are discussed along with conservation applications."
818,Primary salivary acinar cell carcinoma of the parotid gland with parietal skull metastasis: A case report,"Yongkang Sun,Guangfu Di,Xiaochun Jiang,Yongkang Sun,Guangfu Di,Xiaochun Jiang","Acinar cell carcinoma of the salivary gland (AciCC) is a rare low-grade epithelial malignant tumor of the salivary gland. The primary site of the disease is often in the parotid gland, followed by the submandibular gland and small salivary gland. In the early stage of the disease, there are no obvious symptoms, most of which are slow enlargement of the mass, accompanied by local pain or discomfort, or facial paralysis involving the facial nerve. Although the disease is a low-grade malignant tumor, it is invasive to a certain extent and prone to recurrence and metastasis. The metastasis sites are usually liver, lung, stomach and other visceral organs, while the metastasis of brain and skull is rarely reported by other authors. This paper reports a case of skull tumors, unlike other skull tumors, the patients had typical clinical manifestations and imaging findings are not ideal at the same time, considering the history of patients with parotid gland tumor, in the process of diagnosis for us to produce a large disturbance, single-shot, due to the lesions in the exclusion of the patients with other diseases, we decided to surgery was performed in patients with the treatment, The patient's condition improved after surgical treatment and was diagnosed as salivary adenocarcinoma with skull metastasis by pathology. This article summarizes the diagnosis and treatment of the patient, and summarizes some of the author's treatment experience, in order to increase the understanding of the disease, improve the accuracy of diagnosis, and accumulate relevant clinical experience."
819,Re-examining the environmental kuznets curve hypothesis in the economic community of West African states: A panel quantile regression approach,"Halliru, Ahmed Malumfashi; Loganathan, Nanthakumar; Hassan, Asan Ali Golam; Mardani, Abbas; Kamyab, Hesam","This study investigates the validity of the Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) hypothesis for six West African countries over 1970-2017 while using human capital and biocapacity as additional determinants of carbon emissions. It uses the panel quantile regression method that provides robust results in case the classical econometric assumptions fail. The empirical results revealed that a U-shaped relationship between economic growth and Carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions holds in the low, middle and high-emissions countries as opposed to the inverted U-shaped EKC hypothesis. Trade openness reduces environmental performance in low-emission countries. Financial development has mixed impacts on CO2 emissions across the quantiles. While financial development enhances environmental quality in the low-emissions countries, it exerts a detrimental impact in the middle and high-emissions countries. Human capital has significantly positive effects on the lower, middle and upper quantiles. The obtained results highlight the need for raising environmental awareness and promoting green R&D. In addition, relevant incentives are required to redirect private credits towards green projects and renewable energy development. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."

Here, two types of bilayer polymer brushes composed of a hydrophilic underlying layer and a cationic surface layer [made of poly(2-aminoethyl methacrylate)] with a thickness gradient were prepared by surface-initiated atom-transfer radical polymerization. To investigate the influence of the stiffness as a mechanical property of the polymer brush on cell behavior, the underlayer was prepared from either 2-methacryloyloxyethyl phosphorylcholine or oligo(ethylene glycol) methyl ether methacrylate, with the bilayers designated as gradient poly(2-methacryloyloxyethyl phosphorylcholine)-block-poly(2-aminoethyl methacrylate) [grad-pMbA] and gradient poly(oligo[ethylene glycol] methyl ether methacrylate)-block-poly(2-aminoethyl methacrylate) [grad-pEGbA], respectively. Characterization of these surfaces was performed by spectroscopic ellipsometry, X-ray reflectivity, and determination of the zeta potential, static contact angle, and force curve. These diblock copolymer brushes with a thickness gradient helped to distinguish the effects of the mechanical and surface properties of the brushes on cell behavior. The attachment and motility of L929 fibroblasts and epithelial MCF 10A cells on the fabricated brushes were then assessed. L929 cells had a round shape on the thin surface layer of grad-pMbA and spread well on thicker areas. In contrast, MCF 10A cells spread well in areas of any thickness of either grad-pMbA or grad-pEGbA. Single MCF 10A cells migrated randomly on grad-pMbA, whereas grouped cells started to climb up along the thickness gradient of grad-pMbA. In contrast, both single and grouped MCF 10A cells migrated randomly on grad-pEGbA. These thickness gradient diblock copolymer brushes are simple, reproducible, and reasonable platforms that can facilitate practical applications of biomaterials, for example, in tissue engineering and biomaterials."
821,Are BRICS countries pollution havens? Evidence from a bootstrap ARDL bounds testing approach with a Fourier function,"Yilanci, Veli; Bozoklu, Seref; Gorus, Muhammed Sehid","The goal of this paper to determine whether the effect of foreign direct investment inflows on the environment is pollutive or pollution-reducing for BRICS countries-Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa-using annual data for the period 1982-2014. For that purpose, this study examines the long-run impact of FDI inflow and energy use on ecological footprint and its components-crop land, grazing land, forest land, fishing ground, built-up land, and carbon footprint-by introducing and utilizing the bootstrap autoregressive distributed lag model with a Fourier function (FARDL) for cointegration. The findings demonstrate that although the effect of FDI inflows on the footprints is mixed in Brazil and Russia, it is positive on environmental degradation regarding ecological footprint and carbon footprint in India. Furthermore, it is found that FDI inflows increase environmental quality in China for cropland and grazing land footprints and in South Africa for crop land, grazing land, fishing ground, and built-up footprints. Furthermore, the long-run effect of energy consumption is mostly pollutive for BRICS countries."
822,Compatibility of Achyranthes bidentata components in reducing inflammatory response through Arachidonic acid pathway for treatment of Osteoarthritis,"Zanzhu Li,Dujun Ma,Liping Peng,Yuan Li,Zhouwei Liao,Tian Yu,Zanzhu Li,Dujun Ma,Liping Peng,Yuan Li,Zhouwei Liao,Tian Yu","Achyranthes bidentate is a common traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) used in treating osteoarthritis (OA). The compatibility between effective components has now become a breakthrough in understanding the mechanism of TCM. This study aimed at determining the optimal compatibility and possible mechanism of Achyranthes bidentate for OA treatment. Results showed that the adhesion score of the OA group is higher than NC group, and showed a trend of down-regulation in the intervention group. The CHI3L1 and IL-1β in joint fluid of the OA group was significantly increased compared to the sham operation group (NC group). Group G, I, and L exhibited significantly down-regulated CHI3L1, while groups C, F, I, K, and L exhibited reduced IL-1β. Joint adhesion, damage in cartilage, and synovial tissue was found in the OA model, cartilage tissue was found recovered in groups I, J, and L, and synovial tissue was recovered in group G, I, and L. Thus, group I and L were chosen for metabolite analysis, and indole-3-propionic acid was slightly up-regulated, while koeiginequinone A, prostaglandin H2, and 1-hydroxy-3-methoxy-10-methylacridonew were down-regulated in group I and L. According to functional analysis, the arachidonic acid (AA) metabolic pathway is enriched. Down-regulated expression of vital proteins in the AA metabolism pathway, such as PGE2 and COX2 in group I and L were verified. In conclusion, Hydroxyecdysone, Oleanolic acid, Achyranthes bidentata polysaccharide at a compatibility of 0.03-μg/mg, 2.0-μg/mg, 20.0-μg/mg or 0.03-μg/mg, 2.0-μg/mg, 10.0-μg/mg, respectively, may be the optimal compatibility of Achyranthes bidentate."
823,Distributed Event-Triggered Secondary Control for Economic Dispatch and Frequency Restoration Control of Droop-Controlled AC Microgrids,"Li, Zhongwen; Cheng, Zhiping; Liang, Jing; Si, Jikai; Dong, Lianghui; Li, Shuhui","With the increasing integration of renewable and sustainable energy in microgrids, the prediction errors of these energy resources may degrade the economic efficiency of a microgrid because there is a time-scale gap between the large time-scale economic dispatch and the small time-scale frequency restoration control. In this paper, a distributed event-triggered secondary control method is proposed to deal with the economic dispatch and frequency restoration control for droop-controlled AC microgrids. The proposed control strategy can ensure economic dispatch and frequency restoration control at the same time, which reduces the operation cost of AC microgrids by bridging the time-scale gap between them. Furthermore, a simple event-triggered condition is designed to implement the proposed event-triggered secondary control, which only requires the communication between the neighboring agents when a significant change of state in the microgrid occurs, which is easy to implement and can reduce the communication burden."
824,Effects of environmental conditions on the emission and odor-active compounds from Fraxinus mandshurica Rupr,"Qifan Wang,Jun Shen,Bin Zeng,Huiyu Wang,Weidong Wang,Qifan Wang,Jun Shen,Bin Zeng,Huiyu Wang,Weidong Wang","Being one of the most common wood in furniture and decoration, Fraxinus mandshurica Rupr. (F. mandshurica) is a frequently used material for wood products. However, the resulting odor problem has not yet been solved so far. Thus, this study focused on exploring odor-active compounds and investigating the effect of environmental conditions on emission and odor attributes. F. mandshurica was studied via TD-GC-MS/O combined with microchamber. Totally, 15 kinds of key odor-active compounds were detected from F. mandshurica. The main odorous components were found to be aromatics, aldehydes and ketones, esters, alcohols and acids. Six kinds of attributes played a key role in the overall odor character of F. mandshurica. Fragrant was the predominant odor impressions, followed by vinegar and antiseptic solution. The proportion of the odor-active compounds concentration to total concentration decreased with an increase in the temperature and relative humidity, while the ratio of air exchange rate to the loading factor had little effect on this. The total concentration of F. mandshurica increased as the temperature and relative humidity increased, but these decreased as the ratio of air exchange rate to the loading factor increased, while the total odor intensity reduced with the rise in the ratio of air exchange rate to the loading factor. Time was found to be the most effective factor for eliminating emissions. Considering the environmental conditions in this study, 40 °C, 60% relative humidity and a 1.0 m3·m-2 h-1 ratio of air exchange rate to loading factor are recommended to accelerate the emission of F. mandshurica. The optimum condition was found to be higher temperature, higher relative humidity and higher ratio of air exchange rate to loading factor."

Grouper fish are also a good source of minerals, vitamins, and fats that contain essential fatty acids. Thus, the current study aims to know the effect of different proportion of hummer fish on biochemical and histopathological changes of hyperglycemic rats. Twenty-four (24) Sprague Dawley-strain male albino rats, which weighed 150 ± 10 g, were divided into four groups. One group served as the negative control (normal), while the others were rendered diabetic using alloxan. One of the diabetic groups was considered the positive control and fed a standard diet, whereas the remaining two groups were fed with a 20% and 25% hammour fish diet for 28 days. At the end of the experiment, blood samples were taken from all the rats, and their organs were removed and subjected to biochemical analysis. The results indicated that the group fed with the 25% hammour fish diet exhibited significantly lower levels of liver, kidney, and heart damage, along with lower levels of serum glucose, total cholesterol, triglycerides, LDL, GOT, GPT and ALP, as compared to the positive control. The urea and creatinine levels were significantly higher for the rats that were fed the 20% hammour fish diet than for those in the positive control. The histopathological study of the heart showed a slight improvement of the heart tissues with the increase of hammour fish intake compare to the positive control, while kidney of rat from group 4, which were fed 25% hammour fish, showed granularity of epithelial lining glomerular tufts."

In this study, groundwater samples were collected from various part of the city which separated in 12 wards. The present study contains analyses of 720 groundwater samples gathered from various tube and open wells and analyzed for fluoride and other physicochemical parameters during 2014 and 2019. The results indicated that fluoride and TDS were high and the overall water quality was poor in the study area. Gastrointestinal and other health-related issues increased due to higher TDS in east, north and northeast regions. Likewise, hierarchical cluster analysis also indicated that TDS and chloride-rich water. Fluoride concentration was observed in the range of 0.66-1.61 mg/l (2014) and 0.86-1.77 mg/l (2019) which indicates that 62% samples are unfit for drinking purpose, which could cause dental and skeletal fluorosis. The water quality index (WQI) indicated lack of excellent water in the studied area in the last half-decade. As per WQI calculation suggest that 82.12% (2014) and 69.00% (2019) of groundwater samples represent poor, very poor and unsuitable categories, whereas remaining 17.85% (2014) and 31.00% (2019) of the samples represent good category for drinking purposes in entire Vadodara, Gujarat. Marginal improvement in the groundwater quality is reported due to good rainfall in 2019. Health risks associated with high fluoride drinking water were assessed for various age groups of inhabitants such as children, infants and adults. The non-carcinogenic hazard quotient estimated by oral intake was 1.38-3.36 (2014) and 1.79-3.70 (2019) for infants; 0.69-1.68 (2014) and 0.90-1.85 (2019) for children, whereas 0.07-0.18 (2014) and 0.10-0.20 (2019) for adults. Therefore, infant and children are relatively at higher health risk due to the intake of fluoride-rich drinking water than adult in the studied region. Both indices were indicated contaminated water or closer to contamination which induced non-carcinogenic health risk on citizens. Thus, the comprehensive results of present study can be used as a baseline data and valuable tool for government authorities for long-term monitoring, health monitoring and sustainable development of Vadodara, Gujarat."

Many published articles related to COVID-19 management have highlighted the important role of the pharmacists in assuring the safe, effective, and cost-effective use of medications. During such challenging times of COVID-19 pandemic that resulted in a high demand on medical resources and healthcare providers, pharmacists are well positioned to contribute and add more efforts to the healthcare system to achieve best use of the available resources including medications and providing high quality pharmaceutical care to help the patients and support the healthcare providers. Methods: This is a retrospective chart review included all admitted adult patients with confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis from 1 March 2020 till 30 June 2020. The documented clinical pharmacist interventions were extracted from the EMR and reviewed by multiple clinical pharmacists to identify type, number, frequency, outcome, and physician's acceptance rate of documented interventions. Results: A total of 484 pharmacist interventions included in the final analysis. Antimicrobial stewardship interventions were the most reported (149, 30.8%) and antibiotics were the most reported class of medication, constituting 31.1% of the total interventions. ""Optimized therapy"" was the most commonly reported outcome (58.8%). Overall, 50.8% (246) of the interventions were rated as having ""moderate"" clinical significance using the clinical significance scoring tool. The physicians' acceptance rate was 94.7%. Conclusion: Pharmacist interventions are associated with improved communication and medication use in admitted adult patients with COVID-19. Clinical pharmacists can play a crucial role in optimizing medication use in patients with COVID-19 through prevention, identification, and resolving existing or potential drug-related problems."
828,Long-run system value of battery energy storage in future grids with increasing wind and solar generation,"Mallapragada, Dharik S.; Sepulveda, Nestor A.; Jenkins, Jesse D.","With declining costs of battery storage, there is growing interest to deploy them in power systems to provide multiple grid services that directly support integration of variable renewable energy (VRE) generation. Here, we assess the holistic system value of energy storage in future grids with increasing wind and solar generation. We also identify the major sources of storage value and their dynamics under different system settings and at increasing storage and wind and solar penetration levels. We use a high temporal resolution capacity expansion model to study least-cost integration of storage in two variants of an abstract power system that is populated with load and VRE profiles consistent with the U.S. Northeast (North) and Texas (South) regions. For both systems, storage value originates primarily from deferring investments in generation capacity (VRE, natural gas) and transmission, and generally declines with increasing storage penetration. Increasing VRE penetration from 40% to 60% increases the value of storage, but only enough to make storage capacity up to 4% of peak demand cost-effective at current Lithium-ion capital costs. With future capital costs of $150/kWh for 4 h duration storage, the cost-effective storage penetration ranges between 4% and 16% of peak demand across the system scenarios studied here. Storage substitution of natural gas capacity is dependent on the VRE resource mix and penetration level, but is less than 1 GW per GW of storage added for the durations (2, 4 or 8 h) considered here. Increasing storage duration increases storage value in some cases, but this increase in value may be insufficient to compensate for the increase in capital cost per kW even under the future cost scenario."
829,"Associations between sociodemographic factors, health spending, disease burden, and life expectancy of older adults (70 + years old) in 22 countries in the Western Pacific Region, 1995-2019: estimates from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) Study 2019","Alex Molassiotis,Stephen W H Kwok,Angela Y M Leung,Stefanos Tyrovolas,Alex Molassiotis,Stephen W H Kwok,Angela Y M Leung,Stefanos Tyrovolas","The needs of the aging populations are putting increasing burden on healthcare particularly in the Western Pacific Region (WPR), which is the home of aging economies such as Hong Kong and Japan alongside rapid increases in older people in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). However, little is known about the associations between sociodemographic factors, disease burden, and life expectancy in WPR. The current study conducted secondary analysis on the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) estimates of populations aged 70 years and older in WPR countries between 1995 and 2019. Correlation tests, linear mixed regressions and generalized additive mixture models were run to examine the associations of interest. Unsupervised machine learning was conducted to segment the data automatically, at cluster analysis. The sociodemographic development index was found an important factor to the disease burden in terms of Years Lived with Disability (YLD) rate and mortality rate among older adults. YLD rate and mortality rate of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) attributable to different risk groups were significant contributors to higher expectation of Lost Healthy Years (LHE) and shorter life expectancy respectively in the context of rising YLD rate, particularly in LMICs. Three clusters of countries with similar characteristics were identified. NCDs were the most significant contributors to shorter life expectancy within which the time living in poor health did not improve. Better management of NCDs in aging populations should be emphasized in all countries. The country clusters may help in a more regional strategic planning."

In hybrid supercapacitors, battery electrodes need to have large absolute capacities while displaying high cycling stability. However, enhancing areal capacity via decreasing the size of electrode materials results in reductions in cycling stability. To balance the capacity-stability trade-off, rationally designed proper electrode structures are in urgent need and still of great challenge. Here we report a high-capacity and high cycling stability electrode material by developing a nickel phosphate lamination structure with ultrathin nanosheets as building blocks. The nickel phosphate lamination electrode material exhibits a large specific capacity of 473.9 C g-1 (131.6 mAh g-1, 1053 F g-1) at 2.0 A g-1 and only about 21% capacity loss at 15 A g-1 (375 C g-1, 104.2 mAh g-1, 833.3 F g-1) in 6.0 M KOH. Furthermore, hybrid supercapacitors are constructed with nickel phosphate lamination and activated carbon (AC), possessing high energy density (42.1 Wh kg-1 at 160 W kg-1) as well as long cycle life (almost 100% capacity retention after 1000 cycles and 94% retention after 8000 cycles). The electrochemical performance of the nickel phosphate lamination structure not only is commensurate with the nanostructure or ultrathin materials carefully designed in supercapacitors but also has a longer cycling lifespan than them.

According to the empirical findings of the autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) bounds testing procedure, although increases in per capita GDP and per capita energy consumption increase per capita CO2 emissions, per capita renewable energy consumption and trade openness decrease per capita CO2 emissions. Furthermore, according to the empirical results, an N-shaped relationship has been identified between per capita CO2 emissions and per capita GDP. This indicates that our empirical findings do not support the EKC hypothesis in Korea. Thus, economic growth alone is not sufficient to address environmental pollution; in response, active environmentally friendly policies should be implemented, and the energy matrix should be transformed in favor of renewable energy in Korea."
832,Large scale tropical deforestation drives extreme warming,"Zeppetello, Lucas R. Vargas; Luke's, Luke A.; Spector, June T.; Naylor, Rosamond L.; Battisti, David S.; Masuda, Yuta J.; Wolff, Nicholas H.","Accelerating deforestation rates in Earth's tropical rainforests have dramatic impacts on local public health, agricultural productivity, and global climate change. We used satellite observations to quantify the local temperature changes in deforested patches of rainforests across the tropics and found local warming larger than that predicted from more than a century of climate change under a worst-case emissions scenario. We show that the most extreme warming is typically found in large patches of deforestation; the combined effects of deforestation and climate change on tropical temperatures present a uniquely difficult challenge to the long term public health, occupational safety, and economic security of tropical populations."
833,Heterogeneous dependence between crude oil price volatility and China's agriculture commodity futures: Evidence from quantile-on-quantile regression,"Hau, Liya; Zhu, Huiming; Huang, Rui; Ma, Xiang","This paper investigates volatility dependence between global crude oil and China's agriculture futures by employing a quantile-on-quantile approach. The time-varying parameter stochastic volatility in mean model is used to evaluate the conditional volatility. The empirical results demonstrate the heterogeneous dependence between crude oil volatility and volatility in China's agricultural futures across quantiles. The absolute volatility spillover exhibits an overall increasing trend with higher quantiles of agricultural volatility, and the volatility dependence is asymmetric across violent/stable market situations. Moreover, extremely high or low quantiles of oil volatility exert a considerable influence, while crude oil volatility does not influence the agricultural volatility in the normal mode of the crude oil market. Furthermore, a high persistence is noted in the volatility dynamics, and the impacts of volatility on the returns exhibit substantial time variation. These findings could have important economic implications for portfolio managers and policymakers in different economic and financial circumstances. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."
834,How to achieve a win-win situation between economic growth and carbon emission reduction: empirical evidence from the perspective of industrial structure upgrading,"Dong, Biying; Xu, Yingzhi; Fan, Xiaomin","Over the past 40 years since China's reform and opening up, the industrial structure has undergone tremendous changes. The rapid development of the economy has been accompanied by a surge in carbon emissions. How to achieve a win-win situation for economic growth and carbon emissions reduction has aroused widespread concern from all sectors of society. Here, this paper discusses the dynamic relationship of industrial structure upgrading, economic growth, and carbon emission reduction. Results show that there is a long-term equilibrium relationship among industrial structure upgrading, economic growth, and carbon emissions. In the short term, when the three variables deviate from the long-term equilibrium state, the non-equilibrium state will be pulled back to equilibrium with the adjustment strength of - 0.0633, - 0.0097, and 0.0013. Carbon emission reduction promotes industrial structure upgrading. Industrial structure upgrading has a greater positive impact on economic growth. Industrial structure upgrading and economic growth have a negative impact on carbon emissions, thereby promoting emission reduction. And at the 10% significance level, there is a one-way Granger causality from carbon emissions to industrial structure upgrading, economic growth can cause one-way changes in carbon emissions, and industrial structure upgrading is a one-way Granger cause of economic growth. Finally, several carbon emission reduction policies are proposed promote industrial restructuring and sustainable economic development."

This study aims to determine the effect of &lt;i&gt;P. minor&lt;/i&gt; seaweed extract in various concentrations and frequencies as a biostimulant on the growth and production of soybean plants. &lt;b&gt;Materials and Methods:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;i&gt;Padina minor&lt;/i&gt; extract was applied to soybean plants with several concentrations (0, 10, 20, 30 and 40%) at three different application times. Where 1 application (2 weeks after planting), 2 applications (2 and 4 weeks after planting) and 3 applications (2, 4 and 5 weeks after planting). &lt;b&gt;Results:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;i&gt;Padina minor&lt;/i&gt; extract with a concentration of 40% with 1 application was able to increase plant height and shorten soybean harvest life. While the &lt;i&gt;P. minor&lt;/i&gt; extract with a concentration of 40% with two and three applications was able to increase the gross and dry weight of plants, the number of pods, gross and dry mass of whole seeds. &lt;b&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;i&gt;Padina minor&lt;/i&gt; seaweed extract with a concentration of 40% was able to increase the growth and production of soybean plants."
836,Interface Defect Detection and Identification of Triboelectric Nanogenerators via Voltage Waveforms and Artificial Neural Network,"Fan Shen,Zhongjie Li,Chuanfu Xin,Hengyu Guo,Yan Peng,Kai Li,Fan Shen,Zhongjie Li,Chuanfu Xin,Hengyu Guo,Yan Peng,Kai Li","To provide a robust working environment for TENGs, most TENGs are designed as sealed structures that isolate TENGs from the external environment, and thus their operating conditions cannot be directly monitored. Here, for the first time, we propose an artificial neural network for interface defect detection and identification of triboelectric nanogenerators via training voltage waveforms. First, interface defects of TENGs are classified and their causes are discussed in detail. Then we build a lightweight artificial neural network model which shows high sensitivity to voltage waveforms and low time complexity. The model takes 2.1 s for training one epoch, and the recognition rate of defect detection is 98.9% after 100 epochs. Meanwhile, the model successfully demonstrates the learning ability for low-resolution samples (100 × 75 pixels), which can identify six types of TENG defects, such as edge fracture, adhesion, and abnormal vibration, with a high recognition rate of 93.6%. This work provides a new strategy for the fault diagnosis and intelligent application of TENGs."
837,Sustainable energy transition readiness: A multicriteria assessment index,"Neofytou, H.; Nikas, A.; Doukas, H.","With climate change mainly originating from the extensive use of fossil fuels and having impacts on many aspects of life, changing the way energy is utilised constitutes a challenge that the world collectively must tackle. In this respect, all countries should implement a variety of measures focusing on energy efficiency and use of sustainable energy sources towards decarbonising their economies and achieving effective greenhouse gas emission reductions and sustainable development. Technological innovations, economic growth, societal compliance, and the regulatory and institutional frameworks constitute prominent factors that could promote, hinder or shape energy transitions as well as indicate the capacity of energy systems to be transformed. Therefore, investigating energy transitions and the extent to which countries are prepared to carry out such transitions requires the consideration of insights into multiple dimensions. This study outlines a multicriteria analysis framework to assess a country's sustainable energy transition readiness level, drawing from four pillars-social, political/regulatory, economic and technological-comprising a consistent set of eight evaluation criteria. The proposed decision analysis framework builds on the PROMETHEE II and AHP methods. Fourteen countries of different profile and level of progress towards sustainable development are evaluated and ranked, in an effort to highlight areas for improvement, and to support policymakers in designing appropriate pathways towards a greener economy."

JN856456) and B. licheniformis IBRC-M 11,319) (1.7 × 107 CFU/g) probiotic in a plant protein source (PP)-rich diet (∼70% of dietary protein derived from PP sources) on performance of Asian sea bass (Lates calcarifer) fry (initial body weight 2.97 ± 0.11 g). In this regard, six isoproteic (∼48%) diets were formulated as follows: a control (without supplementation of the additives); probiotic (only contained Bacillus spp. mixture); 5 g PA/kg diet; 10 g PA/kg diet; probiotic + 5 g PA/kg diet, and probiotic + 10 g PA/kg diet. Specific growth rate in fish fed with 10 g PA/kg (2.84 ± 0.1%) and diets contained blends of probiotic and PA (2.76 ± 0.19% in probiotic + 5 g PA, and 2.79 ± 0.04% in probiotic + 10 g PA) was better than in the control (2.45 ± 0.1%) (P < 0.05). Feed conversion ratio in fish fed with 10 g PA/kg (0.92 ± 0.12) and diets contained blends of probiotic and PA (0.94 ± 0.06 in probiotic + 5 g PA and 0.91 ± 0.02 in probiotic + 10 g PA) was better than in the control (1.24 ± 0.08) (P < 0.05). Digestive enzymes including α-amylase, total alkaline proteases, and bile salt dependent lipase activities improved in fish fed diets contained additives. The activity of glutathione-S-transferase and glutathione reductase enhanced in the liver of fish fed diets contained additives. The relative abundance of lysozyme, interleukin 1β, and insulin-like growth factor-1 genes mRNA transcript showed multifold increase in the liver of fish fed with the 10 g PA/kg and diets contained blends of probiotic and PA (P < 0.05). By considering the above mentioned results, supplementing a PP-rich diet with 10 g PA/kg diet or combination of PA and a mixture of Bacillus spp. probiotic recommended for L. calcarifer."

Cutaneous meningiomas are divided into type I (congenital), type II (ectopic), and type III (via direct extension) lesions. We present a rare case of atypical meningioma of the skin in a 71-year-old woman who presented with a painful and enlarging lesion on the left central frontal scalp. Biopsy showed bone and soft tissue with involvement of a spindle cell neoplasm, consisting of whorled nests with atypical features, including variably increased mitotic index, areas of hypercellularity, and sheeted architecture. The overall findings were consistent with an atypical meningioma (World Health Organization grade 2). Atypical meningiomas constitute only 5% to 15% of all meningiomas. Magnetic resonance imaging of the skull later demonstrated a left frontal tumor consistent with an atypical meningioma that had eroded through the skull. Dermatopathologists should consider cutaneous meningioma as a differential diagnosis of spindle-cell neoplasms of the skin and subcutaneous tissue in head and neck."
840,Feasibility assessment of the carbon emissions peak in China's construction industry: Factor decomposition and peak forecast,"Li, Bo; Han, Shuwan; Wang, Yafei; Li, Jiayuan; Wang, Yong","The carbon emissions from the construction industry have a significant impact on China's ability to successfully achieve its 2030 carbon peak target. The paper reports the feasibility of carbon peaks in China's construction industry based on two perspectives of factor decomposition and peak prediction. First, the Generalized Dividing Index Method factorizes the carbon emissions of China's construction industry from 2001 to 2017, and quantifies the contribution rate of each influent factor. Second, a baseline scenario, a low-carbon energy-saving scenario, and a technology breakthrough scenario are constructed. The carbon peaks of the China's construction industry in the three scenarios are then predicted for 2018-2045. The results are as follows: Firstly, GDP has the highest cumulative contribution rate to China's construction industry carbon emissions, and labor productivity and the output carbon intensity have a depressing effect on carbon emissions in that industry. The contribution rate of energy consumption to carbon emissions is always positive and grows year by year, whereas the energy intensity and carbon intensity of energy consumption have great potential for reducing carbon emissions in the future. The number of laborers and the per capita carbon emissions of the construction industry, the total labor force in each industry, and the proportion of the labor force in the construction industry have contributed to the carbon emissions of the construction industry. Second, under the baseline scenario, China's construction industry achieves carbon peaks in 2045, with a peak of 50,935,390 tons. Under the low-carbon energy-saving scenario, the carbon peak of the construction industry occurs in 2030, with a peak value of 31,685,580 tons. Under the technological breakthrough scenario, the carbon peak time of the construction industry is the earliest (2020), and the peak value is the lowest (29,008,400 tons). This study has important implications for the carbon peaks at the national macro level. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

It was indicated that TAMs could crosstalk with cancer cells via transferring exosomes which carrying microRNAs (miRNAs). Firstly, we found that TAMs could promote the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of EC cells and inhibit its apoptosis. Next, we further found that TAMs regulated the EMT and apoptosis of EC cells through transferring exosomes into EC cells. Then, lowly expressed miR-192-5p in TAMs-derived exosomes was proved. Moreover, our data demonstrated that upregulation of miR-192-5p in TAMs-derived exosomes could significantly promote the apoptosis of EC cells and impede its EMT. IRAK1 was proved to be a downstream target of miR-192-5p. Importantly, we indicated that miR-192-5p-overexpressed TAMs-derived exosomes regulated the EC cells apoptosis and EMT through inhibiting IRAK1/NF-κB signaling pathway. In addition, we also revealed that overexpression of miR-192-5p in TAMs-derived exosomes obviously limits the growth of tumors. Overall, in TAMs-derived exosomes, our data demonstrated that overexpression of miR-192-5p could effectively suppress the progression of EC. Our data provid a new target for EC treatment."
842,A Modular Synthesis of Substituted Cycloparaphenylenes,"Daniel Kohrs,Jonathan Becker,Hermann A Wegner,Daniel Kohrs,Jonathan Becker,Hermann A Wegner","Herein, we report a modular synthesis providing access to substituted cycloparaphenylenes (CPPs) of different sizes. A key synthon introducing two geminal ester units was efficiently prepared by [2+2+2] cycloaddition. This building block can be conveniently converted to macrocyclic precursors controlling the ring size of the final CPP. Efficient reductive aromatization through single-electron transfer provided the substituted nanohoops in a straightforward manner. The tBu ester substitution pattern enables a tube-like arrangement in the solid-state governed by van der Waals interactions that exhibits one of the tightest packings of CPPs in tube direction, thus opening new avenues in the crystal design of CPPs."

Fungicides had not been effective in the control of this disease during last few decades. In the present study, antifungal role of green synthesized zinc oxide (ZnO) and copper oxide (CuO) nanoparticles (NPs) were studied against Alternaria citri. Alternaria citri was isolated from disease fruits samples and was identified by staining with lacto phenol cotton blue. Furthermore, CuO and ZnO NPs were synthesized by utilizing the lemon peels extract as the reducing and capping agent. Nanoparticles were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) techniques. From the XRD data, the calculated size of CuO NPs was to be 18 nm and ZnO NPs was16.8 nm using Scherrer equation. The SEM analyses revealed the surface morphology of all the metal oxide NPs synthesized were rounded, elongated and or spherical in the shape. The zone of inhibition was observed to be 50 ± 0.5 mm by CuO NPs, followed by 51.5 ± 0.5 mm by ZnO NPs and maximum zone of antifungal inhibition was observed to be 53 ± 0.6 mm by mix metal oxide NPs. The results of minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum fungicidal concentration (MFC) of the synthesized nanoparticles showed that at the certain concentrations (80 mg ml-1), these NPs were capable of inhibiting the fungal growth, whereas above that specified concentrations (100 mg ml-1), NPs completely inhibited the fungal growth. Based on these findings, the green synthesized NPs can be used as alternative to fungicide in order to control the citrus black rot disease."
844,Iodinated cyanine dye-based nanosystem for synergistic phototherapy and hypoxia-activated bioreductive therapy,"Yunxia Dong,Ling Zhou,Zijun Shen,Qingming Ma,Yifan Zhao,Yong Sun,Jie Cao,Yunxia Dong,Ling Zhou,Zijun Shen,Qingming Ma,Yifan Zhao,Yong Sun,Jie Cao","Photodynamic therapy (PDT) has been applied in cancer treatment by utilizing reactive oxygen species (ROS) to kill cancer cells. However, the effectiveness of PDT is greatly reduced due to local hypoxia. Hypoxic activated chemotherapy combined with PDT is expected to be a novel strategy to enhance anti-cancer therapy. Herein, a novel liposome (LCT) incorporated with photosensitizer (PS) and bioreductive prodrugs was developed for PDT-activated chemotherapy. In the design, CyI, an iodinated cyanine dye, which could simultaneously generate enhanced ROS and heat than other commonly used cyanine dyes, was loaded into the lipid bilayer; while tirapazamine (TPZ), a hypoxia-activated prodrug was encapsulated in the hydrophilic nucleus. Upon appropriate near-infrared (NIR) irradiation, CyI could simultaneously produce ROS and heat for synergistic PDT and photothermal therapy (PTT), as well as provide fluorescence signals for precise real-time imaging. Meanwhile, the continuous consumption of oxygen would result in a hypoxia microenvironment, further activating TPZ free radicals for chemotherapy, which could induce DNA double-strand breakage and chromosome aberration. Moreover, the prepared LCT could stimulate acute immune response through PDT activation, leading to synergistic PDT/PTT/chemo/immunotherapy to kill cancer cells and reduce tumor metastasis. Both in vitro and in vivo results demonstrated improved anticancer efficacy of LCT compared with traditional PDT or chemotherapy. It is expected that these iodinated cyanine dyes-based liposomes will provide a powerful and versatile theranostic strategy for tumor target phototherapy and PDT-induced chemotherapy."
845,Association of atopic dermatitis with delinquent behaviors in US children and adolescents,"Jaya Manjunath,Nanette B Silverberg,Jonathan I Silverberg,Jaya Manjunath,Nanette B Silverberg,Jonathan I Silverberg","Childhood atopic dermatitis (AD) is associated with chronic itch, pain and sleep disturbance, which may predispose children to high-risk behaviors in their school and home environments. We examined the association between AD and delinquent/high-risk behaviors in children and adolescents. Data were analyzed from The Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study, a longitudinal birth cohort study consisting of 4898 children born in urban cities between 1998 and 2000. A 1-year history of AD was associated with ≥ 75th percentile of mean delinquent behavior scores at age 9 (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) [95% confidence interval] 1.39 [1.14-1.68]), but not age 15 (1.05 [0.86-1.29]). At age 9, a 1-year history of AD was associated with a higher number of delinquent behaviors (adjusted risk ratio [95% CI] 1.12 [1.03-1.23]). AD at ages 5 (aOR [95%CI] 1.31 [1.04-1.64]) and 9 (1.38 [1.14-1.67]) was associated with the highest quartile of mean delinquent behavior scores at ages 9 or 15. Children with AD persisting at multiple age groups had significantly increased odds of ≥ 75th percentile of mean delinquent behavior scores at age 15 (aOR [95%CI] 1.41 [1.09-1.81]). AD was found to be associated with the following delinquent problems: damaging property (aOR [95%CI] 1.38 [1.08-1.77]), cheating on a test (1.62 [1.17-2.26]), fist fight involvement (1.47 [1.21-1.79]) and school suspension (1.36 [1.08-1.71]). This study suggests that childhood AD may precede the onset of delinquent and high-risk behaviors later in childhood and adolescence."
846,A GIS-based novel approach for suitable sanitary landfill site selection using integrated fuzzy analytic hierarchy process and machine learning algorithms,"Mohd Mohsin,Sk Ajim Ali,Syed Kausar Shamim,Ateeque Ahmad,Mohd Mohsin,Sk Ajim Ali,Syed Kausar Shamim,Ateeque Ahmad","Disposal of waste without treatment is the least preferable way of sustainable solid waste management (SWM). But most cities in developing nations still use open dumps, causing negative impacts on the environment and human health. This study offered a novel approach for selecting landfill sites and sustainable SWM in Aligarh city, India. This was done through data collection, selecting models for criterion weighting, and validation. In order to prepare a landfill site suitability map, a geographic information system (GIS)-based ensemble fuzzy analytic hierarchy process-support vector machine (FAHP-SVM) and fuzzy analytic hierarchy process-random forest (FAHP-RF) models were implemented. Considering the previous studies and the study area characteristics, eighteen thematic layers were selected. The result revealed that land value; distance from residential roads, hospitals and clinics, and waste bins; and normalized difference built-up index (NDBI) have a fuzzy weight greater than 0.10, indicating significant factors. In contrast, land elevation, land slope, surface temperature, soil moisture index, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and urban classification have a zero fuzzy weight, indicating these criteria have no importance. The result further revealed that FAHP-RF with an area under curve (AUC) value of 0.91 is the more accurate model than FAHP-SVM. According to the final weight-based overlay result, seven potential landfill sites were identified, out of which three were determined as most suitable by considering current land cover, public opinions, and environmental and economic concerns. This research proposed a zonal division model based on landfill sites location for sustainable SWM in Aligarh city. However, the findings may provide a guideline to the decision-makers and planners for optimal landfill site selection in other cities of developing countries."
847,Evaluation of the efficiency and sustainability of timber-based construction,"Svajlenka, Jozef; Kozlovska, Maria","This research is focused on the much-debated issues regarding the low degree of efficiency and sustainability in the construction industry. The objective of this work is to present an evaluation of the efficiency and sustainability of buildings, and to determine, based on analyses of socio-economic research and theoretical assumptions, the degree of efficiency of modern methods of construction based on wood. The socio-economic research relies on the reports of users of completed constructions, which allowed a comparison of efficiency as perceived by users with efficiency as declared by manufacturers. The analysed constructions and the opinions of their users were identified in cooperation with various organizations operating in the wood-based construction sector and using databases of buildings already in use. A total of 160 constructions were analysed along with the opinions of their users. This comparison of the efficiency of construction systems in terms of selected sustainability parameters suggests that wood-based panel constructions constructed by a supplier company have the highest degree of efficiency. Constructions completed using a combined construction method are the least efficient (a combination of completion by a supplier firm with do it yourself completion). The work's main contribution is an innovative approach to evaluating modern methods of construction based on wood by collecting information from users, as users can give the most valuable feedback that is based on their own experience after purchasing their houses. This approach to addressing the issues allowed identification of the advantages and disadvantages of wood-based constructions, which can have a positive impact on the practices and companies in the construction sector. The presented research delivers a number of results produced by the analyses and the socio-economic research, possibly boosting awareness of the advantages of wood-based constructions in terms of sustainability.

848,Geochemistry and Cosmochemistry of Potassium Stable Isotopes,"Kun Wang,Weiqiang Li,Shilei Li,Zhen Tian,Piers Koefoed,Xin-Yuan Zheng,Kun Wang,Weiqiang Li,Shilei Li,Zhen Tian,Piers Koefoed,Xin-Yuan Zheng","Stable potassium isotopes are one of the emerging non-traditional isotope systems enabled in recent years by the advance of Multi-Collector Inductively-Coupled-Plasma Mass-Spectrometry (MC-ICP-MS). In this review, we first summarize the geochemical and cosmochemical properties of K, its major reservoirs, and the analytical methods of K isotopes. Following this, we review recent literature on K isotope applications in the fields of geochemistry and cosmochemistry. Geochemically, K is a highly incompatible lithophile element, and a highly soluble, biophile element. The isotopic fractionation of K is relatively small during magmatic processes such as partial melting and fractional crystallization, whereas during low-temperature and biological processes fractionation is considerably larger. This resolvable fractionation has made K isotopes promising tracers for a variety of Earth and environmental processes, including chemical weathering, low-temperature alteration of igneous rocks, reverse weathering, and the recycling of sediments into the mantle during subduction. Sorption and interactions of aqueous K with different clay minerals during cation exchange and clay formation are likely to be of fundamental significance in generating much of the K isotope variability seen in samples from the Earth surface and samples carrying recycled surface materials from the deep Earth. The magnitude of this fractionation is process- and mineral-dependent. Comprehensive quantification of pertinent K isotope fractionation factors is currently lacking and urgently needed. Significant fractionation during biological activities, such as plant uptake, demonstrates the potential utility of K isotopes in the study of the nutrient cycle and its relation to the climate and various ecosystems, enabling new and largely unexplored avenues for future research. Of significant importance to the cosmochemistry community, K is a moderately volatile element with large variations in K/U ratio observed among chondrites and planetary materials. As this indicates different degrees of volatile depletion, it has become a fundamental chemical signature of both chondritic and planetary bodies. This volatile depletion has been attributed to various processes such as solar nebula condensation, mixing of volatile-rich and -poor reservoirs, planetary accretional volatilization via impacts, and/or magma ocean degassing. While K isotopes have the potential to distinguish these different processes, the current results are still highly debated. A good correlation between the K isotope compositions of four differentiated bodies (Earth, Mars, Moon, and Vesta) and their masses suggests a ubiquitous volatile depletion mechanism during the formation of the terrestrial planets. It is still unknown whether any of the K isotopic variation among chondrites and differentiated bodies can be attributed to inherited signatures of mass-independent isotopic anomalies."
849,Sustainability evaluation and sensitivity analysis of district heating systems coupled to geothermal and solar resources,"Chen, Yuzhu; Wang, Jun; Lund, Peter D.","District heating systems assisted by renewable energy harness local energy sources, save fossil fuels, and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Here, geothermal and solar resources are integrated into district heating through a geothermal heat pump and an absorption heat pump by employing vapor-compressor and absorption cycles, respectively. A quantitative sustainability assessment model was constructed for the resulting hybrid district heating systems. Indicators on energy, environment, economic, and societal aspects were used to evaluate the composite sustainability index of hybrid systems with information entropy method. The results demonstrate that a district heating system coupled to compound parabolic concentrator-photovoltaic/thermal solar collector system with 100% photovoltaic coverage ratio is the ideal system for the case study when the annual cost saving ratio is given the highest impact in the composite sustainability index. A detailed analysis on the annual cost saving ratio shows that a higher ambient temperature, solar beam irradiance and grid electricity price would have a positive impact on the annual cost saving ratio. It can be concluded that the quantitative sustainability evaluation approach proposed helps to select the ideal hybrid system."
850,Performance analysis and multi-objective optimization of an integrated gas turbine/supercritical CO2 recompression/transcritial CO2 cogeneration system using liquefied natural gas cold energy,"Su, Ruizhi; Yu, Zeting; Xia, Lei; Sun, Jianan","A novel power/cooling cogeneration system integrated with a gas turbine, a supercritical CO2 recompression power system (SCRPC) and a transcritical CO2 power system (TCPC) using liquefied natural gas (LNG) cold energy is proposed and investigated. This new combined system can improve the electrical capacity of gas turbine, and it can maximize the electrical output under different gas turbine load conditions by adjusting the split ratio. A steady-state mathematical model is developed to further understand the performance of the proposed system. It is shown that under the given conditions the combined thermal efficiency and the combined exergy efficiency are 52.94% and 30.27%, respectively. And the exergy analysis shows that the exergy destruction mainly occurs in the combustor, followed by condenser and NG terminal, respectively. Parametric study shows that the engine load conditions, the turbine I inlet temperature, the SCRPC and TCPC highest pressures and the effectiveness of HTR, LTR and regenerator have significant effects on the net work output, the cooling capacity, the combined thermal and exergy efficiencics, and the capital investment cost. Furthermore, multi-objective optimizations considering both thermodynamic and economic aspects are carried out to obtain the Pareto frontier solutions for different multi-objectives, and the optimal design condition is found out by means of the TOPSIS method based on entropy weight. These findings could be helpful in improving the utilization rate of the gas turbine exhaust waste heat and thus boost the system efficiency."
851,The COVID-19 Pandemic as an Opportunity to Foster the Sustainable Development of Teaching in Higher Education,"Sa, Maria Jose; Serpa, Sandro","The COVID-19 pandemic has had profound consequences on the social, economic and cultural life at the global level. The educational dimension has also been affected in the schools' regular functioning, with the temporary closure of educational institutions, as well as the impediment of face-to-face classes. This perspective paper aims to add to the knowledge already produced on this topic, by arguing that these challenging conditions can be a pivotal moment of opportunity for reshaping higher education, with the implementation, development and diffusion, among academics and students, of digital technologies. The paper also discusses the role of leadership in the transformation of organizational culture in higher education. The methodology used to carry out this study is qualitative, and the technique employed to analyze the data collected was content analysis. Research studies, in diverse formats, already published on the COVID-19 topic and its impacts were the elected data sources. The results of this document analysis allow us to conclude that there is the need to improve the digital sustainable development in teaching in higher education, which entails profound challenges that higher education institutions need to face and overcome if they want to be at the forefront of success in the international education market. This is where the authors seek to contribute, by offering insights on the challenges-but also the opportunities-that COVID-19 poses to higher education at a time when it needs to redefine its teaching methods, leadership models, and interaction channels, by going digital towards the improvement of the sustainable development of its teaching."
852,"The Race for Lowest Costs of Electricity Production: Techno-Economic Analysis of Silicon, Perovskite and Tandem Solar Cells","Zafoschnig, Lisa Anna; Nold, Sebastian; Goldschmidt, Jan Christoph","Approaching efficiency limits for silicon photovoltaics and impressive efficiency gains for new perovskite and perovskite silicon tandem solar cells trigger the question, which technology will be the most economically attractive option in the future. With a bottom-up approach we estimate the manufacturing costs of modules based on silicon, perovskite single junction, and perovskite silicon tandem solar cells. We determine levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) based on current costs, and because the perovskite technology is not readily available yet, project as well future LCOE considering the ongoing dynamic system cost reductions. Furthermore, we use an empirical link between perovskite single junction efficiency and resulting tandem efficiency, to estimate LCOE for both technologies for a given status of the perovskite technology. We find that if the perovskite technology matures to a level within the next 5-6 years where single junction module efficiency exceed 22% and tandem device efficiency 30% using low-cost industrial scale processes, while module lifetimes are comparable to silicon, perovskite silicon tandem devices are especially promising for residential applications, while in utility installations perovskite silicon tandems and perovskite singlejunction devices promise a cost advantage over pure silicon. LCOE reductions of 10% 20% compared to pure silicon photovoltaics are possible."
853,Anatomical position of the palmar/plantar nerves at the metacarpal/metatarsal distal level in horses: An in vivo study by means of ultrasonography,"Beatriz Tofani Maia,Cynthia do Prado Vendruscolo,Anderson Fernando de Souza,André Luis do Valle De Zoppa,Beatriz Tofani Maia,Cynthia do Prado Vendruscolo,Anderson Fernando de Souza,André Luis do Valle De Zoppa","The neurovascular bundle of the equine distal cannon can dynamically vary with limb position, and this can affect the performance of low 4- or 6-point block. This study aims to identify and describe the anatomical position and variations of the lateral and medial palmar/plantar nerve at the metacarpal/metatarsal distal level in horses by ultrasonography. Eight mares underwent ultrasound examination on the lateral and medial palmar/plantar sides of the metacarpus/metatarsus. Images were obtained for measurements of the cross-sectional area of the nerve, distances between the nerve and the skin surface, branch of the suspensory ligament (SL), deep digital flexor tendon (DDFT) and superficial digital flexor tendon (SDFT) with limbs supported and elevated. The distance to the skin for forelimbs was higher on the lateral side when the limb was elevated (p < 0.001). The comparisons between supported and elevated limbs on the same side showed longer distances to the skin with the limb supported on the medial side (p < 0.001). Hindlimbs showed longer distances to the skin with the limb supported on the medial face (p = 0.027). The anatomical position of palmar/plantar nerves was similar between the lateral and medial sides of the limb, generally being in contact with the dorsal edge of DDFT. The strategy of elevating the limb during the injection of the low 4- or 6-point block can lead to a higher risk of puncture of the digital sheath."
854,Meeting the needs of patients with ultrarare diseases,"Stanley T Crooke,Stanley T Crooke","Patients with ultrarare diseases present unique challenges to the health care systems of developed economies that demand novel approaches, beginning with achieving a diagnosis and concluding with long-term treatment. The challenges derive from numbers. On the one hand, the rarity of the disease phenotypes means that the vast majority of ultrarare patients are never diagnosed, and for the fortunate few who are diagnosed, the journey to a genetic diagnosis is long and perilous. On the other hand, as more human genomes are sequenced, the number of these patients identified is growing logarithmically. Once patients are diagnosed, personalized medicines must be rapidly developed and delivered. Here I define the problems and propose a nonprofit model to meet the needs of some of these patients."
855,Trichodysplasia spinulosa polyomavirus small T antigen synergistically modulates S6 protein translation and DNA damage response pathways to shape host cell environment,"Deepika Narayanan,Danyal Tahseen,Brooke R Bartley,Stephen A Moore,Rebecca Simonette,Peter L Rady,Stephen K Tyring,Deepika Narayanan,Danyal Tahseen,Brooke R Bartley,Stephen A Moore,Rebecca Simonette,Peter L Rady,Stephen K Tyring","TSPyV is a viral agent linked to Trichodysplasia spinulosa, a disfiguring human skin disease which presents with hyperkeratotic spicule eruption in immunocompromised hosts. This proliferative disease state requires extensive modulation of the host cell environment. While the small T (sT) antigen of TSPyV has been postulated to cause widespread cellular perturbation, its specific substrates and their mechanistic connection are unclear. To identify the cellular substrates and pathways perturbed by TSPyV sT and propose a nuanced model that reconciles the multiple arms of TSPyV pathogenesis, changes in expression of several proteins and phospho-proteins in TSPyV sT expressing and TSPyV sT deletion mutant-expressing cell lysates were interrogated using Western blot assays. TSPyV sT expression exploits the DNA damage response pathway, by inducing hyperphosphorylation of ATM and 53BP1 and upregulation of BMI-1. Concurrently, sT dysregulates the S6 protein translation pathway via hyperphosphorylation of CDC2, p70 S6 kinase, S6, and PP1α. The S6S244/247 and p-PP1αT320 phospho-forms are points of overlap between the DDR and S6 networks. We propose a mechanistic rationale for previous reports positioning sT antigen as the key driver of TSPyV pathogenesis. We illuminate novel targets in the S6 and DDR pathways and recognize a potential synergy between these pathways. TSPyV may sensitize the cell to both unrestricted translation and genomic instability. This multi-pronged infection model may inform future therapeutic modalities against TSPyV and possibly other viruses with overlapping host substrates."
856,Techno-enviro-economic assessment of household and community energy storage in the UK,"Dong, Siyuan; Kremers, Enrique; Brucoli, Maria; Rothman, Rachael; Brown, Solomon","Residential electricity demand is expected to rise in the next few decades due to the electrification of heating and transport. Both European and UK national policies suggest that efforts should be made to reduce carbon emissions and increase the share of renewable energy, an important element of which is encouraging generation, typically PV, in partnership with energy storage systems in the residential sector. The scale of the energy storage system is important, i.e. in individual properties or as a community resource. Many advantages of community energy storage (CES) over household energy storage (HES) have been identified, but the design and operation of CES has received significantly less attention. Most existing research has analysed CES at community level only, but the performance and impact on individual households has yet to be fully explored. In this study an agent-based model is proposed to investigate and analyse CES based on a range of criteria. Results indicate that both HES and CES can significantly reduce the grid peak power import and export, improve the community self-consumption rate (SCR) and self-sufficiency rate (SSR), and contribute to much higher energy saving. Furthermore, optimising the CES capacity leads to more effective use of PV power and better demand localisation during high PV-generation periods. It is found that an important challenge for CES systems is to realise the value of the shared electricity equitably amongst the participants and potentially to seek other revenue streams."

Bacterial endophytes are important sources for production of pharmaceutically important metabolites. Berberis lycium is an important medicinal plant and there exist no report regarding isolation and determination of bioactive potential of its bacterial endophytes. Therefore the present study was aimed to isolate and identify bacterial endophytes from Berberis lycium. The study resulted in isolation of 20 strains of bacterial endophytes. Based on their antibacterial activity three strains were identified as Bacillus cereus (LBL6), Bacillus thuringiensis (SBL3) and Bacillus anthracis (SBL4) on basis of 16SrRNA gene using universal primers. Crude ethyl acetate extracts of LBL6, SBL3 and SBL4 were further evaluated for antioxidant and antifungal activities. Moderate antioxidant activity (56 %) at a concentration of 1000 µg/mL was observed for LBL6 followed by 45 and 43 % activity by SBL4 and SBL3 respectively. Significant antifungal activity was observed against Aspergillus niger (60 %) and Aspergillus flavus (56 %) at concentration of 4 mg/mL of SBL3 and SBL4 respectively. GCMS analysis of extract (LBL6) exhibited presence of 12 bioactive secondary metabolites corresponding to antimicrobial, antifungal, antioxidant, antitumor and anticancer activities. In conclusion, present study highlighted the importance of Berberis lycium to host diverse bacterial endophytes of pharmaceutical importance."

Patients & methods: This was a noninterventional, retrospective 6-month cohort study in patients refractory to at least one recommended OM, using anonymized medical care data from the German Pain eRegistry. Treatment groups were matched by propensity scoring, considering seven predefined confounding factors. The primary effectiveness end point was the absolute change in average pain intensity index from baseline at weeks 4, 12 and 24 of treatment and over the treatment period. Results: A total of 3081 datasets were retained per treatment group. LMP provided superior pain reductions and significantly greater improvements in pain-related impairments of daily living and quality of life with significantly better tolerability (p < 0.001 for all parameters) than OM. Conclusion: These real-world data confirm the effectiveness and good tolerability of LMP for l-PNP treatment under routine medical care."
859,"Behavioural changes and flight response of a mosquito (Culicidae) and an earthworm (Lumbricidae), respectively, after exposure to imidacloprid","Palesa Andile Adrena Tsotesti,Simangele Sandra Mazibuko,Ngitheni Winnie-Kate Nyoka,Sanele Michelle Mnkandla,Tanya Fouché,Patricks Voua Otomo,Palesa Andile Adrena Tsotesti,Simangele Sandra Mazibuko,Ngitheni Winnie-Kate Nyoka,Sanele Michelle Mnkandla,Tanya Fouché,Patricks Voua Otomo","A major point of concern in ecotoxicology is the effects of pesticides on nontarget organisms. This can impact the ecological role played by certain beneficial species in nature. Regarding neonicotinoid insecticides such as imidacloprid (IMI), several measures, including limited trade, restrictive use, and ban have been implemented in Europe and the USA but not globally. The goal of our study was to evaluate the potential risk of this still widely used agrochemical on the behaviour of mosquito larvae (Culicidae) and the escape behaviour of earthworms (Lumbricidae). Changes in breathing, swimming and resting were recorded in mosquitoes postexposure to 0, 1 and 2 mg IMI/L for 10 min. Earthworms were topically exposed in water for 2 minutes to 0, 5, 10 and 20 mg IMI/L. The escape behaviour (initial escape distance and speed) of the earthworms were recorded. In culicids, resting particularly was significantly increased by the exposure to imidacloprid (p < 0.05). In earthworms, the initial escape distance was statistically longer (p < 0.05) when fleeing from the 5 mg IMI/L solution than the solutions with the two highest concentrations. The worms exposed to the 5 mg IMI/L reacted faster than those exposed to the higher concentrations, which explained the long distance covered in the same amount of time. These results point to the relatively quick onset of the neurotoxic effects of imidacloprid, crippling earthworms and altering the buoyancy of mosquito larvae. The ecological consequences of these findings on the completion of life cycles and the survival of these species in nature are yet to be established."
860,A possible indicator for removal of a large foreign body from the esophagus via a cervical approach: a case report with literature review,"Yoshihiro Tanaka,Yuta Sato,Shinya Ohno,Masahide Endo,Tomonari Suetsugu,Naoki Okumura,Nobuhisa Matsuhashi,Takao Takahashi,Kazuhiro Yoshida,Yoshihiro Tanaka,Yuta Sato,Shinya Ohno,Masahide Endo,Tomonari Suetsugu,Naoki Okumura,Nobuhisa Matsuhashi,Takao Takahashi,Kazuhiro Yoshida","Foreign body intake in adults is more common among people with mental illness. Edentulous adults are at increased risk for foreign body ingestion, including of dentures. We experienced a patient who aspirated a large denture that we removed via a cervical surgical approach. A 72-year-old woman presented complaining of chest discomfort. Her medical history revealed that she suffered from schizophrenia and deafness. She had previously visited another hospital for possible loss of her denture. Chest discomfort and pain began the next day. Computed tomography showed the accidentally swallowed denture in her esophagus. Upper gastroendoscopy was attempted to remove the denture via endoscopic forceps, but it was too large to be removed and was strongly stuck. As it was difficult to perform open right thoracotomy due to left pneumonia and there was no perforation or mediastinitis, we decided to remove the denture via a left neck skin incision under general anesthesia. The denture was located in a gap between the aortic arch and vertebral body. The denture was grasped with pean forceps and extracted. The patient was discharged from hospital 18 days postoperatively. This case suggests how high a foreign body in the esophagus can be reached from a cervical incision."
861,Multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) method for assessing the sustainability of end-of-life alternatives for waste plastics: A case study of Norway,"Deshpande, Paritosh C.; Skaar, Christofer; Brattebo, Helge; Fet, Annik Magerholm","Plastic, and its pollution of marine ecosystems, has emerged as a global concern. Among the several other sources, plastics from abandoned, lost, or discarded fishing gears (ALDFG), and ropes are considered the most dangerous for marine wildlife. In EU states, the management ALDFG is prioritized through a dedicated action plan owing to the hazardous nature of ALDFG and the increase in commercial fishing activity in EU waters.The action plan demands to close the loop of plastics from fishing to ensure sustainable resource management using strategies of the circular economy (CE). Commercial fishing is a crucial sector in Norway, generating 4000 tons of waste plastic annually from fishing gears and ropes. While recycling, landfilling, and incineration are the standard end-of-life management options, the recycling industry in the region is immature. The lack of recycling capacity and inadequate infrastructure results in exporting most of the recyclable fraction out of Norway for further processing. Although within the framework of CE, the transboundary export of waste for recycling misses the opportunity to create value out of waste within the region. Therefore, in the pursuit of CE strategies, it is essential to ensure regional sustainability. In this study, we assess the environmental, economic, and social impacts of landfilling, incinerating, and recycling of waste fishing gears in Norway. To represent the current state, we include two existing recycling scenarios for the assessment, namely, recycling (inland) and recycling (export). Based on qualitative and quantitative data from relevant stakeholders, we adapted multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) to rank the end-of-life (EOL) alternatives through their ability to sustainably manage 4000 tons of waste plastics from fishing gears in Norway. The ranking and insights from stakeholder interaction were used to ascertain potential barriers in realizing principles of CE and to further recognize opportunities for establishing circular business models in the region.

862,Circadian transcription factor NPAS2 and the NAD+ -dependent deacetylase SIRT1 interact in the mouse nucleus accumbens and regulate reward,"Darius D Becker-Krail,Puja K Parekh,Kyle D Ketchesin,Shintaro Yamaguchi,Jun Yoshino,Mariah A Hildebrand,Brandan Dunham,Madhavi K Ganapathiraju,Ryan W Logan,Colleen A McClung,Darius D Becker-Krail,Puja K Parekh,Kyle D Ketchesin,Shintaro Yamaguchi,Jun Yoshino,Mariah A Hildebrand,Brandan Dunham,Madhavi K Ganapathiraju,Ryan W Logan,Colleen A McClung","Substance use disorders are associated with disruptions to both circadian rhythms and cellular metabolic state. At the molecular level, the circadian molecular clock and cellular metabolic state may be interconnected through interactions with the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+ )-dependent deacetylase, sirtuin 1 (SIRT1). In the nucleus accumbens (NAc), a region important for reward, both SIRT1 and the circadian transcription factor neuronal PAS domain protein 2 (NPAS2) are highly enriched, and both are regulated by the metabolic cofactor NAD+ . Substances of abuse, like cocaine, greatly disrupt cellular metabolism and promote oxidative stress; however, their effects on NAD+ in the brain remain unclear. Interestingly, cocaine also induces NAc expression of both NPAS2 and SIRT1, and both have independently been shown to regulate cocaine reward in mice. However, whether NPAS2 and SIRT1 interact in the NAc and/or whether together they regulate reward is unknown. Here, we demonstrate diurnal expression of Npas2, Sirt1 and NAD+ in the NAc, which is altered by cocaine-induced upregulation. Additionally, co-immunoprecipitation reveals NPAS2 and SIRT1 interact in the NAc, and cross-analysis of NPAS2 and SIRT1 chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing reveals several reward-relevant and metabolic-related pathways enriched among shared gene targets. Notably, NAc-specific Npas2 knock-down or a functional Npas2 mutation in mice attenuates SIRT1-mediated increases in cocaine preference. Together, our data reveal an interaction between NPAS2 and SIRT1 in the NAc, which may serve to integrate cocaine's effects on circadian and metabolic factors, leading to regulation of drug reward."
863,Evaluating the cost and carbon footprint of second-life electric vehicle batteries in residential and utility-level applications,"Kamath, Dipti; Shukla, Siddharth; Arsenault, Renata; Kim, Hyung Chul; Anctil, Annick","The volume of end-of-life automotive batteries is increasing rapidly as a result of growing electric vehicle adoption. Most automotive lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) are recycled but could be repurposed as second-life batteries (SLBs) since they have 70-80% residual capacity, which can be adequate for stationary applications. SLBs have been proposed as potential, inexpensive, low-carbon energy storage for residential and utility-level applications, with or without photovoltaics (PV). However, it is unknown whether SLBs will be better than new batteries and whether SLBs will provide similar cost and carbon emission reduction for the different stationary applications in all locations. This work compared the levelized cost of electricity and life-cycle carbon emissions associated with using SLBs and new LIBs in the US for three energy storage applications: (1) residential energy storage with rooftop PV, (2) utility-level PV firming, and (3) utility-level peak-shaving, leading to a total of 41 scenarios. SLBs reduced the levelized cost of electricity by 12-57% and carbon emissions by 7-31% compared to new LIBs in the considered applications, with higher reductions for utility-level applications. SLBs still provided benefits at the residential level when compared to rooftop PV alone by reducing the levelized cost by 15-25% and carbon emissions by 22-51%, making SLBs attractive to residential consumers as well. SLBs offer an opportunity to utilize an end-of-life product for energy storage applications, provided the uncertainty in SLB quality and availability is addressed. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

864,The income inequality and carbon emissions trade-off revisited,"Rojas-Vallejos, Jorge; Lastuka, Amy","This paper investigates the marginal effect of income inequality on carbon emissions per-capita. We use a panel consisting of 68 countries over a 50-year period from 1961 to 2010. We report estimates that support the hypothesis that there is a trade-off between carbon emissions per-capita and income inequality. This trade-off is not homogeneous across countries and depends upon the level of development measured by income per-capita. Using panel smooth transition regression, we find that this relationship is negative for countries with low to moderate income per-capita but becomes slightly positive after passing a threshold located around fifteen thousand 2011 US dollars. Moreover, the inequality elasticity of emissions per-capita is comparable in magnitude to its income elasticity. Therefore, both inequality and income levels are crucial to define policies to reduce carbon emissions. This implies a challenge to policymakers who pursue to reduce both income inequality and carbon emissions."

M.","Iraq has massive potential for electricity generation from solar energy. Because the country currently suffers from daily electricity shortages, a grid-connected PV system is an unsuitable option since the PV cannot serve the load during the electricity blackouts. This paper aims to analyze the techno-economic and environmental feasibility of a solar PV microgrid system which is able to supply the load during both grid availability and outage periods. A household in Baghdad was selected as a case study. HOMER software was used to carry out the overall analysis using five different control strategies. The results indicated that the most economical configuration was achieved by allowing the grid to charge the batteries at all rates, with a net present cost (NPC) of $29,713. A sustainability assessment revealed that preventing the grid from charging the battery resulted in the highest renewable fraction and the lowest CO2 emissions with 64.9% and 4533 kg/year, respectively. Furthermore, inserting a diesel generator to an economically optimized system was found to reduce the NPC by 11.6%, while increasing the CO2 emissions by 32.7%. This study showed that implementing this sort of project can provide clean, economical, and continuous electricity production in countries with daily blackouts. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier Ltd."

Nineteen elite rugby league players performed a one-week test-retest of SMFTIFT60. Typical Errors and ICCs were: small (<3.5%) and extremely high (>0.90) for accelerometer-derived variables; moderate (<2.5% points) and moderate to very high (0.71-0.89) for exercise and recovery heart rate (HRex and HRR, respectively). Convergent validity correlations with the 10-week pre-season change in 30-15 Intermittent Fitness Test performance were large for changes in SMFTIFT60 HRex (r = -0.57) and HRR (0.60), and very large for changes in accelerometer measures (range: -0.71 to -0.79). For sensitivity, within-player dose-response relationships between SMFTIFT60 HRex and prior 3-day training loads were negative and ranged from moderate (session ratings of perceived exertion [sRPE-TL], r = -0.34), to large (high-speed running distance, -0.51; acceleration load, -0.73) and very large (heart rate Training Impulse [TRIMP], -0.83). All other relationships were unclear or trivial to small. Physiological and accelerometer-derived measures from the SMFTIFT60 are reliable and valid for the assessment of fitness in rugby league players. Only HRex appears sensitive to acute changes in training load. The SMFTIFT60 could be a useful monitoring tool in team sports."
867,"Export trade, embodied carbon emissions, and environmental pollution: An empirical analysis of China's high- and new-technology industries","Wang, Shuhong; Tang, Yun; Du, Zehua; Song, Malin","China's export trade has been expanding steadily in recent years, significantly increasing resource consumption and environmental pollution. Highand new-technology industries are essential for achieving sustainable economic development and improving environmental quality. This study employs a multi-regional input-output model to estimate the economic benefits and environmental costs of export trade in highand new-technology industries. Then, it analyzes the impact of economic benefits and technological levels on environmental pollution using the Stochastic Impacts by Regression on Population, Affluence, and Technology model. An input-output multi-objective linear programming model and a non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II are adopted to combine economic development with environmental pollution and determine the optimal path for export trade. The results show that technological progress in China's highand new-technology industries is conducive to reducing embodied carbon emissions in developed countries while increasing emissions in developing countries. Moreover, a nonlinear three-stage accompanying relationship exists between the economic benefits and environmental costs of highand new-technology exports; this is because exports with low economic benefits generate fewer carbon emissions whereas exports with high economic benefits generate significant carbon emissions. An increase in exports with ultra-high economic benefits will generate excessive embodied carbon emissions that hinder coordinated economic-environmental development. Lastly, technological progress in the electrical and optical equipment sector can effectively promote pollution reduction; thus, it should be further developed to improve the comprehensive benefits of exports."

In this work, we stacked 9 nm-thick tellurium oxide (TeOx) and 8 nm-thick InGaSnO (IGTO) into a heterostructure at a low temperature of 150 °C. The superior photoelectric characteristics we achieved benefit from the intrinsic optical absorption range (300-1500 nm) of the hexagonal tellurium (Te) phase in the TeOx film, and photoinduced electrons are driven effectively by band alignment at the TeOx/IGTO interface under illumination. A photosensor based on our optimized heterostructure exhibited a remarkable detectivity of 1.6 × 1013 Jones, a responsivity of 84 A/W, and a photosensitivity of 1 × 105, along with an external quantum efficiency of 222% upon illumination by blue light (450 nm). Simultaneously, modest detection properties (responsivity: ∼31 A/W, detectivity: ∼6 × 1011 Jones) for infrared irradiation at 970 nm demonstrate that this heterostructure can be employed as a broadband phototransistor. Furthermore, its low-temperature processability suggests that our proposed concept might be used to design array optoelectronic devices for wide band detection with high sensitivity, flexibility, and stability."
869,An analysis of the relation between water pollution and economic growth in China by considering the contemporaneous correlation of water pollutants,"Cai, Hao; Mei, Yadong; Chen, Junhong; Wu, Zhenhui; Lan, Lan; Zhu, Di","The study of the relationship between water pollution and economic growth holds great significance for sustainable development. Under Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) hypothesis, this paper focuses attention on a Chinese context and investigates the relationship between water pollution discharge-waste water (WW), chemical oxygen demand (COD) and ammonia nitrogen (NH4-N) and economic growth-per capita Gross Domestic Production (GDPPC), based on a comparison of the results from two variable coefficient panel data modelse-a Locally Weighted Smoothed Regression Estimator and Smoothing Scatterplots Model (LOWESSM) which is a nonparametric model, and a Semi-parametric Seemingly Unrelated Regression Model (SSURM) which considers the contemporaneous correlation of water pollutants that most previous studies have ignored. The empirical results indicate that there exist differences that can be represented by the characteristics of different EKC types, or different turning points under the same EKC type and that the SSURM may be more conducive to reflecting the real relationship between water pollution and economic growth. The study also finds that there are eight types of EKC which can be categorized as ""good EKCs"" (negative monotonic shape, inverted N-shape, inverted U-shape and M-shape), ""bad EKCs"" (positive monotonic shape, N-shape and U-shape) and ""transition EKC"" (positive monotonic and flat-tailed shape) and the proportion of ""good EKCs"" in economically developed areas (71.43%) is lower than that in the less economically developed areas (76.47%) in terms of COD discharge. Results suggest that addressing the state of water pollution will not occur automatically as GDPPC increases, but requires the regulatory power of government environmental policies.

To improve the accuracy of histological assessment of PPTs, we examined the proliferative capacity of PPT cells and investigated DICER1 expression and KBTBD4 mutations. This study included 19 cases of PPTs [3 pineocytomas (PCs), 10 PPTs of intermediate differentiation (PPTID), and 6 pineoblastomas (PBs)]. Immunohistochemistry for Ki-67, PHH3, and DICER1, as well as Sanger sequencing analysis for KBTBD4 mutations, was performed using formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue specimens that were resected during surgery. Tumor cell proliferation was quantified using an image analysis software. For the PHH3 and MIB-1 indices, a significant difference was observed between the PPTIDs and PBs (P < 0.05). Loss of DICER1 was not specific for PB; 0/3 PCs (0.0%), 2/9 PPTIDs (22.2%), and 2/4 PBs (50.0%). KBTBD4 mutations were detected in 1/3 PCs (33.3%), 6/9 PPTIDs (66.7%), and 0/4 PBs (0.0%). Thus, combined application of the proliferative marker index and KBTBD4 mutation analysis may be useful for the differential diagnosis of PPTs. Furthermore, detection of KBTBD4 mutations using Sanger sequencing analysis may support the diagnosis of PPTID."
871,Do drivers of CO2 emission growth alter overtime and by the stage of economic development?,"Dong, Kangyin; Hochman, Gal; Timilsina, Govinda R.","The rapid increase in anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions in recent decades is a major concern because CO2 emissions are the main precursor of global warming. Thus, a clear understanding of the factors behind this increase is crucial for the design of policies that limit or at least stabilize global concentrations of CO2. In this study, we investigate factors driving the growth in global CO2 emissions over the last two decades (between 1997 and 2015) using the logarithmic mean Divisia index (LMDI) method. The analysis shows that economic growth is the main driver of CO2 emissions during the 1997-2015 period. Population growth is also responsible for increased CO2 emissions, mainly in low-income countries. Without lowering energy intensity and increasing the deployment of clean and renewable energy, CO2 emissions during 1997-2015 would have been almost 50% higher than the observed level. The analysis also shows that the factors driving CO2 emission growth vary among countries from different per-capita income brackets. The analysis emphasizes the need to reduce CO2 more rapidly in highly industrialized countries and to continue to support reduction of CO2 in developing countries, per the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (1992) Common But Differentiated Resposibilities."

Hexane extract of its leaves has appeared to be most active thus it is exposed to automated column chromatography. Further purification using High-performance liquid chromatography has led to isolation of active peaks, identified by Gas Chromatography-mass spectrometry, as 16-Pregnenolone and 9-Octadecenoic acid (Z)-, methyl ester. Their antimicrobial activity was confirmed via broth dilution procedure on Staphylococcus aureus, 16-Pregnenolone revealed a strong antimicrobial activity with MIC50 of 72 μg/mL whereas 9-Octadecenoic acid (Z)-, methyl ester display an MIC50 of >250 μg/mL. Present study is the first report on isolation of these compounds from Bidens bipinnata."
873,Knee subchondroplasty for management of subchondral bone cysts: a novel treatment method,"Gerald Joseph Zeng,Wei Sheng Foong,Tjiauw Tjoen Denny Lie,Gerald Joseph Zeng,Wei Sheng Foong,Tjiauw Tjoen Denny Lie","Knee subchondroplasty (SCP) is one of the most novel minimally invasive methods for treating bone marrow lesions. The literature suggests that it is safe, with few complications and good outcomes. However, no studies have documented its usage for managing large subchondral bone cysts. This article outlines a case report and details the pearls and pitfalls of SCP in treating large subchondral bone cysts. Our patient underwent arthroscopic debridement with medial femoral condyle SCP. Mild posterior extravasation of synthetic bone substitute was observed on Postoperative Day 1, which was immediately rectified on revision arthroscopy. Gradual escalation of weight bearing and good pain relief were subsequently achieved, and the patient has remained complication-free after two years. No further extravasation were observed on repeat radiography. SCP is a feasible temporising measure that may help to delay the need for bone allograft or immediate knee arthroplasty in younger patients while retaining function and delaying loss of productivity."
874,Impact of Income Distribution on Social and Economic Well-Being of the State,"Bilan, Yuriy; Mishchuk, Halyna; Samoliuk, Natalia; Yurchyk, Halyna","Income distribution can cause large-scale transformations in human resources structure, essential changes of economic outputs via its impact on life satisfaction and motivation of work. Thus, the overall objective of this research is to improve methodological tools of income distribution analysis based on identifying the links between different structural indicators of income inequality and the most essential features of social and economic well-being. We conducted comparative analysis of EU Member States and Ukraine. We used structural analysis based on two forms of income distribution-functional (share of ""labour"" in Gross domestic product - GDP) and household one (ratio of incomes measured by special decile coefficients) to identify income inequality and inconsistencies in distributive strategies. By grouping European countries according to economic well-being (described as GDP per capita) and inequality in income distribution (based on Gini coefficient), we determined apparent tendencies in distributive policies and revealed links between income distribution and connected social-economic features of well-being. We conclude that countries with the most stable and clear patterns in income distribution have distinct connections between the share of labour costs in GDP and successes in social and economic spheres, including human development level, property rights protection, GDP growth, possibilities for taxation and budgeting of social programmes."
875,Quality Management of Prehospital Airway Programs: An NAEMSP Position Statement and Resource Document,"Veer Vithalani,Samuel Sondheim,Angela Cornelius,John Gonzales,Mary P Mercer,Brooke Burton,Michael Redlener,Veer Vithalani,Samuel Sondheim,Angela Cornelius,John Gonzales,Mary P Mercer,Brooke Burton,Michael Redlener","Prehospital airway management encompasses a multitude of complex decision-making processes, techniques, and interventions. Quality management (encompassing quality assurance and quality improvement activities) in EMS is dynamic, evidence-based, and most of all, patient-centric. Long a mainstay of the EMS clinician skillset, airway management deserves specific focus and attention and dedicated quality management processes to ensure the delivery of high-quality clinical care.It is the position of NAEMSP that:All EMS agencies should dedicate sufficient resources to patient-centric, comprehensive prehospital airway quality management program. These quality management programs should consist of prospective, concurrent, and retrospective activities. Quality management programs should be developed and operated with the close involvement of the medical director.Quality improvement and quality assurance efforts should operate in an educational, non-disciplinary, non-punitive, evidence-based medicine culture focused on patient safety. The highest quality of care is only achieved when the quality management program rewards those who identify and seek to prevent errors before they occur.Information evaluated in prehospital airway quality management programs should include both subjective and objective data elements with uniform reporting and operational definitions.EMS systems should regularly measure and report process, outcome, and balancing airway management measures.Quality management activities require large-scale bidirectional information sharing between EMS agencies and receiving facilities. Hospital outcome information should be shared with agencies and the involved EMS clinicians.Findings from quality management programs should be used to guide and develop initial education and continued training.Quality improvement programs must continually undergo evaluation and assessment to identify strengths and shortcomings with a focus on continuous improvement."

877,Multi-agent evolutionary game in the recycling utilization of construction waste,"Su, Yongbo","The recycling utilization of construction waste (CW) is of great importance to reduce waste discharge and protect natural resources. This study investigated the evolutionary decision making process and stable strategies among three stakeholders, including the government agency (GA), waste recycler (WR) and waste producer (WP), involved in CW recycling industry based on the game theory. The main factors that affected the strategies of the stakeholders were analyzed and the tripartite evolutionary game model is provided. The evolutionary stability strategy and stability conditions were analyzed subsequently. A numerical simulation illustrated the effectiveness of the proposed method, with which the evolutionary decision making process and stable strategies among the three stakeholders are simulated. It is shown that the GA plays different roles in different stages of the development of CW recycling industry. In the early stage, the supervision and policies of the GA are critical to improve the proportion of enterprises that implement the recycling strategy. With the mature of the CW recycling industry, it is profitable for enterprises to implement waste recycling, and a high proportion of enterprises choose to implement recycling strategy. Under this circumstance, the GA will gradually decrease their interventions to enterprises, and finally evolve into no supervision. Besides, it also concludes that low penalties and subsidies are not conducive to the evolution of the optimal strategy among the three participants, and excessive supervision costs will reduce the regulatory willingness of the GA, hindering the enthusiasm of WRs and WPs to implement the recycling strategy.

878,Economic analysis of grid-connected residential rooftop PV systems in Turkey,"Duman, A. Can; Guler, Onder","This study presents an economic analysis of grid-connected residential rooftop PVs in Turkey under the current feed-in tariff (FiT) scheme. Three solar parts are formed on the solar map of Turkey to discuss the effect of solar radiation differences between regions on the feasibility of the systems. Nine provinces are selected for a nationwide analysis. 5 kW rooftop PVs are simulated using HOMER Grid. Discounted Payback Period (DPBP), Internal Rate of Return (IRR) and Profitability Index (Pl) are used to ensure the viability of the systems from all aspects. DPBP below 8 years, IRR above 13.12%, and PI above 2 are considered feasible. The results showed that current DPBP, IRR, and Pl of the systems are in the range of 7.75-14.43 years, 13.68%-6.87%, and 2.02-1.28, respectively. The systems are attractive only in one province in the southern part, and far from being investable in the northern part. A sensitivity analysis is performed to analyze the effect of varying FiT and PV initial cost on the feasibility of the systems and make policy implications. It is recommended to increase the amount of residential PV incentives in Turkey and develop a regional support mechanism, considering solar differences between regions. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

879,"An integrated approach to the selection of municipal solid waste landfills through GIS, K-Means and multi-criteria decision analysis","Eghtesadifard, Mahmood; Afkhami, Payam; Bazyar, Arash","Selecting the proper site for disposing of solid waste is one of the serious environmental and public health concerns in metropolises. This multifaceted issue encompasses environmental, economic, social, geographical, technical, and legal criteria. Some of these criteria, however, are less influenced by experts' subjective judgments because they display scientific specifications. This study drew on a novel, integrated method for the selection of municipal solid waste (MSW) landfills in the Iranian metropolis, Shiraz; the study relied on the GIS and multi-criteria decision-making methods, which helped to reduce the number of comparisons in collecting experts' opinions, simplified the selection process, and enhanced the assessment method. The method proposed was regulated by DEMATEL and ANP. Primarily 13 criteria were identified in five groups through the Delphi method. Next, using the integrated method, the weight of each criterion was determined and was assigned to the corresponding layer in ArcGIS 10.5. By combining these layers through a fuzzy logic, the sites satisfying the disposal conditions were identified. The sites were then divided into six areas through the k-means clustering algorithm, while MOORA, WASPAS and COPRAS methods were used to discover the best sites based on their priorities. Finally, to confirm the reliability of the results, compare and verify them, and conduct sensitivity analysis on them, 13 scenarios were used."
880,"Determinants of the ecological footprint: Role of renewable energy, natural resources, and urbanization","Danis; Ulucak, Recep; Khan, Salah Ud-Din","In recent years the investigation of ecological footprint and its determinants has remained a hot issue of debate among policy analysts. But some of the important determinants of ecological footprint have not been adequately covered in the literature. The present study explores the relationship between real income, renewable energy, urbanization, natural resource rent, and ecological footprint in BRICS economies. The panel data estimators such as fully modified ordinary least squares (FMOLS) and dynamic ordinary least squares (DOLS) long-run estimators are employed for the period from 1992 to 2016 to yield reliable estimations. Empirical findings document that natural resource rent, renewable energy, and urbanization decrease ecological footprint, implying that they have a positive contribution to environmental quality. Results approve the Environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) for BRICS countries in case the ecological footprint is employed as an indicator of environmental degradation. Based on the empirical results, the study develops important policy implications for BRICS countries to achieve sustainable development targets."
881,Cleaner recycling of cathode material by in-situ thermite reduction,"Wang, Wenqiang; Zhang, Yingchao; Zhang, Lei; Xu, Shengming","The extensive application of lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) generates a large amount of hazardous spent LIBs, for which sustainable recycling is seriously required by the demand of both environmental protection and resources conservation. An environmental friendly, economic effective and industrial applicable process has been developed for spent LiNixCoyMnzO2 (x + y + z = 1) cathode recycling. Here, the current collector of aluminium preforms as the in-situ reductant of thermite reduction transforming valuable metals in LiNixCoyMnzO2 cathode into LiAlO2, Li2O, NiO, CoO, and MnO. Then, Al in the in the thermite reduction product can be removed by alkaline leaching without large amount of explosive H-2 emission. Afterwards, valuable metals of Li, Ni, Co, and Mn were effectively leached into H2SO4 solution with leaching efficiencies of 99.78%, 98.62%, 99.29% and 99.91%, respectively. Comparing with the traditional carbothermic reduction methods, this method enjoys advantages of no need for peeling off the cathode materials, none adding of carbonaceous materials, avoiding large amount of H-2 emission and lower reduction temperature. The in-situ thermite reduction process demonstrates a greener, simpler, safer, more energy conserving and industrial applicable approach for sustainable recycling of spent LIBs.

In this study, the city of Qingdao was taken as an example. We evaluated the quantitative evolution of the relationship between urbanization and the eco-environment development from 2000 to 2018 by establishing the comprehensive index system and applying it to the coupling coordination model. Results showed the following: (1) The economic urbanization and eco-environment states offer the greatest contribution to the urbanization and eco-environment systems, respectively. (2) The coupling coordination relationship between urbanization and eco-environment conforms to an S-shaped curve, and the two systems have gradually moved from a ""seriously uncoordinated and urbanization lag"" stage at the beginning into a ""good coordination and eco-environment lag"" stage by the end of the research period. (3) Finally, the economic urbanization and response subsystems are essential determinants in the coupling relationship between urbanization and eco-environment. The research results can help the government better understand the complex coupling relationship and then formulate sustainable urbanization development strategies to better balance urbanization and eco-environmental protection."
883,Analysis of China's oil and gas consumption under different scenarios toward 2050: An integrated modeling,"Pan, Xunzhang; Wang, Lining; Dai, Jiaquan; Zhang, Qi; Peng, Tianduo; Chen, Wenying","China's oil and gas consumption, which is not only significant to the industry but also related with national energy security, faces uncertainties in the future. This paper analyzes China's oil and gas consumption under five representative scenarios toward 2050 using an integrated modeling. In the Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) scenario, China's oil consumption peaks at 705 million tons by 2035, and gas consumption ramps steadily up to reach 780 billion cubic meters by 2050. Oil provides 18% of China's primary energy by 2030 and 15% by 2050, and gas 14% by 2030 and 17% by 2050. The 2 degrees C and the 1.5 degrees C scenarios control China's 2050 oil consumption to 10% and 45% below the NDC level, respectively. Interestingly, more stringent mitigation tends to upscale China's gas consumption before 2040. Compared with the NDC scenario, the oil-price scenarios present limited influences on China's total energy consumption and end-use electrification but mainly feature a substitution between oil, gas and coal, non-fossil energy. Particularly, across our scenarios, China's oil import dependence is projected to largely fluctuate around 70% toward 2050, and gas import dependence to reach 50-60% beyond 2030, implying a continuously high risk of energy resource supply and national energy security.

Ethical and practical limitations on human laboratory manipulations present barriers to studying immersive threat. Furthermore, few investigations have examined group effects and concordance with subjective emotional experiences to threat. The current preregistered study measured electrodermal activity in 156 adults while they participated in small groups in a 30-min haunted-house experience involving various immersive threats. Results revealed positive associations between (a) friends and tonic arousal, (b) unexpected attacks and phasic activity (frequency and amplitude), (c) subjective fear and phasic frequency, and (d) dissociable sensitization effects linked to baseline orienting response. Findings demonstrate the relevance of (a) social dynamics (friends vs. strangers) for tonic arousal and (b) subjective fear and threat predictability for phasic arousal."
885,Structural Racism and Quantitative Causal Inference: A Life Course Mediation Framework for Decomposing Racial Health Disparities,"Nick Graetz,Courtney E Boen,Michael H Esposito,Nick Graetz,Courtney E Boen,Michael H Esposito","Quantitative studies of racial health disparities often use static measures of self-reported race and conventional regression estimators, which critics argue is inconsistent with social-constructivist theories of race, racialization, and racism. We demonstrate an alternative counterfactual approach to explain how multiple racialized systems dynamically shape health over time, examining racial inequities in cardiometabolic risk in the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health. This framework accounts for the dynamics of time-varying confounding and mediation that is required in operationalizing a ""race"" variable as part of a social process (racism) rather than a separable, individual characteristic. We decompose the observed disparity into three types of effects: a controlled direct effect (""unobserved racism""), proportions attributable to interaction (""racial discrimination""), and pure indirect effects (""emergent discrimination""). We discuss the limitations of counterfactual approaches while highlighting how they can be combined with critical theories to quantify how interlocking systems produce racial health inequities."

However, the exact underlying molecular mechanisms triggered by its inhalation have not been thoroughly investigated. We herein present a model of sub-chronic, static gasoline vapor inhalation in adult female C57BL/6 mice. Animals were exposed daily to either gasoline vapors (0.86 g/animal/90 min) or ambient air for 5 days/week over 7 consecutive weeks. At the end of the study period, toxic and molecular mechanisms underlying the inflammatory, oxidative, and apoptotic effects triggered by gasoline vapors, were examined in the lungs and liver of gasoline-exposed (GE) mice. Static gasoline exposure induced a significant increase (+21%) in lungs/body weight (BW) ratio in GE versus control (CON) mice along with a pulmonary inflammation attested by histological staining. The latter was consistent with increases in the transcript levels of proinflammatory cytokines [Interleukins (ILs) 4 and 6], respectively by ~ 6- and 4-fold in the lungs of GE mice compared to CON. Interestingly, IL-10 expression was also increased by ~ 10-fold in the lungs of GE mice suggesting an attempt to counterbalance the established inflammation. Moreover, the pulmonary expression of IL-12 and TNF-α was downregulated by 2- and 4-fold, respectively, suggesting the skewing toward Th2 phenotype. Additionally, GE mice showed a significant upregulation in Bax/Bcl-2 ratio, caspases 3, 8, and 9 with no change in JNK expression in the lungs, suggesting the activation of both intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic pathways. Static gasoline exposure over seven consecutive weeks had a minor hepatic portal inflammation attested by H&E staining along with an increase in the hepatic expression of the mitochondrial complexes in GE mice. Therefore, tissue damage biomarkers highlight the health risks associated with vapor exposure and may present potential therapeutic targets for recovery from gasoline intoxication."

There are also other consequences that have globally affected many millions at other levels, namely: Societal, political, economic, and cultural. This study aims to survey alcohol drinking throughout the pandemic so as to investigate those factors considered most relevant; i.e., sociodemographic and clinical. A longitudinal study was designed. The first (or initial) stage was completed between April 10-20 2020 on 443 subjects during the enforcement of the ""Lockdown"" in Poland. The second stage will be due in June 2020. As well as an in-house questionnaire, the study used: The Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test (AUDIT), General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-28), Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10), and the Brief COPE Inventory (Mini COPE). Alcohol was the most commonly used psychoactive substance (73%) identified. More than 30% changed their drinking habits because of the pandemic, with 16% actually drinking less, whilst 14% did so more. The former group was significantly younger than the latter. Amongst the stress-related coping strategies, it was found that current alcohol drinkers were significantly less able to find anything positive about the pandemic situation (positive reframing) and were mentally less able to cope. Those drinking more now were found to have been drinking more intensively before the pandemic started."
888,Perceptions of offsite construction in the United States: An investigation of current practices,"Razkenari, Mohamad; Fenner, Andriel; Shojaei, Alireza; Hakim, Hamed; Kibert, Charles","New offsite construction practices are emerging in the construction industry to address a broad set of productivity issues that cut across organizational, technological, and strategic domains. Despite all its benefits from sustainable and economic perspectives, offsite construction still faces significant resistance from both the construction industry and the built-environment market. Evaluating advances in this industry is critical, especially because there is a need to determine the factors that are preventing the industry from more fully and rapidly adopting offsite strategies. This paper aims to investigate the industry perspective regarding the adoption of offsite strategies and provide an understanding of the development of the offsite construction industry over time. In this regard, the ""State-of-the-Art of Modular Construction Symposium"" was held in May 2017 at the University of Florida with the intent to bring together stakeholders engaged in multi-trade prefabrication to debate the drivers, challenges and future directions of the offsite industry. During this event, data was collected by means of unstructured interviews and a questionnaire for the purpose of determining the characteristics the U.S. offsite construction industry. A SWOT framework was used to assess the strengths and weaknesses of the industry adopting offsite strategies as well as the external opportunities and threats. The questionnaire survey data analysis showed the current drivers, core elements, barriers, and possible solutions to the barriers of further implementation of offsite construction. The results are intended to help construction organizations understand the potential benefits of offsite construction and assist them in creating a roadmap for their future strategic development."
889,Heart Failure Spending Function: An Investment Framework for Sequencing and Intensification of Guideline-Directed Medical Therapies,"Larry A Allen,John R Teerlink,Stephen S Gottlieb,Tariq Ahmad,Carolyn S P Lam,Mitchell A Psotka,Larry A Allen,John R Teerlink,Stephen S Gottlieb,Tariq Ahmad,Carolyn S P Lam,Mitchell A Psotka","Heart failure with reduced ejection fraction is managed with increasing numbers of guideline-directed medical therapies (GDMT). Benefits tend to be additive. Burdens can also be additive. We propose a heart failure spending function as a conceptual framework for tailored intensification of GDMT that maximizes therapeutic opportunity while limiting adverse events and patient burden. Each patient is conceptualized to have reserve in physiological and psychosocial domains, which can be spent for a future return on investment. Key domains are blood pressure, heart rate, serum creatinine, potassium, and out-of-pocket costs. For each patient, GDMT should be initiated and intensified in a sequence that prioritizes medications with the greatest expected cardiac benefit while drawing on areas where the patient has ample reserves. When reserve is underspent, patients fail to gain the full benefit of GDMT. Conversely, when a reserve is fully spent, addition of new drugs or higher doses that draw upon a domain will lead to patient harm. The benefit of multiple agents drawing upon varied physiological domains should be balanced against cost and complexity. Thresholds for overspending are explored, as are mechanisms for implementing these concepts into routine care, but further health care delivery research is needed to validate and refine clinical use of the spending function. The heart failure spending function also suggests how newer therapies may be considered in terms of relative value, prioritizing agents that draw on different spending domains from existing GDMT."

This study attempts to reexamine the environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) hypothesis by using ecological footprint as an indicator of environmental degradation. Besides, our study aims to test the validity of environmental Phillips curve (EPC) and role of clean energy on ecological footprint. Our data cover a panel of 36 OECD countries from 1995 to 2015. We adopt the second-generation panel unit root and cointegration test to account for the presence of cross-section dependence (CSD). Moreover, the long-run relationship is estimated using Common Correlated Effect Mean Group (CCEMG) and Augmented Mean Group (AMG) that are robust to CSD. Our findings reveal that the EKC hypothesis is not valid while EPC is confirmed in OECD countries. Though there is a trade-off between unemployment and environmental degradation in OECD countries, the development of new technologies, especially in the clean energy sector, could be a key factor contributing to sustainable growth and better environmental quality. Thus, it is recommended that OECD countries should focus on the development of innovative green technologies and strengthen the initiatives that promote renewable energy consumption."

Here, western blot and qRT-PCR were carried out to measure the expression of proteins and genes, respectively. Modified neurological severity score and TTC staining were used to evaluate the brain injury of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) rats. Immunohistochemistry was performed to detect the expression of Iba-1, iNOS, and Arg-1 in tissues. Moreover, the rate of M1/M2 microglia was ensured by flow cytometry, and the concentration of pro-inflammatory factors in medium was measured using ELISA. Here, we found that miR-23a-3p is increased in human umbilical cord blood MSCs-exo. Bone marrow MSCs-exo (BMSCs-exo) could improve the injury in neuronal function and reduce the infarct size in vivo. However, the improvement of BMSCs-exo to CI was reversed by miR-23a-3p knockdown. The inhibition of BMSCs-exo to MCAO-induced microglia activation and M1 polarization and the upregulation of pro-inflammatory factors were limited by miR-23a-3p knockdown, which also confirmed in lipopolysaccharide-induced microglia. Overall, our data indicated that MSCs-exo improves CI via transferring miR-23a-3p, thus to induce the deactivation of microglia and M2 polarization. Our study revealed a new regulatory mechanism of CI."
892,Maternal mood moderates the trajectory of emotional and behavioural problems from pre- to during the COVID-19 lockdown in preschool children,"Alessandra Frigerio,Francesca Nettuno,Sarah Nazzari,Alessandra Frigerio,Francesca Nettuno,Sarah Nazzari","The COVID-19 outbreak and subsequent lockdown have dramatically impacted families' life, raising serious concerns about children's emotional wellbeing. However, few studies have investigated whether the impact of the COVID-19 lockdown on psychological adjustment in youngest can be moderated by maternal mood and, to our knowledge, none of them has adopted a longitudinal design. The main aim of the current study was to explore if the intensity and directionality of maternal mood symptoms moderated the trajectory of emotional and behavioural problems in Italian pre-schoolers from pre- to during the lockdown adopting a longitudinal design. To assess maternal anxiety and depression symptoms, the EPDS and the STAI-Y were filled in by 94 and 88 women before the lockdown, when their children were 1 (Wave P1) and 3 years old (Wave P2), respectively, and by 74 women during the lockdown, when their children were 4 years old (Wave L). Mothers also filled in the CBCL/1 ½-5 to assess their children's emotional and behavioural problems at each assessment wave. As a whole, children's emotional and behavioural problems significantly increased from pre- to during the lockdown. Furthermore, maternal mood moderated this trajectory. In particular, greater maternal mood symptoms were significantly associated with a greater increase in emotional reactive, anxious-depressed, withdrawn and aggressive symptoms during the lockdown. These results contribute to shed light on the role played by maternal emotional wellbeing in buffering the impact of the COVID-19 lockdown on children's behavioural development. Albeit preliminary, the current findings highlight the need to provide timely psychological interventions to distressed mothers to help their children to better cope with the effects of the pandemic."

The outbreaks had mortality rates of up to 22%. Escherichia coli was diagnosed as the responsible agent. Multiple-locus variable-number tandem-repeat analysis showed that all chicken isolates had identical band patterns. Core genome comparisons demonstrated that the 36 chicken isolates differed with maximum of nine nucleotides indicating that the same E. coli clone was responsible for all seven disease outbreaks despite adherence to the all-in-all production principle and rigorous cleaning and disinfection procedures.

Eco-efficiency approach offers an effective tool to uncover both the status and trends of such a transformation. This paper applied a modified eco-efficiency approach in combination with data envelopment analysis, to analyze the sustainability transition of Ulsan metropolis, Korea, under a fifteen years' promotion (2000-2015) of eco-industrial development (EID). In the design for analysis, eco-efficiency change e both at industrial park level and the regional level e was investigated to analyze whether eco-efficiency improvements at the park level coincide with those at the regional level. Our main findings were highlighted as: At the regional level, from 2000 to 2015, eco-efficiency of industrial waste generation and energy use has improved by 35.0% and 21.4%, respectively, driven by a significant reduction in waste and energy intensities attributable to technological improvements (EID promotion and urban-industrial symbiosis). At the industrial park/complex level, two national eco-industrial parks (EIPs) in Ulsan showed highest eco-efficiency (pure technical efficiency was 1.0) in analytical years, compared with nine regional industrial complexes. At both levels of analysis, EIPs stood out as eco-efficient and their contribution to urban sustainability transition was overwhelming. Moreover, EIP implementation and urban-industrial symbiosis in Ulsan were identified as the major drivers of regional EID policy. Based on our critical findings, EID was highlighted as a preventative and regenerative approach to improve eco-efficiency at the regional and industrial park level, enlightening other regional and local initiatives towards urban sustainability.

Multiple cardiac arrest airway management techniques are available to EMS clinicians including bag-valve-mask (BVM) ventilation, supraglottic airways (SGAs), and endotracheal intubation (ETI). Important goals include achieving optimal oxygenation and ventilation while minimizing negative effects on physiology and interference with other resuscitation interventions. NAEMSP recommends:Based on the skill of the clinician and available resources, BVM, SGA, or ETI may be considered as airway management strategies in OHCA.Airway management should not interfere with other key resuscitation interventions such as high-quality chest compressions, rapid defibrillation, and treatment of reversible causes of the cardiac arrest.EMS clinicians should take measures to avoid hyperventilation during cardiac arrest resuscitation.Where available for clinician use, capnography should be used to guide ventilation and chest compressions, confirm and monitor advanced airway placement, identify return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC), and assist in the decision to terminate resuscitation."

The patient was rapidly treated with steroids, immunoglobulin, and fondaparinux. She underwent within 6 h after hospital admission a mechanical thrombectomy in order to allow flow restoration in cerebral venous systems. Neuroendovascular treatment in cerebral venous thrombosis related to VITT has never been described before. It can represent a complementary tool along with the other therapies and a multidisciplinary approach."

Significant progress has been made in the understanding and modeling of atmosphere-plant-soil interactions and numerical quantification of the internal processes at plant scale. Similarly, progress has been made in ground truth information comparison and validation models. An example of this progress is the application of sUAS information using the Two-Source Surface Energy Balance (TSEB) model in commercial vineyards by the Grape Remote sensing Atmospheric Profile and Evapotranspiration eXperiment - GRAPEX Project in California. With advances in frequent sUAS data collection for larger areas, sUAS information processing becomes computationally expensive on local computers. Additionally, fragmentation of different models and tools necessary to process the data and validate the results is a limiting factor. For example, in the referred GRAPEX project, commercial software (ArcGIS and MS Excel) and Python and Matlab code are needed to complete the analysis. There is a need to assess and integrate research conducted with sUAS and surface energy balance models in a sharing platform to be easily migrated to high performance computing (HPC) resources. This research, sponsored by the National Science Foundation FAIR Cyber Training Fellowships, is integrating disparate software and code under a unified language (Python). The Python code for estimating the surface energy fluxes using TSEB2T model as well as the EC footprint analysis code for ground truth information comparison were hosted in myGeoHub site https://mygeohub.org/ to be reproducible and replicable."
898,The establishment and maintenance of dominance hierarchies,"Elizabeth A Tibbetts,Juanita Pardo-Sanchez,Chloe Weise,Elizabeth A Tibbetts,Juanita Pardo-Sanchez,Chloe Weise","Animal groups are often organized hierarchically, with dominant individuals gaining priority access to resources and reproduction over subordinate individuals. Initial dominance hierarchy formation may be influenced by multiple interacting factors, including an animal's individual attributes, conventions and self-organizing social dynamics. After establishment, hierarchies are typically maintained over the long-term because individuals save time, energy and reduce the risk of injury by recognizing and abiding by established dominance relationships. A separate set of behaviours are used to maintain dominance relationships within groups, including behaviours that stabilize ranks (punishment, threats, behavioural asymmetry), as well as signals that provide information about dominance rank (individual identity signals, signals of dominance). In this review, we describe the behaviours used to establish and maintain dominance hierarchies across different taxa and types of societies. We also review opportunities for future research including: testing how self-organizing behavioural dynamics interact with other factors to mediate dominance hierarchy formation, measuring the long-term stability of social hierarchies and the factors that disrupt hierarchy stability, incorporating phenotypic plasticity into our understanding of the behavioural dynamics of hierarchies and considering how cognition coevolves with the behaviours used to establish and maintain hierarchies. This article is part of the theme issue 'The centennial of the pecking order: current state and future prospects for the study of dominance hierarchies'."
899,Examining the linkages between electricity consumption and economic growth in African economies,"Lawal, Adedoyin Isola; Ozturk, Ilhan; Olanipekun, Ifedolapo O.; Asaleye, Abiola John","As global energy consumption continues to increase, an increasing attention is also being drawn to the need to embrace cleaner energy despite ensuring energy security and efficiency in production. This study examines the relationship between economic growth and electricity consumption in sub-Sahara African economies between 1971 and 2017. It employs the System Generalized Methods-of-Moments (System GMM) techniques so as to address the issues of endogeneity in the data generating process. We also examine whether the impact of electricity consumption differs by the level of energy intensity, by employing an advanced dynamic panel threshold regression model to ascertain the degree of threshold level of energy intensity and the potential of threshold asymmetric of energy consumption on economic growth. Our results show significant positive relationship between electricity consumption and growth, including a threshold level of energy intensity which stood at 0.48%. This suggests that energy consumption beyond 0.48% will reduce growth, while consumption below this level will stimulate growth. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."
900,Analysis of the Frequency of 10 Polymorphic Markers of CDKN2A and RB1 Genes in Russian Populations,"M V Olkova,O P Balanovsky,M V Olkova,O P Balanovsky","The study of population frequencies of rare clinically significant alleles is a prerequisite of the development of personalized medicine. We performed genotyping of 1785 DNA samples from representatives of Russian populations according to 10 benign polymorphic markers of two genes involved in oncogenesis: 3 variants of the CDKN2A gene (rs3731249, rs116150891, and rs6413464) and 7 markers of the RB1 gene (rs149800437, rs147754935, rs183898408, rs146897002, rs4151539, rs187912365, and rs144668210). Genotyping was performed using the Illumina biochip test system. The sample covered 28 populations of the Russian Federation and neighboring countries, which were later combined into 3 groups (Asian, European, and Caucasian). The information from the ALFA (NCBI) project was used as reference for the frequencies of these polymorphisms in the Asian and European populations. It was shown that rare alleles in 8 of 10 studied polymorphic markers are presented in Russian populations of European and Caucasian origin with frequencies that are tens and hundreds of times higher than the available data for Western European populations, and in Russian Asian populations, alternative alleles of 5 markers absent in the Asian population of the ALFA project were found. In the subpopulation of Astrakhan Tatars, exceptionally high frequencies of rare alleles were identified; this requires further study."
901,Prospective techno-economic and environmental assessment of a national hydrogen production mix for road transport,"Navas-Anguita, Zaira; Garcia-Gusano, Diego; Dufour, Javier; Iribarren, Diego","Fuel cell electric vehicles arise as an alternative to conventional vehicles in the road transport sector. They could contribute to decarbonising the transport system because they have no direct CO2 emissions during the use phase. In fact, the life-cycle environmental performance of hydrogen as a transportation fuel focuses on its production. In this sense, through the case study of Spain, this article prospectively assesses the techno-economic and environmental performance of a national hydrogen production mix by following a methodological framework based on energy systems modelling enriched with endogenous carbon footprint indicators. Taking into account the need for a hydrogen economy based on clean options, alternative scenarios characterised by carbon footprint restrictions with respect to a fossil-based scenario dominated by steam methane reforming are evaluated. In these scenarios, the steam reforming of natural gas still arises as the key hydrogen production technology in the short term, whereas water electrolysis is the main technology in the medium and long term. Furthermore, in scenarios with very restrictive carbon footprint limits, biomass gasification also appears as a key hydrogen production technology in the long term. In the alternative scenarios assessed, the functional substitution of hydrogen for conventional fossil fuels in the road transport sector could lead to high greenhouse gas emission savings, ranging from 36 to 58 Mt CO2 eq in 2050. Overall, these findings and the model structure and characterisation developed for the assessment of hydrogen energy scenarios are expected to be relevant not only to the specific case study of Spain but also to analysts and decision-makers in a large number of countries facing similar concerns."
902,Waste paper recycling decision system based on material flow analysis and life cycle assessment: A case study of waste paper recycling from China,"Liu, Manzhi; Tan, Shuai; Zhang, Mengya; He, Gang; Chen, Zhizhi; Fu, Zhiwei; Luan, Changjin","China's paper industry development is rapid, but the recycling rate of China's waste paper has been low all the time. Meanwhile, material flow analysis can help determine the flow of waste paper, and life cycle assessment (LCA) is the methodological framework for quantifying greenhouse gas emissions. Therefore, present study integrates these two methods into the model construction of China's waste paper recycling decision system. Present study constructs a benchmark model of China's waste paper recycling decision system in 2017, focusing on the impact of nonstandard waste paper recycling on the economic and environmental benefits of China's domestic waste paper recycling system. This model construction is followed by sensitivity analysis of the relevant parameters affecting the efficiency of the waste paper recycling system. Finally, present study forecasts the system's economic benefits and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in the context of integrating and regulating nonstandard recycling vendors. The results show that the economic benefit of China's waste paper recycling in 2017 is approximately 458.3 yuan/t and that the GHG emissions are 901.1 kgCO(2)eq. The standard recovery rate and nonstandard recovery acceptance rate will both have a significant impact on the system's economic benefits and improve the GHG emissions structure. In the context of integrating nonstandard recycling enterprises and individual recycling vendors, the economic benefits will rise to 3312.5 yuan/t in 2030, while GHG emissions will rise to 942.9 kgCO(2)eq. Present study can play a certain guiding role for policy makers in formulating waste paper recycling industry specifications and formulating relevant policies."
903,Combined overexpression of four transcription factors promotes effector T cell dedifferentiation toward early phenotypes,"Lijun Yan,Yusheng Ou,Shengfang Xia,Jianqing Huang,Wenfeng Zhang,Hongwei Shao,Han Shen,Huaben Bo,Changli Tao,Jinquan Wang,Fenglin Wu,Lijun Yan,Yusheng Ou,Shengfang Xia,Jianqing Huang,Wenfeng Zhang,Hongwei Shao,Han Shen,Huaben Bo,Changli Tao,Jinquan Wang,Fenglin Wu","Effector T cells, which are abundant but are short-lived after reinfusion into the body, are generally used for T-cell therapy, and antitumor immunity is typically not maintained over the long term. Genetic modification by early differentiated T cells and reinfusion has been shown to enhance antitumor immunity in vivo. This study overexpressed the characteristic transcription factors of differentiated early T cells by transfecting effector T cells with transcription factor recombinant lentivirus (S6 group: BCL6, EOMES, FOXP1, LEF1, TCF7, KLF7; S1 group: BCL6, EOMES, FOXP1, KLF7; S3 group: BCL6, EOMES, FOXP1, LEF1) to induce a sufficient number of effector T cells to dedifferentiate and optimize the transcription factor system. The results revealed that overexpression of early characteristic transcription factors in effector T cells upregulated the expression of early T cell differentiation markers (CCR7 and CD62L), with the S1 group having the highest expression level, while the rising trend of late differentiation marker (CD45RO) expression was suppressed. Moreover, the expression of early differentiation-related genes (ACTN1, CERS6, BCL2) was significantly increased, while the expression of late differentiation-related genes (KLRG-1) and effector function-related genes (GNLY, GZMB, PRF1) was significantly decreased; this difference in expression was more significant in the S1 group than in the other two experimental groups. The antiapoptotic ability of each experimental group was significantly enhanced, while the secretion ability of TNF-α and IFN-γ was weakened, with the effector cytokine secretion ability of the S1 group being the weakest. Transcriptomic analysis showed that the gene expression profile of each experimental group was significantly different from that of the control group, with differences in the gene expression pattern and number of differentially expressed genes in the S1 group compared with the other two experimental groups. The differentially expressed gene enrichment pathways were basically related to the cell cycle, cell division, and immune function. In conclusion, overexpression of early characteristic transcription factors in effector T cells induces their dedifferentiation, and induction of dedifferentiation by the S1 group may be more effective."
904,The role of fibroblast growth factor 8 in cartilage development and disease,"Haoran Chen,Yujia Cui,Demao Zhang,Jing Xie,Xuedong Zhou,Haoran Chen,Yujia Cui,Demao Zhang,Jing Xie,Xuedong Zhou","Fibroblast growth factor 8 (FGF-8), also known as androgen-induced growth factor (AIGF), is presumed to be a potent mitogenic cytokine that plays important roles in early embryonic development, brain formation and limb development. In the bone environment, FGF-8 produced or received by chondrocyte precursor cells binds to fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR), causing different levels of activation of downstream signalling pathways, such as phospholipase C gamma (PLCγ)/Ca2+ , RAS/mitogen-activated protein kinase-extracellular regulated protein kinases (RAS/MAPK-MEK-ERK), and Wnt-β-catenin-Axin2 signalling, and ultimately controlling chondrocyte proliferation, differentiation, cell survival and migration. However, the molecular mechanism of FGF-8 in normal or pathological cartilage remains unclear, and thus, FGF-8 represents a novel exploratory target for studies of chondrocyte development and cartilage disease progression. In this review, studies assessing the relationship between FGF-8 and chondrocytes that have been published in the past 5 years are systematically summarized to determine the probable mechanism and physiological effect of FGF-8 on chondrocytes. Based on the existing research results, a therapeutic regimen targeting FGF-8 is proposed to explore the possibility of treating chondrocyte-related diseases."
905,Optimal Whole-Life-Cycle Planning of Battery Energy Storage for Multi-Functional Services in Power Systems,"Zhang, Yongxi; Xu, Yan; Yang, Hongming; Dong, Zhao Yang; Zhang, Rui","One battery energy storage system (BESS) can provide multiple services to support electrical grid. However, the investment return, technical performance and lifetime degradation differ widely among different services. This paper proposes a novel method for the whole-life-cycle planning of BESS for providing multiple functional services in power systems. The proposed model aims to balance between extending BESS life duration and maximizing its overall revenue by strategically allocates battery capacity for each application over its whole life cycle. Specifically, BESS are initially used in ancillary service market for frequency regulation service; after certain lifetime degradation, the used batteries are transferred in energy arbitrage market for load shifting service. BESS depreciation along with the services is considered to accurately model the battery degradation effect under different marketing rules. The proposed method is tested on a modified IEEE 33-bus radial distribution system. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed method can achieve higher economic benefits and longer life span than a single application service."
906,An environment Kuznets curve for ecological footprint: Evidence from GCC countries,"Ansari, Mohd Arshad; Ahmad, Muhammad Rais; Siddique, Safeera; Mansoor, Kashif","Using country's ecological footprint, the present empirical study aims to analyze the influence of the economic growth, energy consumption, and globalization on ecological footprint in the Environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) model for the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries; namely Bahrain, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the UAE covering the period 1991-2017. By employing panel econometric approaches that considered issues of heterogeneity and cross sectional dependence, we find that all variables are first-difference stationary by using the cross-sectional augmented IPS (CIPS) and the cross-sectional augmented Dickey-Fuller (CADF) unit root tests. There exists a long-run relationship among examined variables tested by using the Westerlund cointegration tests statistics. By employing the dynamic ordinary least square (DOLS), and the fully modified ordinary least square (FMOLS), we also find that increase in the consumption of energy and globalization increases the ecological footprint, and the EKC hypothesis is not supported for the GCC countries. From the outcome of this empirical work a number of policy implications have been discussed in the study."
907,Factors affecting eco-efficiency of municipal waste services in Tuscan municipalities: An empirical investigation of different management models,"Romano, Giulia; Molinos-Senante, Maria","The efficient provision of municipal solid waste (MSW) services is essential from an economic and environmental perspective. This paper investigates the effect of ownership type on the eco-efficiency of MSW management in Tuscan municipalities. In the first stage of the analysis, the authors use a data envelopment analysis metafrontier approach with the integration of unsorted waste as an undesirable output. Three different clusters of municipalities are created based on the ownership type of the municipal waste operators: public, private, and mixed. In the second stage of analysis, the paper investigates factors affecting eco-efficiency in order to provide new knowledge that can be used by policy and decision makers to improve eco-efficiency. The results show that eco-efficiency is higher for municipalities that entrust the delivery of waste services to publicly owned firms compared to municipalities with delivery by mixed and private firms. Moreover, eco-efficiency in MSW management is higher for municipalities with younger residents, a larger population, and an overall higher population density. Smaller municipalities and those with less tourism manage their waste services more eco-efficiently than do bigger municipalities and those with more tourism. The results indicate that policy-makers should improve communication and engagement activities with older residents in smaller, less densely populated areas. In municipalities featuring heavy tourism, eco-taxes could be used to support these activities, avoiding any impact on residents. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."
908,Linkages between Psychedelics and Meditation in a Population-Based Sample in the United States,"Otto Simonsson,Simon B Goldberg,Otto Simonsson,Simon B Goldberg","There are neurophysiological and phenomenological overlaps between psychedelic and meditative states, but there is little evidence on how exposure to psychedelics might be associated with meditation-related variables. We assessed lifetime classic psychedelic use, ego dissolution during one's most intense experience using a classic psychedelic, and exposure to meditation in a representative sample (n = 953) of American adults. Those who reported experience with meditation were invited to complete a follow-up survey (n = 536, 92.1% response rate) measuring meditation-related variables. Models controlled for a range of potential confounds. Exposure to meditation was associated with lifetime classic psychedelic use and ego dissolution in covariate-adjusted models. In addition, among meditators, greater ego dissolution was associated with more frequent meditation practice. Both lifetime classic psychedelic use and ego dissolution were associated with enlightenment as motivation to practice meditation as well as lower likelihood of overall perceived barriers to meditation practice. Ego dissolution was positively associated with finding meditation more effective. Neither lifetime classic psychedelic use nor ego dissolution was associated with greater likelihood of meditation-related adverse effects. Taken together, results support potential synergy between psychedelics and meditation, but randomized controlled trials are necessary to establish safety and evaluate potential causal relationships."
909,Adaptive robust energy and reserve co-optimization of integrated electricity and heating system considering wind uncertainty,"Tan, Jin; Wu, Qiuwei; Hu, Qinran; Wei, Wei; Liu, Feng","The uncertainty and variability of wind power pose significant challenges to secure and reliable operation of power systems. Coordinated operation of the electric power system and district heating system, which can provide sufficient reserve capacity and flexibility, is an effective way to cope with the uncertainty. This paper proposes an adaptive robust energy and reserve co-optimization for the integrated electricity and heat system to minimize the total system cost under the worst-case realization of wind uncertainty considering spatial correlations of wind uncertainties. The available reserve capacity and flexibility provided by the district heating system is fully used by exploiting the regulation capabilities of combined heat and power units and electrical boilers, as well as utilizing the building thermal inertia. To reduce the conservatism of the robust solution, the spatial correlation of wind uncertainties is considered in the uncertainty set. The column-and-constraint generation algorithm is adopted to solve the adaptive robust model iteratively by reformulating the second stage with its Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions. Simulation results demonstrate that the economic efficiency is improved by utilizing the reserve flexibility from the district heating system and considering wind farm spatial correlations. Compared with the conventional single-stage optimized model, the feasibility of the two-stage robust solution is always guaranteed by considering the real-time operation constraints of the electric power system and district heating system."

The comparison of CVD associated HPIs with the entire set of HPIs can identify the pathways specific to CVDs. Therefore, topological properties of HPI networks in CVDs and all pathogens was studied using Cytoscape3.5.1. Ontology and pathway analysis were done using KOBAS 3.0. HPIs of Papilloma, Herpes, Influenza A virus as well as Yersinia pestis and Bacillus anthracis among bacteria were predominant in the whole (wHPI) and the CVD specific (cHPI) network. The central viral and secretory bacterial proteins were predicted virulent. The central viral proteins had higher number of interactions with host proteins in comparison with bacteria. Major fraction of central and essential host proteins interacts with central viral proteins. Alpha-synuclein, Ubiquitin ribosomal proteins, TATA-box-binding protein, and Polyubiquitin-C &B proteins were the top interacting proteins specific to CVDs. Signaling by NGF, Fc epsilon receptor, EGFR and ubiquitin mediated proteolysis were among the top enriched CVD specific pathways. DEXDc and HELICc were enriched host mimicry domains that may help in hijacking of cellular machinery by pathogens. This study provides a system level understanding of cardiac damage in microbe induced CVDs."

Initially, the planar structure of cremenolide was reconsidered by an individual analysis of the reported NMR spectra. Subsequently, the relative configuration was predicted using NMR calculations of all possible diastereomers based on the ωB97X-D functional. Finally, the relative configuration of cremenolide was unambiguously confirmed by preparation of the proposed structure."
912,Energy poverty in energy rich Ghana: A SWOT analytical approach for the development of Ghana's renewable energy,"Agyekum, Ephraim Bonah","Ghana has been facing cyclical erratic power supply in recent years due to increasing population, urbanization and industrialization. The country's electricity generation is hugely dependent on fossil fuels which makes the cost of electricity generation susceptible to cost of fuel on the international market and other economic factors such as exchange rate, despite the country's huge renewable energy potentials. This research used the SWOT analytical approach to assess the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats in the country's renewable energy sector. Results from the analysis shows that, geographical location, political stability and availability of Renewable Energy Act (Act 832) are the main strengths. However, issues such as complex and bureaucratic procedures in securing licenses and the high initial cost of renewable energy projects are some of the key weaknesses in the sector. The study also identified the existence of a regional integration network in the sub-region and increasing electricity demand as the major opportunities. Insufficient research and development were identified as the greatest threat to the sustainable development of the sector followed by unequal playing field and changing climatic conditions. The research therefore proposed some recommendations to the government to help in the development of the country's renewable energy sector."

In December 2019, a new infectious respiratory disease emerged in Wuhan, Hubei province, China and was named by the World Health Organization as COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019). A new class of corona virus, known as SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) has been found to be responsible for occurrence of this disease. As far as the history of human civilization is concerned there are instances of severe outbreaks of diseases caused by a number of viruses. According to the report of the World Health Organization (WHO as of April 18 2020), the current outbreak of COVID-19, has affected over 2164111 people and killed more than 146,198 people in more than 200 countries throughout the world. Till now there is no report of any clinically approved antiviral drugs or vaccines that are effective against COVID-19. It has rapidly spread around the world, posing enormous health, economic, environmental and social challenges to the entire human population. The coronavirus outbreak is severely disrupting the global economy. Almost all the nations are struggling to slow down the transmission of the disease by testing & treating patients, quarantining suspected persons through contact tracing, restricting large gatherings, maintaining complete or partial lock down etc. This paper describes the impact of COVID-19 on society and global environment, and the possible ways in which the disease can be controlled has also been discussed therein."

For the present study, we hypothesized that the transfer of hypertensive T cells (HT) or splenocytes (HS) from hypertensive donors would eliminate premenopausal protection from hypertension. Premenopausal recombination-activating gene-1 (Rag-1)-/- females received either normotensive (NT) or hypertensive cells 3 wk before ANG II infusion (14 days, 490 ng/kg/min). Contrary to our hypothesis, no increase in ANG II-induced blood pressure was observed in the NT/ANG or HT/ANG groups. Flow cytometry demonstrated that renal FoxP3+ T regulatory cells were significantly decreased, and immunohistochemistry showed an increase in renal F4/80+ macrophages in the HT/ANG group, suggesting a shift in the renal inflammatory environment despite no change in blood pressure. Renal mRNA expression of macrophage chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), endothelin-1 (ET-1), and G protein-coupled estrogen receptor-1 (GPER-1) was significantly decreased in the HT/ANG group. The adoptive transfer of hypertensive splenocytes before ANG II infusion (HS/ANG) eliminated premenopausal protection from hypertension and significantly decreased splenic FoxP3+ T regulatory cells compared with females that received normotensive splenocytes (NS/ANG). Expression of macrophage inflammatory protein 1α/chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 3 (MCP-1/CCL3), a potent macrophage chemokine, was elevated in the HS/ANG group; however, no increase in renal macrophage infiltration occurred. Together, these data show that in premenopausal females, T cells from hypertensive donors are not sufficient to induce robust ANG II-mediated hypertension; in contrast, transfer of hypertensive splenocytes (consisting of T/B lymphocytes, dendritic cells, and macrophages) is sufficient. Further work is needed to understand how innate and adaptive immune cells and estrogen signaling coordinate to cause differential hypertensive outcomes in premenopausal females.NEW & NOTEWORTHY Our study is the first to explore the role of hypertensive T cells versus hypertensive splenocytes in premenopausal protection from ANG II-induced hypertension. We show that the hypertensive status of T cell donors does not impact blood pressure in the recipient female. However, splenocytes, when transferred from hypertensive donors, significantly increased premenopausal recipient blood pressure following ANG II infusion, highlighting the importance of further investigation into estrogen signaling and immune cell activation in females."

However, attempts in improving microalgal strains to attain the ideal characteristics for biofuel application are yet to unravel. In this study, random UV-C mutagenesis was employed to generate starch-deficient mutants of indigenous Chlorella vulgaris to enhance its productivity. Out of 872 colonies, two isolated mutants (cvm5 and cvm6) were isolated and showed significant increase in cell concentrations by > 1.47-fold and > 1.04-fold, respectively. However, mutant cells exhibited smaller in size which might contributed to the significant decrease in their biomass. Moreover, gathered data revealed that the total lipid content of cvm5 was enhanced significantly (75%, > 1.3-fold increase). Additionally, triacylglycerol (TAG) content of the said mutant constitutes 48% of the dry cell weight (DCW) while cvm6 consist of 41% of the DCW. These promising and novel findings suggest that the two generated and isolated mutants are good candidates for future commercial biofuel production, especially in the Philippines. In addition, these findings may contribute on the prior knowledge of the usage of UV-C for microalgal strain development."
916,"Geochemistry of street dust in Tyumen, Russia: influence of traffic load","Dmitriy Moskovchenko,Roman Pozhitkov,Dzhamilya Ukarkhanova,Dmitriy Moskovchenko,Roman Pozhitkov,Dzhamilya Ukarkhanova","This study investigates the elemental composition, organic carbon content, pH values, and particle size characteristics in 50 road dust samples collected from Tyumen, a large city in Western Siberia (Russia). The content of 62 major and trace elements was studied using atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES) и inductively coupled plasma spectrometry (ICP-MS). It was revealed that the dust has an alkaline reaction pH = 7.4-10.2 and low organic carbon content (0.07-2.9%). The grain size distribution of the road dust samples revealed that the predominant grain size fraction was of 100-250 μm. The content of small particles (PM2 and PM10) representing the greatest environmental hazard is minimal on roads with an average traffic intensity. Studies have shown that the main road dust pollutants in Tyumen are Ni, Sb, Cr, Zn, and Co. The average geoaccumulation index (Igeo) values are ranked as Ni (2.2) > Sb (1.5) > Cr (1.3) > Zn (0.4) > Co (0.4) > Cu (0.2). The contamination evaluation through enrichment factor (EF) calculation showed that road dust is highly enriched in Ni and significantly in Cr and Sb. More than 80% of Zn, Co, and Cu and more than 90% of Ni, Sb, and Cr come from anthropogenic sources. The average concentration of Ni and Cr in the road dust of Tyumen is one order of magnitude higher than in other cities of the Earth where similar studies were carried out. The high Ni content is associated with the composition of local soils and roadways, increased content in vehicle exhaust gasses, and abrasion of metal parts. Calculations of the total enrichment index Ze showed that the level of road dust pollution in most of Tyumen's territory is hazardous."
917,Hypusinated EIF5A as a feasible drug target for Advanced Medicinal Therapies in the treatment of pathogenic parasites and therapy-resistant tumors,"Annette Kaiser,Enzo Agostinelli,Annette Kaiser,Enzo Agostinelli","Cancer drug resistance, in particular in advanced stages such as metastasis and invasion is an emerging problem. Moreover, drug resistance of parasites causing poverty-related diseases is an enormous, global challenge for drug development in the future. To circumvent this problem of increasing resistance, the development of either novel small compounds or Advanced Medicinal Therapies have to be fostered. Polyamines have many fundamental cellular functions like DNA stabilization, protein translation, ion channel regulation, autophagy, apoptosis and mostly important, cell proliferation. Consequently, many antiproliferative drugs can be commonly administered either in cancer therapy or for the treatment of pathogenic parasites. Most important for cell proliferation is the triamine spermidine, since it is an important substrate in the biosynthesis of the posttranslational modification hypusine in eukaryotic initiation factor 5A (EIF5A). To date, no small compound has been identified that directly inhibits the precursor protein EIF5A. Moreover, only a few small molecule inhibitors of the two biosynthetic enzymes, i.e. deoxyhypusine synthase (DHS) and deoxyhypusine hydroxylase (DOHH) have been functionally characterized. However, it is evident that only some of the compounds have been applied in translational approaches, i.e. in murine models to analyze the function of this modified protein in cell proliferation. In recent years, the pharmaceutical industry shifted from small molecules beyond traditional pharmacology to new tools and methods to treat disorders involving signaling deregulation. In this review, we evaluate translational approaches on inhibition of EIF5A hypusination in pathogenic parasites and therapy-resistant tumors and discuss its feasibility for an application in Advanced Medicinal Therapies."
918,Optimal timing of labour induction in contemporary clinical practice,"Nicholas Papalia,Rohan D D'Souza,Sebastian R Hobson,Nicholas Papalia,Rohan D D'Souza,Sebastian R Hobson","Induction of labour (IoL) is generally conducted when maternal and foetal risks of remaining pregnant outweigh the risks of delivery. With emerging literature around non-medically indicated IoL, contemporary clinical practice has seen an increase in IoL at 39 weeks' gestation. This review highlights recent evidence on the most common indications for IoL including gestational diabetes, hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy, and post-term pregnancies. It also summarizes the evidence related to the timing of IoL for other common conditions based on recent literature reviews."
919,"Revisiting the role of forestry, agriculture, and renewable energy in testing environment Kuznets curve in Pakistan: evidence from Quantile ARDL approach","Aziz, Noshaba; Sharif, Arshian; Raza, Ali; Rong, Kong","This paper assesses the Environmental Kuznets curve based on quantile behavior of the relationship between economic growth, forest area, agriculture production, renewable energy, and environmental degradation. The current literature generally used a single indicator to address environmental issues; however single indicator neither measures overall environmental conditions nor does specify that the environment issue is generally diminishing. Our study is the first one that used ecological footprint (EF) as an indicator to test environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) hypothesis for Pakistan by employing recent approach of quantile autoregressive distributed lag (QARDL) initiated by Cho et al. (J Econ 188(1):281-300, 2015). The result of this study validates the EKC hypothesis for Pakistan and shows quantile-dependent relationship, and in that case, using the conventional methods may somewhat lead to biased results. Moreover, the rejection of the null hypothesis of parameter constancy is also confirmed by Wald test. In the long run, the findings of renewable energy consumption and forest area show significant negative effects on ecological footprints, which indicates that by increasing renewable energy usage and forest area, ecological footprints can be minimized. Interestingly, the short-term effects of agricultural production findings on EF show statistically negative results. This illustrates that EF can also be reduced in the agriculture sector by adopting environment-friendly technologies. In order to create efficient policies for environment deterioration, the empirical findings of the current analysis can be used as a guideline for policy implications."
920,RNA N6-methyladenosine modulates endothelial atherogenic responses to disturbed flow in mice,"Bochuan Li,Ting Zhang,Mengxia Liu,Zhen Cui,Yanhong Zhang,Mingming Liu,Yanan Liu,Yongqiao Sun,Mengqi Li,Yikui Tian,Ying Yang,Hongfeng Jiang,Degang Liang,Bochuan Li,Ting Zhang,Mengxia Liu,Zhen Cui,Yanhong Zhang,Mingming Liu,Yanan Liu,Yongqiao Sun,Mengqi Li,Yikui Tian,Ying Yang,Hongfeng Jiang,Degang Liang","Atherosclerosis preferentially occurs in atheroprone vasculature where human umbilical vein endothelial cells are exposed to disturbed flow. Disturbed flow is associated with vascular inflammation and focal distribution. Recent studies have revealed the involvement of epigenetic regulation in atherosclerosis progression. N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is the most prevalent internal modiﬁcation of eukaryotic mRNA, but its function in endothelial atherogenic progression remains unclear. Here, we show that m6A mediates the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling pathway during EC activation to regulate the atherosclerotic process. Oscillatory stress (OS) reduced the expression of methyltransferase like 3 (METTL3), the primary m6A methyltransferase. Through m6A sequencing and functional studies, we determined that m6A mediates the mRNA decay of the vascular pathophysiology gene EGFR which leads to EC dysfunction. m6A modification of the EGFR 3' untranslated regions (3'UTR) accelerated its mRNA degradation. Double mutation of the EGFR 3'UTR abolished METTL3-induced luciferase activity. Adenovirus-mediated METTL3 overexpression significantly reduced EGFR activation and endothelial dysfunction in the presence of OS. Furthermore, thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1), an EGFR ligand, was specifically expressed in atheroprone regions without being affected by METTL3. Inhibition of the TSP-1/EGFR axis by using shRNA and AG1478 significantly ameliorated atherogenesis. Overall, our study revealed that METTL3 alleviates endothelial atherogenic progression through m6A-dependent stabilization of EGFR mRNA, highlighting the important role of RNA transcriptomics in atherosclerosis regulation."
921,Structure Analysis and Anti-Inflammatory Effect of a Polysaccharide from Hippocampus mohnikei,"Mingxiao Cui,Yu Wang,Kehai Liu,Mingxiao Cui,Yu Wang,Kehai Liu","The purpose of this study was to analyze the structure of a polysaccharide (HMP-1) from Hippocampus mohnikei, and to explore its anti-inflammatory effect. HMP-1 was obtained from Hippocampus mohnikei by ethanol sedimentation and secondary column chromatography purification. Its structural characteristics were analyzed by gel permeation chromatography (GPC), Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and scanning electron micrograph (SEM). Results showed its molecular weight (Mw) was 7296 Da, and it mainly consisted of six residues: 1,3-β-Glcp, 1,4-α-Manp, 1,4-α-GalpA, 1,4-β-GlcpA2S, 1,4-α-Galp3S, and 1,4-β-GlcNAc. HMP-1 could protect RAW246.7 cells from the cytotoxic effect induced by LPS. HMP-1 also could reduce the levels of nitric oxide and reactive oxygen species produced by LPS stimulation, suggesting that HMP-1 has anti-inflammatory activities within a certain concentration range."
922,Non-anaemic iron deficiency,"Shalini Balendran,Cecily Forsyth,Shalini Balendran,Cecily Forsyth","Iron deficiency without anaemia is common. Patients may present with unexplained, non-specific symptoms. Iron studies will usually show a low ferritin and low transferrin saturation with a normal haemoglobin concentration. The cause of the iron deficiency should be identified and managed. There is limited evidence about the benefits of giving iron to people who do not have anaemia. If there is iron deficiency, most people can be given oral iron supplements. Iron studies are repeated after 60-90 days of oral iron supplements. Further investigations are needed if the iron deficiency has not been corrected. Some patients, including those who have not responsed to oral supplements may benefit from intravenous iron. There is no role for intramuscular injections of iron."

924,The reduced-charge melittin analogue MelP5 improves the transfection of non-viral DNA nanoparticles,"Nathan A Delvaux,Kevin G Rice,Nathan A Delvaux,Kevin G Rice","Melittin is a 26-amino acid amphiphilic alpha-helical peptide derived from honeybee venom. Prior studies have incorporated melittin into non-viral delivery systems to effect endosomal escape of DNA nanoparticles and improve transfection efficiency. Recent advances have led to the development of two newer melittin analogues, MelP5 and Macrolittin 70, with improved pore formation in lipid bilayers while possessing fewer positive charges relative to natural melittin. Consequently, MelP5 and Macrolittin 70 were conjugated through a disulfide bond to a DNA binding polyacridine peptide. The resulting peptide conjugates were used to prepare DNA nanoparticles to compare their relative endosomolytic potency by transfection of HepG2 cells. Melittin and MelP5 conjugates were equally potent at mediating in vitro gene transfer, whereas PEGylation of DNA nanoparticles revealed improved transfection with MelP5 relative to melittin. The results demonstrate the ability to substitute a potent, reduced-charge analogue of melittin to improve overall DNA nanoparticle biocompatibility needed for in vivo testing."

To improve the feedstock quality of biodiesel, a field experiment was conducted under natural conditions. Cultivar Thori of kasumbha was used in the experiment. Commercialized biofertilizers were applied at the rate of 20 kg per acre and chemical fertilizer (diammonium phosphate) was applied as half dose (15 kg/ha). Results indicated that number of leaf plant-1, leaf area, number of seeds capitulum-1 was significantly increased by biofertilizer treatment alone (BF) and combine treatment of biofertilizer and chemical fertilizer (BFCF). Agronomic traits such as plant height, no. of branches of a plant, no. of capitulum/plant was improved significantly by BF treatment over the control. Maximum 1000 seed weight (41%) and seed yield (23%) were recorded in half dose of chemical fertilizers treatment (CFH). Seed oil content and seed phenolics were significantly improved by BF and CF treatments while maximum biodiesel yield was recorded by BF treatment. Maximum oleic acid was recorded by BF treatment while other fatty acids being maximum in control except linoleic acid in BFCF treatment. Results for specific gravity were non-significant while acid value and free fatty acid contents were substantially reduced by BF treatment as compared to other treatments. Maximum value of iodine number was recorded in BFCF treatment while tocopherol contents were improved by BF treatment. It is inferred that biofertilizer treatment alone perform better as compared to other treatments and 50% chemical fertilizer can be replaced using biofertilizer which is a good approach for sustainable environmental-friendly agriculture."

Microplastics are ubiquitous in the atmosphere, soil, and water bodies, and mostly reported in aqueous environment. This paper summarizes the abundance and types of microplastics in different aqueous environments and discusses the interactions of microplastics with other contaminants such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), antibiotics, and heavy metals. The toxicity of microplastics to aquatic organisms and microorganisms is addressed. Particularly, the combined toxic effects of microplastics and other pollutants are discussed, demonstrating either synergetic or antagonistic effects. Future prospectives should be focused on the characterization of different types and shapes of microplastics, the standardization of microplastic units, exploring the interaction and toxicity of microplastics with other pollutants, and the degradation of microplastics, for a better understanding of the ecological risks of microplastics."

H.; Rudd, Christopher D.; Wong, Kok Hoong; Lai, Nai Yeen Gavin; Mao, Jianan; Liu, Xiaoling","Wind energy has been considered as one of the greenest renewable energy sources over the last two decades. However, attention is turning to reducing the possible environmental impacts from this sector. We argue that wind energy would not be effectively ""green"" if anthropogenic materials are not given attention in a responsible manner. Using the concept of the circular economy, this paper considers how anthropogenic materials in the form of carbon fibers can reenter the circular economy system at the highest possible quality. This paper first investigates the viability of a carbon-fiber-reinforced polymer extraction process using thermal pyrolysis to recalibrate the maximum carbon fiber value by examining the effect of (a) heating rate, (b) temperature, and (c) inert gas flow rate on char yield. With cleaner and higher quality recovered carbon fibers, this paper discusses the economic preconditions for the takeoff and growth of the industry and recommends the reuse of extracted carbon fibers to close the circular economy loop.

928,Development of CaO-based adsorbents loaded on charcoal for CO2 capture at high temperature,"Gao, Ningbo; Chen, Kailun; Quan, Cui","CaO-based adsorbents have the potential to be used for CO2 capture at high temperature. However, CaO-based adsorbents exhibit a sharp decay in CO2 uptake capacity over multiple cycles, owing to the sintering of CaO particles. In this paper, a series of charcoal supported CaO-based adsorbents were developed to improve the CO2 capture performance of CaO using three different methods: physical mixing, wet impregnation and sol-gel method. The influences on CO2 capture of CaO loading and carbonation temperature are also included. The morphology and structural properties of the adsorbent were investigated by means of electron microscopy, nitrogen adsorption and XRD. It is found that the novel sorbent with an optimal mass ratio of CaO to charcoal of 4:1 prepared by the sol-gel method exhibits an initial capture capacity of 15.1 mmol g(-1) and maintains a capacity of 8.0 mmol g -1 after 15 cycles of carbonation (600 degrees C) and calcination (650 degrees C), around 60% higher than that of sol-gel CaO. The CaC-4 possesses a porous stucture with a high surface area of 63.6 m(2).g(-1) and a pore volume of 0.166 cm(3).g(-1), making CO2 diffusion easier. The XRD analysis displays that crystalline size (26 nm) of the CaO phase in CaC-4 is much smaller than that of the reference bulk CaO (96 nm), reflecting that charcoal can effectively inhibit the growth of CaO crystalline. Furthermore, the introduction of charcoal derived from biomass pyrolysis will improve the economic viability of the CO2 capture process."
929,Identifying the spatiotemporal changes of annual harvesting areas for three staple crops in China by integrating multi-data sources,"Luo, Yuchuan; Zhang, Zhao; Li, Ziyue; Chen, Yi; Zhang, Liangliang; Cao, Juan; Tao, Fulu","Reliable and continuous information on major crop harvesting areas is fundamental to investigate land surface dynamics and make policies affecting agricultural production, land use, and sustainable development. However, there is currently no spatially explicit and time-continuous crop harvesting area information with a high resolution for China. The spatiotemporal patterns of major crop harvesting areas at a national scale have rarely been investigated. In this study, we proposed a new crop phenology-based crop mapping approach to generate a 1 km harvesting area dataset for three staple crops (i.e. rice, wheat, and maize) in China from 2000 to 2015 based on GLASS leaf area index (LAI) products. First, we retrieved key phenological dates of the three staple crops by combining the inflexion- and threshold-based methods. Then, we determined the grids cultivated for a certain crop if its three key phenological dates could be simultaneously identified. Finally, we developed crop classification maps and a dataset of annual harvesting areas (ChinaCropArea1 km), comprehensively considering the characteristics of crop phenology and the references of drylands and paddy fields. Compared with the county-level agricultural statistical data, the crop classification had a high accuracy, with R-2 values consistently greater than 0.8. The spatiotemporal patterns of major crop harvesting areas during the period were further analyzed. The results showed that paddy rice harvesting areas had expanded aggressively in northeastern China but decreased in southern China. Maize harvesting areas expanded substantially in major maize cultivation areas across China. Wheat harvesting areas declined overall, although they increased notably in their major production areas. The spatiotemporal patterns could be ascribed to various anthropogenic, biophysical, and social-economic drivers, including urbanization, reduced cropping intensity in southern China, frequent disasters from climate change, and large areas of abandoned farmland in northern and southwestern China. The resultant dataset can be applied for many purposes, including land surface modeling, agro-ecosystem modeling, agricultural production and land use policy-making."

While the mechanisms by which cells selectively remove dysfunctional mitochondria, lysosomes, endoplasmic reticulum and other organelles has been well characterized, little is known about specific autophagy of damaged early endosomes. In our recent study, we uncovered a new role for RABEP1/Rabaptin5, a long-established regulator of early endosome function, in targeting the autophagy machinery to early endosomes damaged by chloroquine or by internalized Salmonella via interaction with RB1CC1/FIP200 and ATG16L1."
931,Techno-economic analysis of off-grid solar/wind/biogas/biomass/fuel cell/battery system for electrification in a cluster of villages by HOMER software,"Vendoti, Suresh; Muralidhar, M.; Kiranmayi, R.","Electrification of villages is a vital step for improving the techno-economic conditions of rural areas and crucial for the country's overall development. The villages' welfare is one of the main aims of the rural electrification programs. Rural electrification is relatively costly compared to electrification of urban areas. Now, the research question is to find the best combinations of HRES from the available resources in a given village location that can meet the electricity demand in a sustainable manner and to see whether this is a cost-effective solution or not. This study is an attempt to structure a model of electricity generation based on multiple combinations of HRES with the application of HOMER energy software at an identified off-grid village location in India. The main objectives of this study are to analyze the best-suited configuration of a hybrid RE system out of various combinations to meet the village load requirement reliably, continuously and sustainably. The study also reduces the total system net present cost and least cost of energy (COE) using multi-objective HOMER Pro software. In this study, a resource assessment and demand calculation have been carried out and the COE per unit has been ascertained for different systems and configurations. A combination of PV-Wind-Biomass-Biogas-FC along with battery has been identified as the cheapest and most dependable solution with a COE of $0.214/kWh."
932,Jordan toward a 100% renewable electricity system,"Kiwan, Suhil; Al-Gharibeh, Elyasa","Jordan has faced two major energy crises during the past two decades; the disruption of Iraqi's oil in 2003 and Egyptian's natural gas in 2011. Restructuring Jordan's electricity supply system became a national necessity to secure sustainable electricity at affordable prices. In this work, a 100% renewable electricity supply scenario is constructed and compared with three other scenarios, which contain a mix of natural gas, nuclear, oil shale and renewable energy, in terms of techno-economic feasibility, security of supply, and carbon dioxide emissions. All the proposed scenarios were found to be economically feasible. The cumulative discount production costs, over the coming thirty five years under different fuel prices assumption, is less than 80 billion dollars (2010 dollar) for all proposed scenario. In the 100% renewable electricity scenario, the country needs around 10.6 GW of concentrated solar power, 4.5 GW of wind, and 25 GW of photovoltaic to meet the demand in the year 2050 which are achievable in terms of energy resources. The dispatchability problem of the renewable scenario was solved by proposing a 90 GWh storage system (43 CSP plants, 250 MW each, 8 h storage). Furthermore, import dependency and CO2 emission will entirely disappear by 2050 in the renewable scenario. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."
933,"Effects of agriculture, renewable energy, and economic growth on carbon dioxide emissions: Evidence of the environmental Kuznets curve","Ridzuan, Nur Hilfa Awatif Mohamad; Marwan, Nur Fakhzan; Khalid, Norlin; Ali, Mohd Helmi; Tseng, Ming-Lang","This study contributes to (1) discovering that carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions are not directly influenced by modernisation; (2) attaining sustainable agriculture by incorporating renewable energy into the agriculture sector as an effective CO2 emissions mitigation measure; and (3) applying the environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) to test the relationships among attributes in Malaysia. Prior studies have not addressed the associations between the release of CO2 and economic development, renewable energy, urbanisation, and agriculture in Malaysia. Hence, the objective of the study is to investigate the relationships of the emissions of CO2 and economic development, renewable energy, urbanisation, and agricultural subsectors, such as crops, livestock, and fisheries, in Malaysia for the period 1978 to 2016. By the utilisation of the autoregressive distributed lag test for cointegration, CO2 emissions significantly increased due to economic growth and urbanisation but insignificantly increased due to livestock in the long term. Crops, fisheries, and renewable energy significantly reduced emissions in this period. Moreover, this study reveals that the association between emissions of CO2 and economic development is an inverted U. This finding indicates that CO2 emissions eventually decrease despite the increase in CO2 emissions and economic development in the long term upon reaching a specific level of growth. These findings are consistent for Malaysia in terms of the EKC hypothesis."
934,Spatiotemporal characteristics and influential factors of eco-efficiency in Chinese prefecture-level cities: A spatial panel econometric analysis,"Ren, Yufei; Fang, Chuanglin; Li, Guangdong","Eco-efficiency, which emphasizes the significance of balancing the relationship between resource input, environmental pollution, and economic growth, has aroused extensive attention worldwide. China has seen profound economic growth in the past several decades, however, this has led to challenges for energy consumption growth and environmental issues (e.g., PM2.5 concentration). Improving eco-efficiency plays an important role in achieving sustainable development in China. Here, a novel evaluation framework of eco-efficiency is established by collecting satellite-derived data. Then, a hybrid distance model, named S-EBM with undesirable outputs, is applied to measure the eco-efficiency of Chinese 283 prefecture-level cities during the period 2003-2013. Finally, the spatial externality of eco-efficiency and its driving factors are examined by using a spatial Durbin model. Given that our results show the robustness in different spatial matrix settings, the research framework is applicable to the similar areas out of China (e.g., India). The empirical results show that: (1) eco-efficiency exhibits, by and large, a geographical gradual decrease trend from relatively developed areas to developing areas, however, a few exceptions indicate that a higher economic development level does not necessarily lead to a greater eco-efficiency, and vice versa; (2) estimation results of Moran's I index and hotspot analysis suggest that positive spatial autocorrelation of eco-efficiency is gradually increasing and the spatial distribution of statistically significant high and low agglomerations is changing over time; (3) The estimation results of the spatial Durbin model show that an increase in eco-efficiency in surrounding cities will improve the value of eco-efficiency in local cities; (4) The spatial externality of explanatory variables is also found, in which financial development, foreign direct investment, environmental regulation, and spatial urbanization level in neighboring cities impact the eco-efficiency in local cities.

Even though it has been taking on increasing importance in many health fields over 10 years, telerehabilitation had yet to find its place in pulmonary rehabilitation before 2020, when the pandemic situation impelled numerous teams to put it to work. Pilot studies on respiratory diseases, primarily COPD, along with recent data from randomized or non-randomized studies, have enhanced our understanding of ""remote"" practice. In this review of the literature, we will show that pulmonary telerehabilitation is feasible, safe and likely to yield short-term (and possibly longer term) effects generally similar to those achieved in the pulmonary rehabilitation programs of specialized centers, especially as regards some indicators of exercise tolerance, dyspnea or patient quality of life. However, the number of studies and patients included in these programs remains too limited in terms of modalities, duration, long-term effects, or adaptations in case of exacerbation to be the subject of recommendations. The potential of respiratory telerehabilitation justifies continuing clinical trials and experiments, which need to be coordinated with the interventions characterizing a conventional program."

There are numerous genetical and lifestyle factors, responsible for rheumatoid arthritis. One such factor can be cysteine cathepsins, which act as proteolytic enzymes. These proteolytic enzyme gets activated at acidic pH and are found in lysosomes and are also termed as cysteine proteases. These proteases belong to papain family and have their elucidated role in musculoskeletal disorders. Numerous cathepsins have their targeted role in rheumatoid arthritis. These proteases are secreted through various cell types which includes matrix metalloproteases and papain like cysteine proteases. These proteases can potentially lead to bone and cartilage destruction which causes an immune response in case of inflammatory arthritis."

Thus, conservation has become a global challenge. In Chile, the dissociation between economic activities and conservation has triggered numerous socio-environmental conflicts in recent decades. This work explores how different projects that give rise to these conflicts can represent an underestimated threat to biodiversity. We identified socio-environmental conflicts in Chile and their associated projects by carrying out an online review of 1035 news articles published between 2004 and 2018 using the key words ""environmental conflict"". We selected articles describing a socio-environmental conflict between parties caused by a project or productive sector. Conflict-generating projects were classified by productive sector and capital origin. In addition, their geographical distribution with respect to High Conservation Value Areas (HCVAs, protected areas and priority sites for conservation) was determined. A total of 283 projects were identified from 14 different productive sectors, most of them related to energy and mining, which threaten biodiversity and human well-being mainly due to pollution and habitat destruction. Chilean companies finance most of the projects, but international companies finance over half of the energy and mining projects. Moreover, 37 % of the projects were located within HCVAs either for the establishment of future protected areas or where protected areas are currently established. As countries make new efforts to maintain and recover biodiversity, it is contradictory not to consider the threats posed by conflict-generating projects to key areas for conservation, both in public policies and in spatial planning instruments."
938,"Analyzing the linkage between military spending, economic growth, and ecological footprint in Pakistan: evidence from cointegration and bootstrap causality","Ahmed, Zahoor; Zafar, Muhammad Wasif; Mansoor, Sadia","The ecological consequences of military spending is a hugely neglected area, and a veil of mystery surrounds this topic. The environmental threats posed by militaries remain insufficiently investigated in the name of national security. Prompted by the internal and external conflicts and prolonged military dictatorships, the Pakistani military assumes a role that goes beyond that of a traditional army. The current study addresses this significant gap in the literature by investigating the impacts of military spending on economic growth and the ecological footprint in Pakistan from 1971 to 2016 using the combined cointegration test and the bootstrap causality test. The findings of the study unveil a positive impact of military spending on the ecological footprint, while a negative impact on economic growth. The outcomes of the bootstrap causality test of Hacker and Hatemi-J (2012) highlight that economic growth Granger causes military spending, while causality runs from military spending to the ecological footprint. Energy consumption contributes to the ecological footprint and economic growth, whereas education expenditures do not influence economic growth and the environment in the long run. Further, the findings suggest a U-shaped link between GDP and footprint in Pakistan. The authorities should focus on resolving external and internal conflicts, on a priority basis, and reduce military spending to improve economic growth and the environment."

Mostly, pollutants like CO2 and SO2 emissions are considered as the environmental indicators. However, for this study, we have selected ecological footprint as the indicator of environmental quality. The new econometric approach Dynamic Common Correlated Effects (DCCE) by Chudik and Pesaran (2015) has been used to measure the cross-sectional dependence among cross-sectional units. Results confirm that previous techniques for long panel data, like MG and PMG, give ambiguous outcomes in the presence of cross-sectional dependence. According to DCCE estimation, trade openness, FDI, and urbanization have a positive and significant relationship with ecological footprint while a significant and negative association is found between institutional performance and ecological footprint. The OIC countries must encourage green technology, clean production, and improved institutions for sustainable development and better environmental quality."

Panel quantile regression has been used for tickling distributional and unobserved individual heterogeneity. The findings indicate that our variables in the model on each others are heterogeneous across quantiles. More specifically, the effect of renewable energy consumption on carbon emission is negative while financial development has increasing influence on carbon emission. Carbon emission decreases the use of renewable energy while financial development positively affects renewable energy consumption. The increasing effect of carbon emission and renewable energy consumption on financial development has also been found. Finally, the current study findings give important recommendations to policy makers. (C) 2020 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd."

In birds, the 'open' and dynamic structure of foraging groups may prevent the emergence of structured hierarchies, although this assumption have hardly been tested. We report on agonistic data for ravens Corvus corax, collected over two 18-month periods for 183 marked individuals of a wild (fluid) population and 51 birds from six captive (stable) groups. We show that the dominance structure (steep and transitive) in wild foraging groups is strikingly similar to that found in captivity. In the wild, we found that higher ranks are mainly occupied by males, older and more aggressive individuals that also tend to receive fewer aggressions. Exploring the mechanisms sustaining the wild dominance structure, we confirmed that males are more aggressive than females and, with age, tend to receive fewer aggressions than females. Males that are about to leave the foraging groups for some months are less aggressive than newcomers or locals, while newcomers are specifically targeted by aggressions in their first year (as juveniles). Taken together, our results indicate that the socially dynamic conditions ravens face during foraging do not hinder, but provide opportunities for, using (advanced) social cognition. This article is part of the theme issue 'The centennial of the pecking order: current state and future prospects for the study of dominance hierarchies'."

943,Robust bidding strategy for demand response aggregators in electricity market based on game theory,"Abapour, Saeed; Mohammadi-Ivatloo, Behnam; Hagh, Mehrdad Tarafdar","One of the ways to manage and provide flexibility in power systems is demand response (DR). A large number of end-users as DR sources must be aggregated by an intermediate entity called DR aggregator. This paper proposes an approach based on game theory to obtain the best bidding strategy of DR aggregators in electricity market. In the presented scheme, an economic responsive load model is employed for DR approach which is based on customer benefit function and price elasticity. In this paper, the network operator receives DR services from the DR aggregator. It is considered that all bids from aggregators are assembled by a network operator which calculates the share of each aggregator in DR programs by revenue function optimization. Furthermore, the network operator offers rewards to DR aggregators to achieve this purpose. The robust optimization (RO) method is used handling price uncertainty. It is used to optimize the robustness of the decision-making strategies. A non-cooperative game is used to model the competition among DR aggregators. The Nash equilibrium idea is employed to solve this game. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."
944,Measuring regional transport sustainability using super-efficiency SBM-DEA with weighting preference,"Tian, Na; Tang, Shusong; Che, Ada; Wu, Peng","The development of transportation sector promotes China's rapid economic growth, but also brings a negative impact to China's society and environment such as pollution and energy waste. However, limited attention has been paid to China's transportation system, especially in terms of transport sustainability evaluation at a regional level. In this study, we first propose a new indicator system that involves systematic, economic, social and environmental indicators for measuring regional transport sustainability. Then, we propose an improved super-efficiency slacks-based measure DEA (SBM-DEA) model with weighting preference to evaluate the regional transport sustainability efficiency. An empirical application to measuring transport sustainability in Shaanxi province, China, during the period of 2000-2015 is presented to show the effectiveness of the proposed model. The empirical results show that Shaanxi's transport sustainability over half of the years is inefficient and its main reason is that the efficiency of environmental and social dimensions is low. Compared the result with that obtained by the SBM-DEA model without weighting preference, the number of effective decision-making units is reduced by the proposed DEA model. Computational results show that the evaluation result is generally in line with the reality. (c) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."

The study also aimed to see whether a device to measure manual dexterity (Imperial College Surgical Assessment Device, ICSAD), a global rating scale and an end product assessment tool could be used to objectively measure performance. Thirty surgeons were recruited to take part and were evenly split into novice, intermediate, and expert groups. The novice group took part in a one-week microsurgical course. The assessment of performance was done with the surgeon anastomosing a harvested rat aorta. They were assessed using ICSAD, which records number of hand movements, distance moved by hands and time. The assessment was also video recorded and later watched by two assessors. The procedure performance was scored using a global rating scale and the final anastomosis was scored using an end product assessment tool. The novice surgeons took the assessment at the beginning and at the end of the course. The intermediate and expert group performed the assessment once to use as a comparison to the novice group. By the end of the course the novices performed significantly better in all parameters in comparison to their pre course assessment. The novice group performed similarly to the expert group in their end of course assessment in four out of the five assessment parameters. Simulation using objective measures of performance can be used to effectively to train a group of novice microsurgeons."
946,Long-term (1870-2018) drought reconstruction in context of surface water security in India,"Mishra, Vimal","Droughts in India affect food production, gross domestic product (GDP), livelihood, and socio-economic condition of a large population associated with agriculture. Recent drought (2015-2018) caused groundwater depletion and affected about one-fourth of the Indian population. However, it remains unclear if the drought of 2015-2018 was among the most severe droughts that occurred in India. Here we use a long-term (1870-2018) data to identify the top five (""deadly"") meteorological/hydrological droughts based on overall severity score in the last century and half period. Out of a total of 18 meteorological droughts, the deadly droughts occurred in 1899, 1876, 2000, 1918, and 1965. Similarly, the deadly hydrological droughts occurred in 1899, 2000, 1876, 1965, and 1918 during 1870-2018. All the five deadly droughts were associated with the positive phase of El Nino Southern Oscillations (ENSO). Results show that the relationship between ENSO and monsoon (June to September) precipitation in India has weakened while the role of Indian and Atlantic Oceans have strengthened during the recent decades. Notwithstanding the longest (41 months) duration, the 2015-2018 drought did not feature among the deadly droughts. The 2015-2018 drought affected surface (reservoir storage) and groundwater availability in both southern and northern parts of India and was linked to El-Nino and Indian Ocean Dipole. Droughts and rapidly declining groundwater together can pose serious challenges to water security in India."
947,"Computational analysis of SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 surveillance by wastewater-based epidemiology locally and globally: Feasibility, economy, opportunities and challenges","Hart, Olga E.; Halden, Rolf U.","With the economic and practical limits of medical screening for SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 coming sharply into focus worldwide, scientists are turning now to wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) as a potential tool for assessing and managing the pandemic. We employed computational analysis and modeling to examine the feasibility, economy, opportunities and challenges of enumerating active coronavirus infections locally and globally using WBE. Depending on local conditions, detection in community wastewater of one symptomatic/asymptomatic infected case per 100 to 2,000,000 non-infected people is theoretically feasible, with some practical successes now being reported from around the world. Computer simulations for past, present and emerging epidemic hotspots (e.g., Wuhan, Milan, Madrid, New York City, Teheran, Seattle, Detroit and New Orleans) identified temperature, average in-sewer travel time and per-capita water use as key variables. WBE surveillance of populations is shown to be orders of magnitude cheaper and faster than clinical screening, yet cannot fully replace it. Cost savings worldwide for one-time national surveillance campaigns are estimated to be in the million to billion US dollar range (US$), depending on a nation's population size and number of testing rounds conducted. For resource poor regions and nations, WBE may represent the only viable means of effective surveillance. Important limitations of WBE rest with its inability to identify individuals and to pinpoint their specific locations. Not compensating for temperature effects renders WBE data vulnerable to severe under-/over-estimation of infected cases. Effective surveillance may be envisioned as a two-step process in which WBE serves to identify and enumerate infected cases, where after clinical testing then serves to identify infected individuals in WBE-revealed hotspots. Data provided here demonstrate this approach to save money, be broadly applicable worldwide, and potentially aid in precision management of the pandemic, thereby helping to accelerate the global economic recovery that billions of people rely upon for their livelihoods.

948,"Assessment and sources of heavy metals in suspended particulate matter in a tropical catchment, northeast Thailand","Zeng, Jie; Han, Guilin; Yang, Kunhua","Since the suspended particulate matter (SPM) is a vital heavy metal transporter of the river systems, assessment of heavy metals contamination in SPM is significant as the first step of the high-efficiency surface water environment management and further foundation of water resources sustainability. However, this assessment is rare in developing countries (e.g., Thailand, agriculture is the main economic pillar). Fluvial heavy metal pollution prevention strategy is urgently required in these areas for reducing human exposure to metal contamination. For this purpose, the assessment of eight selected heavy metals of 52 SPM samples in a Thailand tropical river (Mun River) was conducted. The findings suggest that the contents of heavy metals in SPM are Mn (4616.7 mg kg(-1)) > Zn (223.9 mg kg(-1)) > V (109.1 mg kg(-1)) > Cr (100.1 mg kg(-1)) > Ni (51.0 mg kg(-1)) > Cu (27.6 mg kg(-1)) > Pb (14.3 mg kg(-1)) > Cd (10.7 mg kg(-1)). A relatively large proportion of heavy metals (e.g., Mn, 89.5%; Zn, 54.2%) are transported in suspended loads in Mun River. Heavy metals accumulation assessment suggests that Cd (EF = 17.5, I-geo = 3.7) and Mn (EF = 14.3, I-geo = 2.1) are extremely enriched in SPM, while the other metals are slightly enriched or not enriched. Principal component (PC) analysis extracted three PCs. PC 1 with a high loading of Mn, Zn, Cd, Pb reflecting these metals mainly from anthropogenic emissions, PC 2 (V and Cu) is primarily characterized by the natural sources (e.g., rock weathering), while PC 3 (Cr and Ni) can be defined as the result of combined action of natural and anthropogenic inputs. Risk assessment denotes that Cd is the major toxicity of SPM with a high toxic risk index (TRICd = 9.4, 54% of the total TRI) and the V, Cr, Mn, and Cd in SPM are the major exposure health risk, particularly for children (hazard index, HI > 0.1), more focus is required for these metals. In total, this study provides powerful support for the prevention of heavy metal pollution and the sustainability of water resources in the Mun River in such a developing country (Thailand)."
949,"The response and simulation of ecosystem services value to land use/land cover in an oasis, Northwest China","Tan, Zhe; Guan, Qingyu; Lin, Jinkuo; Yang, Liqin; Luo, Haiping; Ma, Yunrui; Tian, Jing; Wang, Qingzheng; Wang, Ning","The oasis ecosystem is integral to the socio-economic stability and development in arid areas. This study illuminates the relationship between land use/land cover (LULC) and ecosystem services value (ESV) in Zhangye oasis from 1980 to 2015 and predicts changes in ESV in 2030. The coefficients for assessing ESV and the future land use simulation (FLUS) model for LULC simulation were modified by introducing natural geography and socio-economic data. The study found that the patterns of LULC and ESV in Zhangye oasis changed dramatically in 2000. Forest, grassland, and wetland were severely damaged due to the weak awareness of environmental protection, resulting in a significant decline in the ESV before 2000. Thanks to a number of ecological projects that have been put into practice and the improvement in climate conditions since 2000, the ESV has started to recover. The FLUS model reasonably predicted the LULC in 2015, and the kappa coefficient was 0.8991 after comparing with the actual LULC in 2015. On this basis, the land use scenario in 2030 is predicted, and the value of ecosystem services is estimated. The results show that the value of ecosystem services will continue to increase. This study can guide future land-use planning and raise public awareness of the need for ecosystem protection."
950,Application of simultaneous thermoelectric cooling and heating to improve the performance of a solar still: An experimental study and exergy analysis,"Shoeibi, Shahin; Rahbar, Nader; Esfahlani, Ahad Abedini; Kargarsharifabad, Hadi","The performance of solar stills is affected by various parameters (e.g. solar radiation, water depth, thermal insulation, and the temperature difference between glass and water). There are two alternatives to increase the temperature difference between glass and water: increasing the water or reducing the glass temperatures. The present study aims to investigate the effect of simultaneous thermoelectric cooling and heating on the performance of a solar still. The experiments were conducted during 8 days in Tehran, Iran (35 degrees 41'N, 51 degrees 19'E). The setup consisted of a double-slope solar still and a thermoelectric enhancing system that was used to cool the glass cover and heat the water, simultaneously. The cold side of the thermoelectric modules cools a water stream which passes on the glass cover. On the other side (hot side) of the thermoelectric modules, there flows another water stream passing through a helical coil heat exchanger which is located inside the solar still in the water. The obtained results, compared to the passive solar still, indicated that this modification improves the productivity by 2.32 times and generates 76.4% of the efficiency. Moreover, it is observed that the maximum exergy efficiency in the conventional and modified solar stills is about 1.48% and 0.8%, respectively. Also, the economic analysis showed that the price of the produced water for active and passive solar stills were about 0.105 and 0.176 $/L/m(2) respectively."

While genetic and medical aspects have been studied for several decades, rehabilitation intervention research is still in its infancy. In this study, the investigating researchers have presented a rehabilitative framework by using music therapy for girls with RTT. This model is founded upon the use of music therapy in light of Stern's proposal of subjective experience and affect attunement; it also refers to Rosenbaum's family-centered rehabilitation medicine perspective. This study both describes the theory behind this intervention and presents a newly developed outcome measure. This novel tool may have future clinical and research applications. Music therapy for patients with RTT has not been well researched yet, and, as a result, is not universally recommended. However this study's findings suggest that music therapy is an important component of multidisciplinary therapy. Further collaborative research should be encouraged in order to study and implement the use of music therapy in the treatment of severe disabilities. Projects such as the Enablin+ program with the support from the European Commission constitute fundamental tools in promoting integrative medical research and international networks."

953,Does the development of renewable energy promote carbon reduction? Evidence from Chinese provinces,"Yu, Shiwei; Hu, Xing; Li, Longxi; Chen, Hao","Developing renewable energy is a crucial measure in addressing climate change and achieving carbon reduction. However, research evidence on its impact is mixed. To fill this gap, we construct a panel quantile regression model in this study to examine whether China's renewable energy development has effectively promoted a reduction in carbon emissions using panel data of 30 Chinese provinces from 2005 to 2016. The results show that: (1) Improving China's renewable energy development level is conducive to carbon emission reductions. Specifically, carbon intensity could drop by 0.084%-0.149% for every 1% increase in renewable energy generation. However, the inhibitory effect is limited due to trapped electricity as well as the fact that substituting renewable energy for fossil energy has not yet sufficiently transformed the energy consumption structure. (2) Renewable energy development has a greater impact on carbon intensity reduction in regions with high or low carbon intensity than in areas with intermediate carbon intensity. (3) The main factor in the decline in carbon intensity in China is a decrease in energy intensity. Nonetheless, the role of renewable energy in carbon reduction has increased over time."
954,Microgrids: Overview and guidelines for practical implementations and operation,"Cagnano, A.; De Tuglie, E.; Mancarella, P.","A microgrid is a small portion of a power distribution system with distributed generators along with energy storage devices and controllable loads which can give rise to a self-sufficient energy system. From the utility grid side, a microgrid is seen as an equivalent generator that is able to seamlessly disconnect and operate autonomously once a fault affects the main grid. The design, installation and operation of such systems lead to dealing with a number of technical and operational challenges including control, protection and infrastructure requirements. To help designers and researchers address these challenges and draw potential recommendations for practical microgrid implementations, in this paper a review of the main design features of existing microgrids is undertaken, also in light of the experience gained during the realization of the Prince Lab microgrid at Polytechnic University of Bari, Italy. The main control functions required to guarantee an economic, reliable and secure operation of a microgrid are also reviewed. Finally, key practical guidelines for monitoring, operation and implementation of microgrids are provided."

The key component β-1,3-glucan (paramylon) constitutes 50% of E. gracilis. Mice were orally administered Euglena powder (250 and 500 mg/kg body weight (B.W.)) or β-glucan powder (250 mg/kg B.W.) for 19 days. In a preliminary immunology experiment, ICR mice were intraperitoneally injected with 80 mg of CCP/kg B.W. during the final 3 consecutive days. In the main experiment, BALB/c mice were treated with CCP for the final 5 days. To evaluate the enhancing effects of Euglena on the immune system, mouse B.W., the spleen index, natural killer (NK) cell activity and mRNA expression in splenocytes lungs and livers were determined. To detect cytokine and receptor expression, splenocytes were treated with 5 μg/ml concanavalin A or 1 μg/ml lipopolysaccharide. The B.W. and spleen index were significantly increased and NK cell activity was slightly enhanced in all the experimental groups compared to the CCP group. In splenocytes, the gene expression levels of tumor necrosis factor-α, interferon-γ, interleukin (IL)-10, IL-6, and IL-12 receptor were increased in the E. gracilis and β-glucan groups compared to the CCP group, but there was no significant difference. Treatment with 500mg of Euglena/kg B.W. significantly upregulated dectin-1 mRNA expression in the lung and liver compared to the CCP group. These results suggest that Euglena may enhance the immune system by strengthening innate immunity through immunosuppression."
956,Does the interaction between growth determinants a drive for global environmental sustainability? Evidence from world top 10 pollutant emissions countries,"Eluwole, Kayode Kolawole; Saint Akadiri, Seyi; Alola, Andrew Adewale; Etokakpan, Mfonobong Udom","Economic interdependence through foreign direct investment and trade of energy resources in a globalized world filled with mixed heritage sites stimulates economic activities thereby serving as a great catalyst for economic growth. However, the importance of these economies' interdependence transcends economic and sodo-cultural-political benefits to coastal protection, carbon sequestration, flood prevention and soil stabilization among others. To this end, this study seeks to examine whether the interdependence and interaction among foreign direct investment, energy consumption, real income is a drive for global environmental sustainability targets or not. In order to achieve our research objective, we make use of a panel-based study of world's top 10 pollutant emissions that comprises 37 developed countries of the world, using the Dynamic Autoregressive Distributed Lag techniques of Pooled Mean Group, Mean Group and Dynamic Fixed Effects estimators over the periods of 1995-2014 that incorporate tourism as an additional variable. Panel cointegration result shows that increase in the explanatory variables contributes to environmental degradation in the long-run. A 1% increase in kg oil equivalent of energy consumed led to 0.918% increase in environmental degradation, while a 1% increase real income and foreign direct investment decrease environmental degradation by 0.635% and 0.064%, with tourism insignificant impact in the long-run. Consequently, economic and environmental sustainability measures that would help to promote a cleaner and healthy environment globally for both the immediate and future generation were suggested.

957,Stability of nanofluid: A review,"Chakraborty, Samarshi; Panigrahi, Pradipta Kumar","Nanofluid is a suspension of nanoparticles (at least one dimension less than 100 nm) in a basefluid having superior thermal, rheological and wettability properties, which improves the performance of several applications i.e. heat transfer, lubrication, drug delivery and enhanced oil recovery etc. However, the critical bottleneck for widespread use of nanofluid is its stability. The instability of nanofluid leads to reduction in system performance with passage of time. Addressing the long term stability of nanofluid and its reusability are essential requirements for successful industrial use. This article focuses on different aspects of nanofluid stability starting from the preparation stage till implementation in practical applications. Specific attention has been given on nanofluid stability as a function of operating conditions i.e. high temperature, pressure, confinement, composition, salinity, external magnetic field and shear rate etc. in several applications i.e. heat transfer, microfluidics, lubrication, enhanced oil recovery and drag reduction etc. It is expected that the present review will provide guidance and contribute towards wider adoption of nanofluid in practical applications. Future research on stability issues related to techno-economic performance, hybrid nanofluid, quantum dot, hybrid stabilization technique, wall effect in microfluidics and porous media will further enhance the usability of nanofluid in widespread practical systems."

Japan is considered as one of the largest energy consumers and energy importers throughout the world which almost 96% of its primary energy supply in national level relies on the imports from other countries. After experiencing several harsh energy supply conditions over the last 40 years, Japan realized the sensitivity of its energy supply and decided to fundamentally restructure its energy supply and rely more on energy mix diversification, renewable energies, energy efficiency improvement, and carbon emissions reduction. In this article the energy security improvement and the government actions to boost diversification of energy by focusing more on renewable energies and reducing energy intensity, increasing energy efficiency and decreasing energy import dependency in Japan is studied. In addition, various renewable energy technologies as a substitute source of energy and promising ways of domestic energy supply as well as the factors to improve the security of energy supply are studied thoroughly. Moreover, it was realized that the most primary energy sources in Japan are biofuel and waste energy followed by hydropower and geothermal energy respectively. (C) 2020 The Authors.

However, few studies have investigated the associations between blood pressure and the accelerated aging. Methods and Results A cross-sectional study was conducted in 288 adults aged ≥50 years. We assessed the DNA methylation-based measures of biological age using CpG sites on the Illumina HumanMethylationEPIC BeadChip. Epigenetic age acceleration metrics were derived by regressing residuals (ΔAge) and ratios (aging rate) of DNA methylation age on chronological age. Dose-response relationships between blood pressure and epigenetic age acceleration were quantified using multiple linear regression and restricted cubic regression models. We found that each 10-mm Hg increase in systolic blood pressure was associated with 0.608 (95% CI, 0.231-0.984) years increase in ΔAge and 0.007 (95% CI, 0.002-0.012) increase in aging rate; meanwhile, for pulse pressure, the increase was 1.12 (95% CI, 0.625-1.61) years for ΔAge and 0.013 (95% CI, 0.007-0.020) for aging rate. Subgroup analysis showed that the significant associations of systolic blood pressure and pulse pressure with epigenetic age acceleration appeared to be limited to women, although interactions between blood pressure and sex were not significant (P values for interaction >0.05). The combination of women and hypertension was associated with a much higher increase in ΔAge (β [95% CI], 4.05 [1.07-7.02]) and aging rate (β [95% CI], 0.047 [0.008-0.087]), compared with male participants without hypertension. Conclusions Our findings suggested that high systolic blood pressure and pulse pressure were associated with the epigenetic age acceleration, providing important clues for relationships between blood pressure and epigenetic aging."

It is obvious that the integrated system could improve energy efficiency and reduce costs. However, the system scheduling is a problem that would determine the operation cost. In this paper, a hybrid energy system including wind power, photovoltaics, gas turbines, and energy storage was introduced. In order to obtain the minimum operation cost, an operation optimization model was built. The schedule plan of each unit was optimized by moth flame optimization algorithm. Finally, through empirical research on a microgrid project, the optimization results in three configuration case of wind power, photovoltaics, and storage indicated that the operation optimization model in this paper could effectively reduce system operation cost, and the optimal output plan of each unit was obtained. And it is proved that the model proposed in this paper has a certain guiding role on economically dispatch of hybrid energy system."

Therefore, this study re-examines the effect of renewable energy consumption on economic growth across 38 renewable-energy-consuming countries from 1990 to 2018. The dynamic ordinary least squares (DOLS), fully modified ordinary least squares (FMOLS) and heterogeneous non-causality approaches are applied. The empirical analysis confirms the presence of a long-run relationship between renewable energy consumption and economic growth. Further, we noted that renewable energy, non-renewable energy, capital and labor have positive impact on economic growth, particularly, renewable energy consumption has a positive impact on economic growth for 58% of the sample countries. The empirical results suggest that international cooperation agencies, energy organizers, governments, and associated bodies must act together in increasing renewable energy investment for low carbon growth in most of these economies.

962,Optimized sizing of a standalone PV-wind-hydropower station with pumped-storage installation hybrid energy system,"Xu, Xiao; Hu, Weihao; Cao, Di; Huang, Qi; Chen, Cong; Chen, Zhe","The development and utilization of renewable energy sources can not only effectively reduce carbon dioxide emissions, but also provide access to electricity to more parts of the world. A standalone hybrid system based on renewable sources is a promising way to supply reliable and continuous power in remote areas to which the grid has not extended. This paper designs and investigates a photovoltaics (PV)-wind-hydropower station with pumped-storage installation (HSPSI) hybrid energy system in Xiaojin, Sichuan, China as case of study. HSPSI can use the available flow of the river and store surplus energy generated from wind and PV by pumping water from the lower reservoir to the upper one. From the perspective of the investors, the techno-economic index is usually used to design the PV-wind-HSPSI hybrid energy system which aims to find the optimal configure with maximum power supply reliability and minimum investment cost. The trade-off analysis between the two objectives is based on Pareto optimality theory by means of Multi-Objective Particle Swarm Optimization (MOPSO). Besides, this paper takes the curtailment rate (CR) of the wind and PV power into consideration due to policy requirements. The relationship between the two objectives under various CR are analyzed and compared. Several results can be obtained as follows: 1) Comparing with the PV-HSPSI and wind-HSPSI hybrid energy system, the levelized cost of energy (LCOE) of the PV-wind-HSPSI hybrid energy system can reduce by 32.8% and 45.0% respectively. 2) For the PV-wind-HSPSI hybrid energy system, the LCOE can be as low as 0.091 $/kWh when 5% LPSP can be acceptable. 3) The policy of CR is unfavorable for the investors which leads to a higher investment cost. 4) Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) performs better than genetic algorithm (GA) and Simulated Annealing method (SA) with a least LCOE. 5) both MOPSO and weighted sum approach (WSA) have a good performance to find the Pareto fronts and its hypervolume indicator (HV) is calculated.

963,Fiscal policy and CO2 emissions from heterogeneous fuel sources in Thailand: Evidence from multiple structural breaks cointegration test,"Ike, George N.; Usman, Ojonugwa; Sarkodie, Samuel Asumadu","This study investigated the dynamic linkage between fiscal policy, energy and CO2 emissions from heterogeneous fossil fuel sources in the context of the environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) framework for Thailand. With annual data from 1972 to 2014 while incorporating structural breaks, the study employed a Maki cointegration test and the dynamic ordinary least squares estimation approach. The results found that a 1% increase in fiscal policy brought about a 6.5% (p < 0.05) increase in the low CO2 emitting gaseous fuel sources (natural gas), a 0.2% (p < 0.01) reduction in the intermediate CO2 emitting liquid fuel sources (crude oil derivatives), and an insignificant increase 0.2% (p > 0.05) in the high CO2 emitting solid fuel sources (coal derivatives). While a 1% increase in fiscal policy abates aggregated CO2 emissions by 0.2% (p < 0.05), the existence of the EKC hypothesis was validated in all models. The causality test revealed a bi-directional causal relationship between fiscal policy and CO2 emissions and unidirectional flow from fiscal policy to energy consumption. This confirms that fiscal policy initiatives towards energy consumption have long-run implications for environmental quality. Our findings support the energy-led growth hypothesis for the Thai economy. The implication of the finding is that increasing the share of clean and renewable energy sources should be encouraged-rather than energy conservation policies, which obstruct energy supply and utilization. This highlights a more efficient way of harnessing energy sources through the instrumentality of fiscal policy. (C) 2019 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V."
964,"Health insurance, medical debt, and financial well-being","Michael Batty,Christa Gibbs,Benedic Ippolito,Michael Batty,Christa Gibbs,Benedic Ippolito","We study the financial protection provided by health insurance through two natural experiments-the Affordable Care Act's under 26 provision and Medicare eligibility. In both cases, the coverage expansion sharply reduces medical debt in collections for consumers within the affected ages but does not systematically improve credit outcomes not directly related to medical care. This is consistent with the infrequent repayment rate and lack of persistence on credit reports that we document for medical collections, which mute a key channel through which reductions in medical collections could directly affect the other financial outcomes studied here. These results help clarify the role of health insurance in broader financial health and suggest that, at least among the populations studied here, medical debts in collection may often be a symptom rather than a cause of wider financial distress as measured on credit reports."

Physical and information flows in energy systems are increasingly complex and distributed, leaving centralized structures inefficient. Blockchain technology is suggested as part of the next step in this transition. Blockchain has potential to facilitate distributed, peer-to-peer trading with reduced transaction costs, increased security via cryptography, and prosumer choice. However, there are as of yet multiple challenges to the expansion of blockchain in the energy sector. This paper argues that analysis of these challenges requires a multi-angled approach incorporating technological, economic, social, environmental, and institutional dimensions. First, each dimension is explored, substantiated based on a blockchain-based energy system case in Japan. Concrete challenges of scaling this case toward 2050 and potential opportunities in overcoming these challenges are discussed, leveraging extensive literature review. Finally, an overview of strategic indications is suggested. The findings of this paper present initial indications on challenges and opportunities to overcome them based on a multi-dimensional overview. It is suggested that the factors identified across the dimensions are interrelated. This would in turn call for coherent innovation management and multi-stakeholder innovation ecosystems. Living Labs and regulatory sandboxes are prospective foundations to support such ecosystems, and enable informed decision-making among both private and public sector actors. At large, it is suggested that a holistic and pragmatic approach can benefit the application and scalability of blockchain in the energy transition."
966,Emergency preparedness during the COVID-19 pandemic: Modelling the roles of social media with fuzzy DEMATEL and analytic network process,"Egberto Selerio Jr,June Anne Caladcad,Mary Rose Catamco,Esehl May Capinpin,Lanndon Ocampo,Egberto Selerio Jr,June Anne Caladcad,Mary Rose Catamco,Esehl May Capinpin,Lanndon Ocampo","While the utility of social media has been widely recognized in the current literature, minimal effort has been made to further the analysis of their roles on disruptive events, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. To address this gap, this work comprehensively identifies the 16 prevalent social media roles in disaster preparedness during the COVID-19 pandemic. Furthermore, an integrated fuzzy decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (FDEMATEL) and analytic network process (ANP), hereby termed the FDANP methodology, is used to perform the causal analysis of social media roles and to systemically measure the priority of these roles in emergency preparedness. Among the identified roles, those considered top priority are social media roles concerned with the facilitation of public health policy development, prevention of misinformation, and management of public behavior and response. These results were found to be robust, as evidenced by the sensitivity analysis. The implications of these findings were also detailed in this work in the context of a developing country."
967,Repulsion-Based p-Dispersion with Distance Constraints in Non-Convex Polygons,"Zhengguan Dai,Kathleen Xu,Melkior Ornik,Zhengguan Dai,Kathleen Xu,Melkior Ornik","Motivated by the question of optimal facility placement, the classical p-dispersion problem seeks to place a fixed number of equally sized non-overlapping circles of maximal possible radius into a subset of the plane. While exact solutions to this problem may be found for placement into particular sets, the problem is provably NP-complete for general sets, and existing work is largely restricted to geometrically simple sets. This paper makes two contributions to the theory of p-dispersion. First, we propose a computationally feasible suboptimal approach to the p-dispersion problem for all non-convex polygons. The proposed method, motivated by the mechanics of the p-body problem, considers circle centers as continuously moving objects in the plane and assigns repulsive forces between different circles, as well as circles and polygon boundaries, with magnitudes inversely proportional to the corresponding distances. Additionally, following the motivating application of optimal facility placement, we consider existence of additional hard upper or lower distance bounds on pairs of circle centers, and adapt the proposed method to provide a p-dispersion solution that provably respects such constraints. We validate our proposed method by comparing it with previous exact and approximate methods for p-dispersion. The method quickly produces near-optimal results for a number of containers."
968,An MCDM-based social network analysis of water governance to determine actors' power in water-food-energy nexus,"Kharanagh, Samaneh Ghafoori; Banihabib, Mohammad Ebrahim; Javadi, Saman","A major water governance concern is how to coordinate the complex relationships of the water, food, and energy sectors and the resulting economic, social, and environmental consequences. Focusing on the challenges in one sector (e.g. water shortage in the water sector) and making decisions without considering other sectors will not solve these problems; rather, it will create a new problem (the decline of food production) in the food sectors. The nexus approach is a novel method to represent the interrelated challenges of the water, food, and energy sectors by considering the sectors' policies to achieve sustainable development. The present study analyzes the social network of nexus actors in the Yazd-Ardakan aquifer, Yazd province, Iran. For this purpose, 54 partners in the nexus network were first identified in various public, private, semi-private and non-governmental organizations. Three types of interactions (knowledge and information exchange, budget transfer, and collaboration) were analyzed among the actors. The actor-network was, then, assessed at the levels of the entire network and individual actors. Then, a coherence analysis was performed by the density index at the entire network level, and the power analysis was carried out using in-degree, out-degree, betweenness, closeness, and eigenvector centrality indices at the individual actor level. Social network analysis criteria were, then, incorporated with the multi-criteria decision-making model ELECTRE I to select the key and powerful actors in the nexus network. Next, the powerful actors were identified and introduced with respect to 15 criteria employed in the social network analysis. According to the results, the power structure in the nexus network of the research area is not at equilibrium. Most of the power lies with the public sector. The water, food, and energy sectors act alone and they do not exploit their maximum organizational capacities to establish relationships with one another."
969,The Advantages of Industry 4.0 Applications for Sustainability: Results from a Sample of Manufacturing Companies,"Brozzi, Riccardo; Forti, David; Rauch, Erwin; Matt, Dominik T.","Far from being exclusively related to economic considerations, the advantages of Industry 4.0 applications also include environmental and social concerns. An increasing amount of scientific publications relate the implementation of the fourth industrial revolution paradigm to sustainability. Several studies reported opportunities of Industry 4.0 implementation particularly to the environmental dimension of sustainability, e.g., through improved logistics streams and lowered waste from production. The present research aims at providing evidence on whether manufacturing companies consider Industry 4.0 implementation as an advantage contributing to environmental and social sustainability in terms of lower environmental impact of production, as well as higher physical relief for workers and flexibility of work organisation. The results were an attempt to study such relations with company sizes, industry sectors, turnover and self-assessed levels of digitalization varying. The sample encompasses 65 companies located in the Marche region (Italy). The results show that overall the perception of economic opportunities prevail, while the association of a beneficial impact of Industry 4.0 on environmental sustainability is rather low across companies, regardless of their size, turnover and digital level. As for the statistically significant variables, the results suggest a strong association of the size and the digital level to specific Industry 4.0 related advantages, referring to the social and economic dimension of sustainability, respectively."
970,Does the popularization of agricultural mechanization improve energy-environment performance in China's agricultural sector?,"Jiang, Minjie; Hu, Xinjie; Chunga, Joseph; Lin, Ziyi; Fei, Rilong","Environmental problems caused by the rapid popularization of agricultural mechanization and the increase of energy input in China's agricultural production have caused increasing concern. Based on the study sample of China's 30 provinces from 2000 to 2017, this paper estimates the energy-environment performance of agricultural sector using the global DEA method. Furthermore, it applied a panel TOBIT model based on censored data to empirically analyze the impact of popularization of mechanization on energy-environment performance in China's agricultural sector. The main findings are as follows: Firstly, the mean value of energy-environment performance is 0.1842, and the values of national and regional performance showed a downward trend in the sample period, indicating that most regions in China's agricultural sector did not perform well in terms of energy saving and pollution control. Secondly, the development of agricultural mechanization has a significant negative effect on energy-environment performance. This result confirms the fact that the regions with high penetration rates of agricultural mechanization usually have a low energy-environment performance. Finally, in regard to the control variables, energy price, reservoir infrastructure construction and agricultural industrial structure negatively affect energy-environment performance, while the agricultural labor force and agricultural mechanization service organizations have a positive effect on China's energy-environment performance.

971,Trend in Extreme Precipitation Indices Based on Long Term In Situ Precipitation Records over Pakistan,"Bhatti, Asher Samuel; Wang, Guojie; Ullah, Waheed; Ullah, Safi; Hagan, Daniel Fiifi Tawia; Nooni, Isaac Kwesi; Lou, Dan; Ullah, Irfan","Assessing the long-term precipitation changes is of utmost importance for understanding the impact of climate change. This study investigated the variability of extreme precipitation events over Pakistan on the basis of daily precipitation data from 51 weather stations from 1980-2016. The non-parametric Mann-Kendall, Sen's slope estimator, least squares method, and two-tailed simple t-test methods were used to assess the trend in eight precipitation extreme indices. These indices were wet days (R1 >= 1 mm), heavy precipitation days (R10 >= 10 mm), very heavy precipitation days (R20 >= 20 mm), severe precipitation (R50 >= 50 mm), very wet days (R95p) defining daily precipitation >= 95 percentile, extremely wet days (R99p) defining daily precipitation >= 99 percentile, annual total precipitation in wet days (PRCPTOT), and mean precipitation amount on wet days as simple daily intensity index (SDII). The study is unique in terms of using high stations' density, extended temporal coverage, advanced statistical techniques, and additional extreme indices. Furthermore, this study is the first of its kind to detect abrupt changes in the temporal trend of precipitation extremes over Pakistan. The results showed that the spatial distribution of trends in different precipitation extreme indices over the study region increased as a whole; however, the monsoon and westerlies humid regions experienced a decreasing trend of extreme precipitation indices during the study period. The results of the sequential Mann-Kendall (SqMK) test showed that all precipitation extremes exhibited abrupt dynamic changes in temporal trend during the study period; however, the most frequent mutation points with increasing tendency were observed during 2011 and onward. The results further illustrated that the linear trend of all extreme indices showed an increasing tendency from 1980- 2016. Similarly, for elevation, most of the precipitation extremes showed an inverse relationship, suggesting a decrease of precipitation along the latitudinal extent of the country. The spatiotemporal variations in precipitation extremes give a possible indication of the ongoing phenomena of climate change and variability that modified the precipitation regime of Pakistan. On the basis of the current findings, the study recommends that future studies focus on underlying physical and natural drivers of precipitation variability over the study region."

This material was characterized by magnetism measurements, zeta potential, scanning electron microscopy, nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms, and thermogravimetric analysis. The proposed analytical method is based on stir bar sorptive-dispersive microextraction (SBSDME) followed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. The main parameters involved in the extraction step were optimized by using the response surface methodology as a multivariate optimization method, whereas a univariate approach was employed to study the desorption parameters. Under the optimized conditions, the proposed method was properly validated showing good linearity (at least up to 50 ng mL-1) and enrichment factors (13-22), limits of detection and quantification in the low ng L-1 range (1.4-7.0 ng L-1), and good intra- and inter-day repeatability (relative standard deviations below 15%). Matrix effects were observed for the direct analysis of urine samples, but they were negligible when a 1:1 v/v dilution with deionized water was performed. Finally, the method was successfully applied to human urine samples from three volunteers, one of them consuming a prescribed drug for depression that tested positive for clomipramine and its main active metabolite. Quantitative relative recoveries (80-113%) were obtained by external calibration. The present work expands the applicability of the SBSDME to new analytes and new types of magnetic sorbents."

The power sector takes certain measures to abandon photovoltaic power generation, thus limiting the development of clean energy power generation. This study is to propose an accurate short-term photovoltaic power prediction method. A new short-term photovoltaic power output prediction model is proposed Based on extreme learning machine and intelligent optimizer. Firstly, the input of the model is determined by correlation coefficient method. Then the chicken swarm optimizer is improved to strengthen the convergence. Secondly, the improved chicken swarm optimizer is used to optimize the weights and the extreme learning machine thresholds to improve the prediction effect. Finally, the improved chicken swarm optimizer extreme learning machine model is used to predict the photovoltaic power under different weather conditions. The testing results show that the average mean absolute percentage error and root mean square error of improved chicken swarm optimizer - extreme learning machine model are 5.54% and 3.08%. The proposed method is of great significance for the economic dispatch of power systems and the development of clean energy. (c) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."

While the global pandemic has led to the enhancement of the health system and decline of emissions, economic development appears deteriorating. Here, we present the global environmental, health and economic dimension of the effect of COVID-19 using qualitative and empirical assessments. We report the health system policies, environmental sustainability issues, and fiscal, monetary and exchange rate measures introduced during lockdown across countries. While air pollution is reported to have declined, municipal and medical waste is increasing. The COVID-19 global pandemic uncertainty ranks the UK as the country with the highest uncertainty level among 143 countries. The USA has introduced 100% of pre-COVID-19 crisis level GDP, the highest policy cut-rate among 162 countries. Science, innovation, research and development underpin COVID-19 containment measures implemented across countries. Our study demonstrates the need for future research to focus on environment-health-economic nexus-a trilemma that has a potential trade-off."

On neuropathology, sporadic SVD is characterized by abnormalities to the small vessels of the brain predominantly in the form of cerebral amyloid angiopathy and arteriolosclerosis. These pathologies frequently coexist with Alzheimer disease changes, such as plaques and tangles, in a single brain. Conversely, during life, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) only captures the larger manifestations of SVD in the form of parenchymal brain abnormalities. There appears to be a major knowledge gap regarding the underlying neuropathology of individual MRI-detectable SVD abnormalities. Ex vivo MRI in postmortem human brain tissue is a powerful tool to bridge this gap. This review summarizes current insights into the histopathologic correlations of MRI manifestations of SVD, their underlying cause, presumed pathophysiology, and associated secondary tissue injury. Moreover, we discuss the advantages and limitations of ex vivo MRI-guided histopathologic investigations and make recommendations for future studies."
976,Effect of aluminum balls on the productivity of solar distillate,"Attia, Mohammed El Hadi; Driss, Zied; Manokar, A. Muthu; Sathyamurthy, Ravishankar","Drinking water has become a real global problem, despite the abundance of unsaturated saltwater and colorless, which do not meet the requirements of the World Health Organization. The El Oued, in the southeastern part of Algeria, contains vast quantities of salt water and non-potable water. Solar distillation can be used as a solution to resolve this trouble. To provide drinking water, we use free sunlight to treat salt water. The traditional solar distillation device, which is one mile long (0.5 x 0.5 m), is designed to confirm the effectiveness of this solution. The traditional single slope solar distillation, its dimensions (0.5 x 0.5 m), is designed to confirm the effectiveness of this solution. Solar distillation is an environmental, economic and simple technique, but it needs some modifications to increase the distilled water production. In this work, we added aluminum balls inside the solar distillate box. In this work, we added 42 aluminum balls with a diameter of 2 cm inside a solar distillates box; positioned as follows (6 balls x 7 balls). The results showed that aluminum balls increased the distillation of distilled water by about 27.16 %."
977,Valuation of air pollution externalities: comparative assessment of economic damage and emission reduction under COVID-19 lockdown,"Bherwani, Hemant; Nair, Moorthy; Musugu, Kavya; Gautam, Sneha; Gupta, Ankit; Kapley, Atya; Kumar, Rakesh","Air pollution (AP) is one of the major causes of health risks as it leads to widespread morbidity and mortality each year. Its environmental impacts include acid rains, reduced visibility, but more importantly and significantly, it affects human health. The price tag of not managing AP is seen in the rise of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), cardiovascular disease, and respiratory ailments like asthma and chronic bronchitis. But as the world battles the corona pandemic, COVID-19 lockdown has abruptly halted human activity, leading to a significant reduction in AP levels. The effect of this reduction is captured by reduced cases of morbidity and mortality associated with air pollution. The current study aims to monetarily quantify the decline in health impacts due to reduced AP levels under lockdown scenario, as against business as usual, for four cities-Delhi, London, Paris, and Wuhan. The exposure assessment with respect to pollutants like particulate matter (PM(2.5)and PM10), NO2, and SO(2)are evaluated. Value of statistical life (VSL), cost of illness (CoI), and per capita income (PCI) for disability-adjusted life years (DALY) are used to monetize the health impacts for the year 2019 and 2020, considering the respective period of COVID-19 lockdown of four cities. The preventive benefits related to reduced AP due to lockdown is evaluated in comparison to economic damage sustained by these four cities. This helps in understanding the magnitude of actual damage and brings out a more holistic picture of the damages related to lockdown."

Although it is relatively uncommon, it has a significant impact on the quality of life. It is a multifactorial disease that has risk factors ranging from seasonal changes, lifestyle habits to genetics. It occurs in 2 forms- Episodic and Chronic, each having its well-defined Diagnostic Criteria. Moreover, Cluster Headache has an exhaustive list of options for both Preventive and Abortive treatment. This article focuses on Cluster Headache, its pathophysiology, risk factors, differentials, and its diverse treatment modalities. In this study, an all-language literature search was conducted on Medline, Cochrane, Embase, and Google Scholar till October 2021. The following search strings and Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms were used: ""Cluster Headache,"" ""Triptans,"" ""Neuromodulation,"" and ""Migraine."" We explored the literature on Cluster Headache for its epidemiology, pathophysiology, the role of various genes and how they bring about the disease as well as its episodic and chronic variants, and treatment options. Although we have a wide variety of options for Preventive and Abortive therapy, newer more effective pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions are being developed, and must be integrated into new treatment protocols."

This technique can study white matter (WM) microstructure in neurodegenerative disorders, including Parkinson's disease (PD). Previous neuroimaging studies have suggested cerebellar involvement in the pathogenesis of PD, and these cerebellum alterations can correlate with PD symptoms and stages. Using the PRISMA 2020 framework, PubMed and EMBASE were searched to retrieve relevant articles. Our search revealed 472 articles. After screening titles and abstracts, and full-text review, and implementing the inclusion criteria, 68 papers were selected for synthesis. Reviewing the selected studies revealed that the patterns of reduction in cerebellum WM integrity, assessed by fractional anisotropy, mean diffusivity, radial diffusivity, and axial diffusivity measures can differ symptoms and stages of PD. Cerebellar diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) changes in PD patients with ""postural instability and gait difficulty"" are significantly different from ""tremor dominant"" PD patients. Freezing of the gate is strongly related to cerebellar involvement depicted by DTI. The ""reduced cognition,"" ""visual disturbances,"" ""sleep disorders,"" ""depression,"" and ""olfactory dysfunction"" are not related to cerebellum microstructural changes on DTI, while ""impulsive-compulsive behavior"" can be linked to cerebellar WM alteration. Finally, higher PD stages and longer disease duration are associated with cerebellum white matter alteration depicted by DTI. Depiction of cerebellar white matter involvement in PD is feasible by DTI. There is an association with disease duration and severity and several clinical presentations with DTI findings. This clinical-imaging association may eventually improve disease management."

Red blood cell count (RBCs), packed cell volume (PCV), hemoglobin concentration (Hb), thrombocytes, white blood cell count (WBCs), and WBC differentiation were investigated. A total of 450 unsexed Japanese quail were randomized into three groups (45/replicate; 3 replicates; 135/group). As a monitoring group, the first group was given untreated tap water to drink. The two others were consumed magnetized water that were subjected to an electrical magnetic field with a power of 1 Tesla (10,000 Gauss) and 2 Tesla (20,000 Gauss), respectively. The treatments had a significant (p ≤ 0.05) effect on thrombocytes and Hb. Sex showed significant (p ≤ 0.05) differences for RBCs and PCV at 42 days of age. At different ages, significant effects were observed on histomorphometric parameters of the Japanese quail intestinal tract. It may be inferred that the influence of magnetized water, up to 1 Tesla, was positive on the haematological and histomorphometric parameters of the Japanese quail intestinal tract by augmenting the haematological measurements, which were within a normal range and increasing the surface area of the villus."

The Cry1Ac toxin, despite having not being characterized as an adjuvant, has also proved to be immunogenic and able to activate macrophages. Here, we investigated the potential antitumor adjuvant effect conferred by the Cry1Ac protoxin and Cry1Ac toxin in a triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) murine model. First, we evaluated the ability of Cry1Ac proteins to improve dendritic cell (DC) activation and cellular response through intraperitoneal (i.p.) coadministration with the 4T1 cellular lysate. Mice coadministered with the Cry1Ac protoxin showed an increase in the number and activation of CD11c+MHCII- and CD11c+MHCII+low in the peritoneal cavity and an increase in DC activation (CD11c+MHCII+) in the spleen. Cry1Ac protoxin increased the proliferation of TCD4+ and TCD8+ lymphocytes in the spleen and mesenteric lymph nodes (MLN), while the Cry1Ac toxin only increased the proliferation of TCD4+ and TCD8+ in the MLN. Remarkably, when tested in the in vivo TNBC mouse model, prophylactic immunizations with 4T1 lysates plus the Cry1Ac protoxin protected mice from developing tumors. The antitumor effect conferred by the Cry1Ac protoxin also increased specific cytotoxic T cell responses, and prevented the typical tumor-related decrease of T cells (TCD3+ and TCD4+) as well the increase of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC) in spleen. Also in the tumor microenvironment of mice coadministered twice with Cry1Ac protoxin immunological improvements were found such as reductions in immunosupressive populations (T regulatory lymphocytes and MDSC) along with increases in macrophages upregulating CD86. These results show a differential antitumor adjuvant capability of Cry1Ac proteins, highlighting the ability of Cry1Ac protoxin to enhance local and systemic tumor immunity in TNBC. Finally, using a therapeutic approach, we evaluated the coadministration of Cry1Ac protoxin with doxorubicin. A significant reduction in tumor volume and lung metastasis was found, with increased intratumoral levels of tumor necrosis factor-α and IL-6 with respect to the vehicle group, further supporting its antitumor applicability."

The infection is transmitted to a person when an infected mosquito stings, injecting the saliva into the human body. The best possible way to prevent a mosquito-borne infection till date is to save the humans from exposure to mosquito bites. This study proposes a Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning based system to detect the presence of two critical disease spreading classes of mosquitoes such as the Aedes and Culex. The proposed system will effectively aid in epidemiology to design evidence-based policies and decisions by analyzing the risks and transmission. The study proposes an effective methodology for the classification of mosquitoes using ML and CNN models. The novel RIFS has been introduced which integrates two types of feature selection techniques - the ROI-based image filtering and the wrappers-based FFS technique. Comparative analysis of various ML and deep learning models has been performed to determine the most appropriate model applicable based on their performance metrics as well as computational needs. Results prove that ETC outperformed among the all applied ML model by providing 0.992 accuracy while VVG16 has outperformed other CNN models by giving 0.986 of accuracy."

S.","One of the strategies to reduce the environmental impacts associated with electricity is to employ renewable resources such as biomass or even waste. However, the evaluation of the sustainability of a power plant depends on the development of several analyses, which should encompass thermodynamic and environmental parameters. Energy, exergy, and exergoenvironmental assessments are carried out for a sugarcane bagasse cogeneration system, along with a Life Cycle Assessment for the Brazilian sugarcane bagasse, employing the Ecoindicator 99 method. The specific environmental impacts of electricity and steam are 6.023 mPt/MJ and 4.038 mPt/MJ, respectively, and the boiler feed pump and radiator presented the highest average environmental impact per exergy of fuel and product, respectively. The component with the highest exergoenvironmental factor was the furnace (60.32%), demonstrating margins for benefits in the formation of pollutants and destruction of exergy. Exergoenvironmental assessments can be utilized to support the adoption of more efficient (although more complex) cogeneration systems, especially in the aftermath of the COVID-19 crisis."
984,Uneven energy transitions: Understanding continued energy peripheralization in rural communities,"O'Sullivan, Kate; Golubchikov, Oleg; Mehmood, Abid","This paper problematizes the uneven nature of low carbon energy transitions in the context of uneven geographical development and core/periphery asymmetries. It explores the impacts of transition for peripheral communities lacking political power and agglomerative advantages. While decentralised developments that emerge with energy transition promise to bring new opportunities to remote areas, factors of economic and political inequalities render those opportunities socially and spatially segregated. Exploring experiences of rural and exurban communities in South Wales, the paper establishes links between low carbon transition and its actually existing implications on the ground. It demonstrates that even if having an abundance of natural resource and physical space to harness low carbon energy, many rural communities are trapped in the chronic positions of energy peripheralization."
985,Renewable energy and environmental quality: A second-generation panel evidence from the Sub Saharan Africa (SSA) countries,"Salahuddin, Mohammad; Habib, Md Anamul; Al-Mulali, Usama; Ozturk, Ilhan; Marshall, Morris; Ali, Md Idris","This study employs dynamic panel data for 34 Sub Saharan Africa (SSA) countries for the period 1984-2016 to estimate the effects of renewable energy on environmental quality measured by three indicators, namely, per capita CO2 emissions, energy intensity (EI) and Aggregate National Savings (ANS). The study leveraged a battery of second-generation econometric tests and estimation and causality methods to obtain the coefficients between the regressed and the regressors. Results reveal that use of renewable energy reduces CO2 emissions and energy intensity while it enhances ANS. Economic growth still seems to be expensive for the region as it stimulates CO2 emissions. However, it has a positive effect on ANS. As expected, fossil fuels exacerbate CO(2 )emissions and energy intensity. FDI is found to be detrimental for the environment of SSA region with its positive significant coefficient on CO2 emissions. Financial development is reported to reduce CO2 emissions. Some causal links between variables are also noted."

Considering the high cost of in-situ monitoring equipment and the sparse coverage of monitoring points, the Sentinel-1 images and Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) technique were used to conduct landslide monitoring and analysis. The Muyubao landslide in the Three Gorges Reservoir area in China was taken as a case study. A total of 37 images from March 2016 to September 2017 were collected, and the displacement time series were extracted using the Stanford Method for Persistent Scatterer (StaMPS) small baselines subset method. The comparison to global positioning system monitoring results indicated that the InSAR processing of the Muyubao landslide was accurate and reliable. Combined with the field investigation, the deformation evolution and its response to triggering factors were analyzed. During this monitoring period, the creeping process of the Muyubao landslide showed obvious spatiotemporal deformation differences. The changes in the reservoir water level were the trigger of the Muyubao landslide, and its deformation mainly occurred during the fluctuation period and high-water level period of the reservoir."
987,The relationship between innovation and sustainability: A meta-analytic study,"Kuzma, Edson; Padilha, Luccas Santin; Sehnem, Simone; Julkovski, Dulcimar Jose; Roman, Darlan Jose","The objective of this study is to analyze the effects of innovation on the performance of organizational sustainability, as well as on the environmental, economic and social dimensions. The search was done using various data collection sources, such as Scopus, WoS, Science Direct, Emerald, Sage, Wiley Online Library and Proquest. The research findings indicate that innovation positively impacts sustainability performance. The strongest and most favorable correlations occurred between economic innovation and sustainability performance and between environmental innovation and sustainability performance. Thus, the main contributions of the study are associated with: a) the existence of a positive and strong relationship between innovation and sustainability performance; b) evidence of innovation effect size on sustainability performance (combined effect size coefficient at r = 0.529 (p-value <0.000)); c) an identification of the gaps in the scientific literature evaluating the effect of innovation on the sustainability of organizations; and d) the fail-safe Rosenthal value is 37,800, which indicates that the number of unpublished documents required to make the observed effect size insignificant is too large. Future studies can advance with meta analyzes that adopt moderating and mediating constructions to assess the relationship between innovation and performance in sustainability. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

988,Strength and durability performance of geopolymer binder of ambient cured alkali-activated MSW rejected waste and GGBFS mixes,"Rashmi Shrivas,Bala Ramudu Paramkusam,Shyam Bihari Dwivedi,Rashmi Shrivas,Bala Ramudu Paramkusam,Shyam Bihari Dwivedi","Municipal solid waste (MSW) is being generated every day, and its safe disposal is one of the major environmental challenges nowadays. The main focus of this research is to examine the usability of the soil-like inorganic component of MSW, named MSW rejected waste, as a geopolymer binder. In this study, the effect of mutual replacement of MSW rejected waste with ground granulated blast furnace slag (GGBFS) at 10% interval on the synthesis of geopolymer binder with reference to density, alkali concentration, and curing period is studied by conducting compressive strength, permeability, and durability tests. The design of mixes follows, according to their pre-determined compaction parameters, optimum moisture content, and maximum dry density. The curing conditions were found to be significant in affecting the properties of the geopolymer. The effect of acid environment on strength properties of geopolymer mixes has also been studied. The unconfined compressive strength, pulse wave velocity, water absorption, and microstructural analysis have been performed on designed mixes to identify the optimized design of the mixtures. Results showed that the strength increased with the increment of GGBFS percentage and increment of concentration of sodium hydroxide (NaOH) up to 8 M."
989,Dual Role of Mo6 S8 in Polysulfide Conversion and Shuttle for Mg-S Batteries,"Liping Wang,Piotr Jankowski,Christian Njel,Werner Bauer,Zhenyou Li,Zhen Meng,Bosubabu Dasari,Tejs Vegge,Juan Maria García Lastra,Zhirong Zhao-Karger,Maximilian Fichtner,Liping Wang,Piotr Jankowski,Christian Njel,Werner Bauer,Zhenyou Li,Zhen Meng,Bosubabu Dasari,Tejs Vegge,Juan Maria García Lastra,Zhirong Zhao-Karger,Maximilian Fichtner","Magnesium-Sulfur batteries are one of most appealing options among the post-lithium battery systems due to its potentially high energy density, safe and sustainable electrode materials. The major practical challenges are originated from the soluble magnesium polysulfide intermediates and their shuttling between the electrodes, which cause high overpotentials, low sulfur utilization, and poor Coulombic efficiency. Herein, a functional Mo6 S8 modified separator is designed to effectively address these issues. Both the experimental results and density functional theory calculations show that the electrochemically active Mo6 S8 layer has a superior adsorption capability of polysulfides and simultaneously acts as a mediator to accelerate the polysulfide conversion kinetics. Remarkably, the magnesium-sulfur cell assembled with the functional separator delivers a high specific energy density (942.9 mA h g-1 in the 1st cycle) and can be cycled at 0.2 C for 200 cycles with a Coulombic efficiency of 96%. This work demonstrates a new design concept toward high-performance metal-sulfur batteries."
990,Using a self-adaptive grey fractional weighted model to forecast Jiangsu's electricity consumption in China,"Zhu, Xiaoyue; Dang, Yaoguo; Ding, Song","The remarkable prediction performance of electricity consumption has always assumed particular importance for electric power utility planning and economic development. On account of the complexity and uncertainty of the electricity system, this paper establishes a self-adaptive grey fractional weighted model to predict Jiangsu's electricity consumption, which efficiently enhances the prediction quality of electricity consumption. This newly constructed grey model introduces the fractional weighted coefficients to design a novel initial condition. Compared with the old one in the conventional grey models, the newly optimized initial condition has a flexible structure, which has advantages in capturing the dynamic characteristics of the electricity consumption observations. In addition, to further promote the forecasting precision, the adjustable fractional weighted coefficients and corresponding time parameter of the initial condition are estimated by utilizing the Particle Swarm Algorithm (PSO). Furthermore, five competing models are employed to forecast Jiangsu's electricity consumption in China, which certifies the validity of the established model. Experimental results illustrate that the newly designed model has significant advantages over other five competing models. According to the forecasted results, electricity consumption in Jiangsu Province is expected to reach 6778 billion kilowatt-hours in 2020, while the growth rate will fall down by 1.11%. Therefore, several proposals are made for decision-makers. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."
991,Activity of Ligustrum vulgare L extracts against acute pancreatitis in murine models by regulation of p38 MAPK and NF-κB signaling pathways,"Jing Zhang,Yi Wang,Bo Liu,Xiaoyun Liu,Zhengqin Xu,Jing Zhang,Yi Wang,Bo Liu,Xiaoyun Liu,Zhengqin Xu","Pancreatitis is a fatal disease associated with significant mortality and morbidity. At present, no specific treatment is available for pancreatitis and the patients are mainly treated with supportive medication. The need for specific antipancreatitic chemotherapy is an urgent medical obligation. In the current study, protective effects of the methanolic extract of the Ligustrum vulgare berries were investigated in the rat model of acute pancreatitis. Acute pancreatitis (AP) was induced in the male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats by cerulein injection. Fruit extract of L. vulgare L extract was prepared using the methanol. Treatment effects of L. vulgare were evaluated in AP rats. Serum levels of lipase, amylase, proinflamatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-6, TL-1β), lipid peroxidase (LPO), myeloperoxidase (MPO) were determined. Histological changes in the pancreas were assessed. L. vulgare treatment prevented the increase in serum amylase and lipase levels, reduced the disease progression in pancreas, and reduced the serum levels of tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin (IL)-6, and IL-1β in AP rats. Moreover, L. vulgare significantly suppressed pancreatic edema, inhibited oxidative damage (MPO activity and SOD activity), and inhibited the expression of NF-κB/p65 and activation (phosphorylation) of the inhibitor of NF-κB (IκBα) and p38 MAPKs. Histological examinations showed that L. vulgare significantly reduced the inflammatory and fibrotic changes. The results indicated the potent pancreato-protective effects of L. vulgare in AP."
992,Moving beyond velocity derivatives; using global positioning system data to extract sequential movement patterns at different levels of rugby league match-play,"Neil Collins,Ryan White,Anna Palczewska,Dan Weaving,Nicholas Dalton-Barron,Ben Jones,Neil Collins,Ryan White,Anna Palczewska,Dan Weaving,Nicholas Dalton-Barron,Ben Jones","This study aims to (a) quantify the movement patterns during rugby league match-play and (b) identify if differences exist by levels of competition within the movement patterns and units through the sequential movement pattern (SMP) algorithm. Global Positioning System data were analysed from three competition levels; four Super League regular (regular-SL), three Super League (semi-)Finals (final-SL) and four international rugby league (international) matches. The SMP framework extracted movement pattern data for each athlete within the dataset. Between competition levels, differences were analysed using linear discriminant analysis (LDA). Movement patterns were decomposed into their composite movement units; then Kruskal-Wallis rank-sum and Dunn post-hoc were used to show differences. The SMP algorithm found 121 movement patterns comprised mainly of ""walk"" and ""jog"" based movement units. The LDA had an accuracy score of 0.81, showing good separation between competition levels. Linear discriminant 1 and 2 explained 86% and 14% of the variance. The Kruskal-Wallis found differences between competition levels for 9 of 17 movement units. Differences were primarily present between regular-SL and international with other combinations showing less differences. Movement units which showed significant differences between competition levels were mainly composed of low velocities with mixed acceleration and turning angles. The SMP algorithm found 121 movement patterns across all levels of rugby league match-play, of which, 9 were found to show significant differences between competition levels. Of these nine, all showed significant differences present between international and domestic, whereas only four found differences present within the domestic levels. This study shows the SMP algorithm can be used to differentiate between levels of rugby league and that higher levels of competition may have greater velocity demands.Highlights This study shows that movement patterns and movement units can be used to investigate team sports through the application of the SMP frameworkOne hundred and twenty-one movement patterns were found to be present within rugby league match-play, with the walk- and jog-based movement units most prevalent. No movement pattern was unique to a single competition level.Further analysis revealed that the majority of movement units analysed had significant differences between international and domestic rugby league, whereas only four movement units (i.e. f,m,n,q) had significant differences within the two domestic rugby league levels.International rugby league had higher occurrences of the movement patterns consisting of higher velocity movement units (ie. T,S,y). This suggests that international rugby league players may need greater high velocity exposure in training."
993,"Assessment of parabolic trough solar collector assisted solar still at various saline water mediums via energy, exergy, exergoeconomic, and enviroeconomic approaches","Hassan, Hamdy; Yousef, Mohamed S.; Fathy, Mohamed; Ahmed, M. Salem","The performance of parabolic trough solar collector (PTC) coupled with single slope solar still at various water mediums is assessed based on productivity, energy, exergy, exergoeconomic, and enviroeconomic methodologies and also Energy payback time. Six solar still systems are considered; conventional solar still (CSS), CSS coupled with PTC (CSS + PTC), CSS contains steel wire mesh in the basin (CSS + WM), CSS contains wire mesh and coupled with PTC (CSS + WM + PTC), CSS contains sand in the basin (CSS + SD), and CSS contains sand and integrated with PTC (CSS + SD + PTC). Experiments are conducted under hot and cold climate conditions of Sohag city, Egypt. Findings show that the maximum freshwater yield in summer is achieved in case of CSS + SD + PTC with an increase of 1.21% compared to CSS and 102.1% compared to CSS + SD + PTC in winter. The maximum increase of the energy and exergy output per year compared to CSS is achieved in case of CSS + SD + PTC of 216.6% and 325%, respectively. Incorporation PTC with the still for all studied water mediums is found promising in terms of energy payback time, cost and freshwater yield compared to CSS without PTC. The exergoeconomic and environmental parameters of the active systems are found more effective related to those of passive systems. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."
994,Performance optimization through response surface methodology of an integrated biomass gasification based combined heat and power plant employing solid oxide fuel cell and externally fired gas turbine,"Roy, Dibyendu; Samanta, Samiran; Ghosh, Sudip","Efficient energy utilization from renewable energy sources can resolve multidimensional problems of environ-mental pollution, energy security and reduction in conventional fossil fuel reserves. In this circumstance, bio-mass-based energy systems can play an important role. In this study, modeling and analysis of an advanced integrated co-generation system comprising of a biomass gasifier, a solid oxide fuel cell module and a heat recovery steam generator have been carried out for generating power and process heat. The proposed system has been evaluated through exergetic and economic methods. Furthermore, response surface methodology has been applied for the multi-objective optimization of the system. Current density, pressure ratio of the secondary air compressor and saturation pressure of steam at the heat recovery steam generator are considered as the inputs for predicting the optimum performance parameters i.e., exergy efficiency, levelized cost of energy and levelized cost of exergy. Regression models, generated from the analysis of variance tool, are found to have a very high degree of accuracy for the exergy efficiency, levelized cost of energy and levelized cost of exergy. The optimal levels of the current density, pressure ratio and saturation pressure of steam are found to be 5101.01 A/m(2), 4 and 12 bar, respectively. At this optimum condition, exergy efficiency, levelized cost of energy and levelized cost of exergy of the cogeneration system are 46.58%, 0.0454 $/kWh and 0.0657$/kWh, respectively. Composite de-sirability is found to be on the higher side (around 0.90), which indicate that the setting seems to attain fa-vorable results for all the responses as a whole."
995,A new measure of Italian hidden energy poverty,"Betto, Frida; Garengo, Patrizia; Lorenzoni, Arturo","As highlighted by European policymakers and academic research, the global economic crisis of 2008 emphasized the energy poverty phenomenon. A number of households have had to considerably reduce their energy expenditure but the traditional criteria adopted to calculate energy poverty are not able to measure their number. Placed in this framework, the paper aims to define a new measure of hidden energy poverty suitable to identify which Italian households restrain their energy consumption due to their inability to afford energy services. A review of the available energy poverty metrics supports the definition of a new indicator that is able to include hidden energy-poor consumers considering some key peculiarities such as the poor energy efficiency of buildings, the poverty situation, low energy consumption and sensitivity to the climate. Using data from the Household Budget Survey provided by the Italian National Institute of Statistics in 2018, the newly identified indicator supports the assessment of the percentage of Italian households in hidden energy poverty and supplies useful insight to policymakers in their effort to support vulnerable consumers."
996,Coupling of economic growth and reduction in carbon emissions at the efficiency level: Evidence from China,"Sheng, Pengfei; Li, Jun; Zhai, Mengxin; Huang, Shoujun","Our work provides a comprehensive investigation of the coupling between the efficiency of economic growth and the efficiency of carbon emissions reduction in China, and makes a distinction between the coupling over the long-run and the short-run. Our estimates suggested significant evidence of coupling between economic growth and efficiency in carbon emissions reduction in the long-run, but China's economic growth still increased carbon emissions at the aggregate level. In the short-run, coupling effects were different across provinces that were at different stages of economic development. Provinces with low- and high-stages of development saw positive short-run coupling, but provinces at the intermediate stage of development saw the contrary, which resulted in an obvious ""U"" shaped relationship between short-run coupling effects and real GDP per capita. Finally, our findings provide an economic rationale for differentiated low-carbon policies. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."
997,Chronic subdural haematoma: the role of peri-operative medicine in a common form of reversible brain injury,"D J Stubbs,B M Davies,D K Menon,D J Stubbs,B M Davies,D K Menon","Epidemiological studies project a significant rise in cases of chronic subdural haematoma over the next 20 years. Patients with this condition are frequently older and medically complex, with baseline characteristics that may increase peri-operative risk. The intra-operative period is only a small portion of a patient's total hospital stay, with a majority of patients in the United Kingdom transferred between institutions for their surgical and rehabilitative care. Definitive management remains surgical, but peri-operative challenges exist which resonate with other surgical cohorts where multidisciplinary working has become the gold standard. These include shared decision-making, medical optimisation, the management of peri-operative anticoagulation and the identification of key points of equipoise for examination in the future trials. In this narrative review, we use a stereotyped patient journey to provide context to the recent literature, highlighting where multidisciplinary expertise may be required to optimise patient care and maximise the benefits of surgical management. We discuss the triage, pre-operative optimisation, intra-operative management and immediate postoperative care of patients undergoing surgery for a chronic subdural haematoma. We also discuss where adjunctive medical management may be indicated. In so doing, we present the current and emerging evidence base for the role of an integrated peri-operative medicine team in the care of patients with a chronic subdural haematoma."
998,Investigating the EKC hypothesis for China: the role of economic complexity on ecological footprint,"Yilanci, Veli; Pata, Ugur Korkut","This empirical study aims to test the validity of the environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) hypothesis for China within the framework of (Narayan and Narayan Energy Policy 38(1):661-666, 2010) approach. To this end, the study employs a recently developed Fourier ARDL procedure and time-varying causality test over the period 1965-2016 to analyze the short- and long-term relationships between economic growth, economic complexity index, energy consumption, and ecological footprint. The findings of the Fourier ARDL procedure confirm the existence of cointegration among the series. Moreover, the results of this study demonstrate that energy consumption and ecological complexity increase ecological footprint in both the short- and long term. However, the short-term elasticity of economic growth is smaller than the long-term elasticity, implying that the EKC hypothesis is not valid for China. This finding is robust as it is confirmed by the time-varying causality test. The overall results illustrate that economic complexity has an increasing impact on ecological footprint, and economic growth is not effective to solve environmental problems in China. Therefore, the Chinese government should encourage a more environmentally friendly production process and cleaner technologies in exports to reduce environmental pollution."
999,Valuing wetland ecosystem services based on benefit transfer: A meta-analysis of China wetland studies,"Zhou, Jingbo; Wu, Jian; Gong, Yazhen","While wetlands contribute significantly to ecosystem services, their nature as a public good implies that the public sector, rather than the market, values their conservation, utilization, and trade-offs among various ecosystem services. Thus, the valuation of wetlands and their ecosystem services is important for policy makers. This study conducts a meta-analysis of valuation research on China's wetlands based on 133 independent studies involving 146 cases published during 2000-2017. The study evaluates the weight of different factors in the existing valuation results, discusses the errors of benefit transfer, and applies the benefit transfer method to evaluate the ecosystem services of Yancheng wetland in Jiangsu province. The primary results are as follows. Wetland size influences wetland service valuation results most significantly. The value of all ecosystem services increases as wetland area increases with an average elasticity of 0.83. Factors such as economic and social development level, wetland type, research time, literature source, and valuation methods have impacts only on several individual service types. It is feasible to apply the meta-analysis results to benefit transfer. Compared with the per unit area value model, which is more stable in transfer errors, the wetland service value has better goodness of fit. Therefore,in conducting benefit transfer, the wetland service value models are suggested. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."
1000,Is negativity bias intuitive for liberals and conservatives?,"Metin Ege Salter,Firat Yavuz Duymaç,Onurcan Yilmaz,Hasan G Bahçekapili,Mehmet Harma,Metin Ege Salter,Firat Yavuz Duymaç,Onurcan Yilmaz,Hasan G Bahçekapili,Mehmet Harma","Previous research suggests that conservatives (right-wingers) tend to show more negativity bias than liberals (left-wingers) in several tasks. However, the majority of these studies are based on correlational findings and do not provide information on the cognitive underpinnings of this tendency. The current research investigated whether intuition promotes negativity bias and mitigates the ideological asymmetry in this domain in three underrepresented, non-western samples (Turkey). In line with the previous literature, we defined negativity bias as the tendency to interpret ambiguous faces as threatening. The results of the lab experiment revealed that negativity bias increases under high-cognitive load overall. In addition, this effect was moderated by the participants' political orientation (Experiment 1). In other words, when their cognitive resources were depleted, liberals became more like conservatives in terms of negativity bias. However, we failed to conceptually replicate this effect using time-limit manipulations in two online preregistered experiments during the COVID-19 pandemic, where the baseline negativity bias is thought to be already at peak. Thus, the findings provide no strong evidence for the idea that intuition promotes negativity bias and that liberals use cognitive effort to avoid this perceptual bias."
1001,Role of mesonephric contribution to mouse testicular development revisited,"Gerald R Cunha,Mei Cao,Sena Aksel,Amber Derpinghaus,Laurence S Baskin,Gerald R Cunha,Mei Cao,Sena Aksel,Amber Derpinghaus,Laurence S Baskin","The role of the mesonephros in testicular development was re-evaluated by growing embryonic day 11.5 (E11.5) mouse testes devoid of mesonephros for 8-21 days in vivo under the renal capsule of castrated male athymic nude mice. This method provides improved growth conditions relative to previous studies based upon short-term (4-7 days) organ culture. Meticulous controls involved wholemount examination of dissected E11.5 mouse testes as well as serial sections of dissected E11.5 mouse testes which were indeed shown to be devoid of mesonephros. As expected, grafts of E11.5 mouse testes with mesonephros attached formed seminiferous tubules and also contained mesonephric derivatives. Grafts of E11.5 mouse testes without associated mesonephros also formed seminiferous tubules and never contained mesonephric derivatives. The consistent absence of mesonephric derivatives in grafts of E11.5 mouse testes grafted alone is further proof of the complete removal of the mesonephros from the E11.5 mouse testes. The testicular tissues that developed in grafts of E11.5 mouse testes alone contained canalized seminiferous tubules composed of Sox9-positive Sertoli cells as well as GENA-positive germ cells. The seminiferous tubules were surrounded by α-actin-positive myoid cells, and the interstitial space contained 3βHSD-1-positive Leydig cells. Grafts of E11.5 GFP mouse testes into wild-type hosts developed GFP-positive vasculature indicating that E11.5 mouse testes contain vascular precursors. These results indicate that the E11.5 mouse testis contains precursor cells for Sertoli cells, Leydig cells, myoid cells and vasculature whose development and differentiation are independent of cells migrating from the E11.5 mesonephros."
1002,"The financial development-environmental degradation nexus in the United Arab Emirates: the importance of growth, globalization and structural breaks","Shahbaz, Muhammad; Haouas, Ilham; Sohag, Kazi; Ozturk, Ilhan","This article revisits the nexus between financial development and environmental degradation by incorporating economic growth, electricity consumption and economic globalization in the CO2 emissions function for the period 1975Q(I)-2014Q(IV) in the United Arab Emirates. We apply structural break and cointegration tests to examine unit root and cointegration between the variables. Further, the article also uses the Toda-Yamamoto causality test to investigate the causal relationship between the variables and tests the linkages of the robustness of causality by following the innovative accounting approach. Our empirical analysis shows cointegration between the series. Financial development increases CO2 emissions. Economic growth is positively linked with environmental degradation. Electricity consumption improves environmental quality. Economic globalization affects CO2 emissions negatively. The relationship between financial development and CO2 emissions is U-shaped and inverted N-shaped. Further, financial development leads to environmental degradation, and environmental degradation in turn leads to financial development in the Granger sense."
1003,Classifier Fusion for Detection of COVID-19 from CT Scans,"Taranjit Kaur,Tapan Kumar Gandhi,Taranjit Kaur,Tapan Kumar Gandhi","The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. COVID-19 is found to be the most infectious disease in last few decades. This disease has infected millions of people worldwide. The inadequate availability and the limited sensitivity of the testing kits have motivated the clinicians and the scientist to use Computer Tomography (CT) scans to screen COVID-19. Recent advances in technology and the availability of deep learning approaches have proved to be very promising in detecting COVID-19 with increased accuracy. However, deep learning approaches require a huge labeled training dataset, and the current availability of benchmark COVID-19 data is still small. For the limited training data scenario, the CNN usually overfits after several iterations. Hence, in this work, we have investigated different pre-trained network architectures with transfer learning for COVID-19 detection that can work even on a small medical imaging dataset. Various variants of the pre-trained ResNet model, namely ResNet18, ResNet50, and ResNet101, are investigated in the current paper for the detection of COVID-19. The experimental results reveal that transfer learned ResNet50 model outperformed other models by achieving a recall of 98.80% and an F1-score of 98.41%. To further improvise the results, the activations from different layers of best performing model are also explored for the detection using the support vector machine, logistic regression and K-nearest neighbor classifiers. Moreover, a classifier fusion strategy is also proposed that fuses the predictions from the different classifiers via majority voting. Experimental results reveal that via using learned image features and classification fusion strategy, the recall, and F1-score have improvised to 99.20% and 99.40%."
1004,Combined multi-objective optimization and robustness analysis framework for building integrated energy system under uncertainty,"Wang, Meng; Yu, Hang; Jing, Rui; Liu, He; Chen, Pengda; Li, Chaoen","The optimal design of building integrated energy system is sensitive to the variation of uncertain parameters. For addressing the tradeoff of uncertainty and optimality-robustness, this study proposes a combined multi-objective optimization and robustness analysis framework for optimal design of building integrated energy system. The proposed framework includes two parts. In the optimization part, on the basis of scenario generation for capturing the uncertainties of renewable energy sources and energy demands, two-stage multi-objective stochastic mixed-integer nonlinear programming is conducted to optimize the system's economic and environmental objectives. Two decision-making methods are introduced to identify the final optimum solution from the obtained Pareto frontier. In the robustness-analysis part, a combined Monte Carlo simulation and optimization method is implemented to verify the robustness of the optimal solutions. The two parts of the framework are integrated to investigate the case of a hotel in Beijing, China. The results indicate that compared with the stochastic model, the deterministic model underestimates the annual total cost. Achieving economic and environmental optimum is conflicting and needs a trade-off through decision making. Moreover, in the robustness analysis, an acceptable robustness value is identified, considering both the selected objectives and the operation constraints' probability of failure. The Shannon-entropy-based final optimum solution exhibits the best comprehensive performance, with an annual total cost of $695 x 10(3)/year, an annual carbon emissions of 2100 tons/year, and an 8.81% probability of failure."
1005,Designing hydro-energy led economic growth for pollution abatement: evidence from BRICS,"Devi Prasad Dash,Aruna Kumar Dash,Narayan Sethi,Devi Prasad Dash,Aruna Kumar Dash,Narayan Sethi","Overutilized hydro-energy production through non-sustainable mode is detrimental for both the economy and the environment. Intermittent consumption of hydro-energy from non-sustainable production methods may induce deleterious impacts in terms of rapid pollution in the economy. This paper investigates the impacts of hydro-power consumption upon pollution for 5 BRICS countries from 1965 to 2019. Our balanced panel model shows that infrequent usages of hydro-power consumption led to more pollution over the year. This relation is also further explained by considering several macroeconomic factors, in the context of the growth scenario. Our empirical findings show that an increase in population and consequent rise in per capita income have exhibited positive impacts on pollution. Even, improved industrialized led production and investment in these economies contribute heavily towards pollution and declined environmental standards. Our results further state that intermittent usages of natural resources by population in terms of rising ecological footprint have resulted in higher emission intensity over the year. These findings underscore how rising hydro-power energy consumption has led to the rising pollution amidst the growth scenario in BRICS economies."
1006,Two-stage stochastic framework for energy hubs planning considering demand response programs,"Mansouri, Seyed Amir; Ahmarinejad, Amir; Javadi, Mohammad Sadegh; Catalao, Joao P. S.","The integrated use of electricity and natural gas has captured great attention over recent years, mainly due to the high efficiency and economic considerations. According to the energy hub design and operation, which allows using different energy carriers, it has turned into a critical topic. This paper develops a two-stage stochastic model for energy hub planning and operation. The uncertainties of the problem have arisen from the electric, heating, and cooling load demand forecasts, besides the intermittent output of the solar photovoltaic (PV) system. The scenarios of the uncertain parameters are generated using the Monte-Carlo simulation (MCS), and the backward scenario reduction technique is used to alleviate the number of generated scenarios. Furthermore, this paper investigates the effectiveness of demand response programs (DRPs). The presented model includes two stages, where at the first stage, the optimal energy hub design is carried out utilizing the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm. In this respect, the capacity of the candidate assets has been considered continuous, enabling the planning entity to precisely design the energy hub. The problem of the optimal energy hub operation is introduced at the second stage of the model formulated as mixed-integer non-linear programming (MINLP). The proposed framework is simulated using a typical energy hub to verify its effectiveness and efficiency. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."

In this work, we present the fabrication of LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 thin-film cathodes deposited by the industrially scalable AC magnetron sputtering technique on functional and cost-effective stainless steel current collectors. This is the first step toward battery downscaling, envisioning the fabrication of compact microbatteries for low-power energy supply. The thin-film strategy is crucial also for solid electrolyte fabrication that will allow the integration of high-energy-density batteries while overcoming most of the current battery challenges. In this work, the effect of film thickness on the material's electrochemical performance is discussed, correlating the observed structural and morphological evolution with the final electrochemical response. Moreover, the effect of iron diffusion from the current collector substrate into the cathode film is analyzed. The addition of a stable CrN barrier layer in between the substrate and the film is proposed to prevent Fe diffusion, with a direct positive influence on the electrochemical behavior. All in all, the obtained results will facilitate the practical implementation of LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 thin films as high-voltage cathodes in functional cost-effective microbatteries."
1008,Effect of the position of the interphalangeal joint on movements of the trapeziometacarpal joint during thumb opposition,"Hiroshi Kurumadani,Kazuya Kurauchi,Shota Date,Yosuke Ishii,Toru Sunagawa,Hiroshi Kurumadani,Kazuya Kurauchi,Shota Date,Yosuke Ishii,Toru Sunagawa","The Kapandji test is a simple method to score thumb opposition; however, the position of the interphalangeal joint of the thumb during this test has not been described. We aimed to quantitatively examine the effect of the thumb interphalangeal joint position on movements of the trapeziometacarpal joint during thumb opposition using the Kapandji test. The Kapandji test was carried out in 20 healthy participants during thumb interphalangeal joint extension and flexion. Movements of the joints and the activity of thenar muscles were recorded using motion capture and electromyography, respectively. We found that interphalangeal joint extension increased the trapeziometacarpal joint movement and thenar muscle activity compared with interphalangeal joint flexion, which contributed to thumb opposition at Kapandji Positions 0-6. These findings suggest the position of the thumb interphalangeal joint affects the trapeziometacarpal joint during thumb opposition, and assessment of thumb opposition using the Kapandji test is best done with the thumb interphalangeal joint in extension."

The most important risk factor for the development of EH is chronic exposure to unopposed estrogen. Histopathologically, EH can be classified into EH without atypia (benign EH) and atypical EH/endometrial intraepithelial neoplasia (EIN). Clinical management ranges from surveillance or progestin therapy through to hysterectomy, depending on the risk of progression to or concomitant EC and the patient´s desire to preserve fertility. Multiple studies support the efficacy of progestins in treating both benign and atypical EH. This review summarizes the evidence base regarding risk factors and management of EH. Additionally, we performed a systematic literature search of the databases PubMed and Cochrane Controlled Trials register for studies analyzing the efficacy of progestin treatment in women with EH."
1010,Wind power prediction using a novel model on wavelet decomposition-support vector machines-improved atomic search algorithm,"Li, Ling-Ling; Chang, Yun-Biao; Tseng, Ming-Lang; Liu, Jia-Qi; Lim, Ming K.","Wind power output is highly volatile and intermittent owing to the characteristics of wind energy. Large-scale wind power integration affects the stability of entire power system. Accurate wind power prediction facilitates to utilize wind energy, improve power supply quality and maintain stable operation of power grid. A hybrid prediction model combining wavelet decomposition, support vector machine and improved atom search algorithm is proposed to predict wind power output. Dynamic sinusoidal wave adaptive weight is introduced to improve the position update equation, and crossover and mutation operations are added to the end of each iteration to improve the search ability of atomic search algorithm. In the prediction process, the original wind power data is processed by wavelet decomposition and the non-stationary signal is decomposed into several detail sequences of different frequencies and approximate sequence to extract important wind power features to reduce the prediction error caused by data fluctuation. Prediction results of actual wind farm data prove the proposed model has prominent advantages in predicting performance. Three evaluation indexes of mean absolute error, mean absolute percent error and root mean square error decreased by at least 1.14%, 2.60% and 1.52%. The proposed method is conductive to reduce wind curtailment and improve the economic benefit of wind farm. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."
1011,"Exploring the Relationship between Urbanization and Ecological Environment Using Remote Sensing Images and Statistical Data: A Case Study in the Yangtze River Delta, China","Shao, Zhenfeng; Ding, Lin; Li, Deren; Altan, Orhan; Huq, Md. Enamul; Li, Congmin","With the rapid urban development in China, urbanization has brought more and more pressure on the ecological environment. As one of the most dynamic, open, and innovative regions in China, the eco-environmental issues in the Yangtze River Delta have attracted much attention. This paper takes the central region of the Yangtze River Delta as the research object, through building the index system of urbanization and ecological environment based on statistical data and two new indicators (fraction of vegetation coverage and surface urban heat island intensity) extracted from remote sensing images, uses the Entropy-TOPSIS method to complete the comprehensive assessment, and then analyzes the coupling coordination degree between the urbanization and ecological environment and main obstacle factors. The results showed that the coupling coordination degree in the study region generally shows an upward trend from 0.604 in 2008 to 0.753 in 2017, generally changing from an imbalanced state towards a basically balanced state. However, regional imbalance of urbanization and ecological environment always exists, which is mainly affected by social urbanization, economic urbanization, landscape urbanization, pollution loading and resource consumption. Finally, on the basis of the obstacle factor analysis, some specific suggestions for promoting the coordinated development of the Yangtze River Delta are put forward."
1012,Selective and efficient adsorption of Au (III) in aqueous solution by Zr-based metal-organic frameworks (MOFs): An unconventional way for gold recycling,"Chang, Ziyong; Li, Fangxu; Qi, Xiaoyue; Jiang, Bo; Kou, Jue; Sun, Chunbao","Recycling precious metals from secondary resources is of great environmental and economic significance. In this study, the Zr-based MOFs UiO-66-NH2 was synthesized and used to adsorb Au (III) in aqueous solution. The ultrafine particle size (similar to 50 nm), excellent crystallinity and huge specific surface area (1039.2 m(2).g(-1)) were verified by transmission electron microscope (TEM), powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) and surface area analysis. About 50 % Au (III) was adsorbed within 6 min and the maximum adsorption capacity at 298 K reached up to 650 mg.g(-1), showing superiority to traditional adsorbents. The general order kinetics model and Liu equation were suitable to describe the adsorption process, which was spontaneous, endothermic and driven by the increasing system entropy. Electrostatic attraction between -NH3+ and Au (III) anions and inner complexation to Zr-OH played a vital role in adsorption. Au (III) was reduced to Au degrees by amino groups via redox reaction certified by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), PXRD and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) analysis. Moreover, UiO-66-NH2 displayed high selectivity, robust stability and excellent reusability, making it an ideal candidate for gold recycling in industrial practice."
1013,Application of three prediction models in pesticide poisoning,"Peng Sun,Ludi Zhang,Lei Han,Hengdong Zhang,Han Shen,Baoli Zhu,Boshen Wang,Peng Sun,Ludi Zhang,Lei Han,Hengdong Zhang,Han Shen,Baoli Zhu,Boshen Wang","To establish a reasonable prediction model of pesticide poisoning and predict the future trend of pesticide poisoning in Jiangsu Province, so as to provide the basis for rational allocation of public health resources and formulation of prevention and control strategies, the number of pesticide poisoning in Jiangsu province from 2006 to 2020 was collected. Grey model (GM(1,1)) model, autoregressive integrated moving average model (ARIMA) model and exponential smoothing model were used for prediction and comparative analysis. Finally, the model with the best fitting effect was selected. The average relative errors of ARIMA(0,1,1)(0,1,0)12 model, Holt-Winters multiplicative model and GM(1,1) were 0.096, 0.058 and 0.274 separately. The fitting effect of GM model is the worst, while the fitting effect of ARIMA(0,1,1) (0,1,0)12 model and Holt-Winters multiplication model is relatively good, which can be basically used for prediction. Holt-Winters multiplicative model has the best fitting effect and the highest accuracy in predicting the number of pesticide poisoning. The numbers of pesticide poisonings in the next 3 years are 454, 410 and 368, with a total of 1232, according to the Holt-Winters multiplicative model. Through the prediction of the number of pesticide poisoning in the next 3 years, this paper also provides a basis for the formulation of pesticide-related policies in the future."
1014,Regional Anesthesia for Lumbar Spine Surgery: Can It Be a Standard in the Future?,"Jae-Koo Lee,Jong Hwa Park,Seung-Jae Hyun,Daniel Hodel,Oliver N Hausmann,Jae-Koo Lee,Jong Hwa Park,Seung-Jae Hyun,Daniel Hodel,Oliver N Hausmann","This paper is an overview of various features of regional anesthesia (RA) and aims to introduce spine surgeons unfamiliar with RA. RA is commonly used for procedures that involve the lower extremities, perineum, pelvic girdle, or lower abdomen. However, general anesthesia (GA) is preferred and most commonly used for lumbar spine surgery. Spinal anesthesia (SA) and epidural anesthesia (EA) are the most commonly used RA methods, and a combined method of SA and EA (CSE). Compared to GA, RA offers numerous benefits including reduced intraoperative blood loss, arterial and venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, perioperative cardiac ischemic incidents, renal failure, hypoxic episodes in the postanesthetic care unit, postoperative morbidity and mortality, and decreased incidence of cognitive dysfunction. In spine surgery, RA is associated with lower pain scores, postoperative nausea and vomiting, positioning injuries, shorter anesthesia time, and higher patient satisfaction. Currently, RA is mostly used in short lumbar spine surgeries. However, recent findings illustrate the possibility of applying RA in spinal tumors and spinal fusion. Various researches reveal that SA is an effective alternative to GA with lower minor complications incidence. Comprehensive insight on RA will promote spine surgery under RA, thereby broadening the horizon of spine surgery under RA."

Golam","Many studies have examined the effects of climate change on farmland value in developed countries, but our understanding of the impact of climate change on farmland value is still very limited, especially in developing countries. In this study, we aimed to assess the effects of climate change on farmland value in Bangladesh using the Ricardian model. Household-level data collected from seven selected agroecological zones in Bangladesh were used to estimate the relationships among farmland value and long-term climate, farm household, and policy variables. The results showed that the current land values of farmers are sensitive to climate. A new variable called ""flooding"" was added to the Ricardian model, and the results indicated that floods are responsible for reductions in farmland value, especially in lowland areas. Among the socio-economic variables, the availability of extension services and access to irrigation facilities were positively correlated with farmland value. The estimated marginal impact results suggested that increases in temperature were associated with losses in small farmland value, whereas the precipitation levels in both seasons positively influenced farmland value. Selected global climate models predicted that climate change would have a negative impact on land value depending on the climate model and source of farm income. The empirical findings obtained from this study are expected to contribute to the formulation of sustainable adaptation strategies to maintain farm productivity and farmland value in Bangladesh in the context of climate change."
1016,Multiscale modelling of Potts shunt as a potential palliative treatment for suprasystemic idiopathic pulmonary artery hypertension: a paediatric case study,"Sanjay Pant,Aleksander Sizarov,Angela Knepper,Gaëtan Gossard,Alberto Noferi,Younes Boudjemline,Irene Vignon-Clementel,Sanjay Pant,Aleksander Sizarov,Angela Knepper,Gaëtan Gossard,Alberto Noferi,Younes Boudjemline,Irene Vignon-Clementel","Potts shunt (PS) was suggested as palliation for patients with suprasystemic pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) and right ventricular (RV) failure. PS, however, can result in poorly understood mortality. Here, a patient-specific geometrical multiscale model of PAH physiology and PS is developed for a paediatric PAH patient with stent-based PS. In the model, 7.6mm-diameter PS produces near-equalisation of the aortic and PA pressures and [Formula: see text] (oxygenated vs deoxygenated blood flow) ratio of 0.72 associated with a 16% decrease of left ventricular (LV) output and 18% increase of RV output. The flow from LV to aortic arch branches increases by 16%, while LV contribution to the lower body flow decreases by 29%. Total flow in the descending aorta (DAo) increases by 18% due to RV contribution through the PS with flow into the distal PA branches decreasing. PS induces 18% increase of RV work due to its larger stroke volume pumped against lower afterload. Nonetheless, larger RV work does not lead to increased RV end-diastolic volume. Three-dimensional flow assessment demonstrates the PS jet impinging with a high velocity and wall shear stress on the opposite DAo wall with the most of the shunt flow being diverted to the DAo. Increasing the PS diameter from 5mm up to 10mm results in a nearly linear increase in post-operative shunt flow and a nearly linear decrease in shunt pressure-drop. In conclusion, this model reasonably represents patient-specific haemodynamics pre- and post-creation of the PS, providing insights into physiology of this complex condition, and presents a predictive tool that could be useful for clinical decision-making regarding suitability for PS in PAH patients with drug-resistant suprasystemic PAH."

CTL is known to be photochemically active, but little consideration has been given to the formation efficiency and possible toxicity of its photoproducts. In degassed tetrahydrofuran (THF) solution, we isolated the photoproduct of CTL and of its 25-hydroxy derivative (HOCTL), and X-ray crystal structures were obtained for HOCTL and the photorearrangement product. The X-ray crystal structure and its 1H NMR spectrum confirm the product structure as a pentacyclic HOCTL isomer. In the presence of air in THF, endoperoxide formation via [2+4] addition of 1O2* across the B ring of CTL or HOCTL becomes the dominant photoreaction. The UV spectrum and decay kinetics of the triplet state of HOCTL, the precursor of 1O2*, are determined by transient absorption spectroscopy. We confirm the proposed structure of the endoperoxide by X-ray crystallography. Kinetics analysis of quantum yields provides rate constants for photophysical and photochemical events."
1018,Eliciting positive emotion through strategic responses to COVID-19 crisis: Evidence from the tourism sector,"Shuyang Li,Yichuan Wang,Raffaele Filieri,Yuzhen Zhu,Shuyang Li,Yichuan Wang,Raffaele Filieri,Yuzhen Zhu","While social media are effective means of communicating with adverse customer emotions during a crisis, it remains unclear how tourism organisations can respond to pandemic crisis on social media to prevent negative aftermaths. Using a set-theoretical approach, we investigate how COVID-19 response strategies and linguistic cues of responses are intertwined to evoke positive emotions among consumers. This study entails a qualitative content analysis of tourism organisations' COVID-19 announcements and a social media analytics approach that captures consumers' emotional reactions to these announcements via their Twitter replies. Our results extend some well-established findings in the tourism crisis literature by suggesting that combining innovative response strategy, argument quality, and assertive language can reinforce positive emotions during the COVID-19 crisis. Taking organisational characteristics into consideration, we suggest that young established hotels utilise innovative response strategies, whereas retrenchment response strategies for all types of restaurants should be avoided during the COVID-19 crisis."
1019,Bioluminescence and ventilator-associated pneumonia caused by oral biofilm in ICU during COVID-19 -Is there a possible relationship?,"Betsy Joseph,Liviu Steier,Betsy Joseph,Liviu Steier","Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) has been claiming many lives in the intensive care unit (ICU) during COVID-19. Oral biofilm and bacterial contamination that can be passed on from the oral cavity to the lungs during endotracheal intubation has been found to be the main culprit. Bioluminescence-based assays are emerging as potential clinical diagnostics methods. Hence, we hypothesize that the bioluminescent imaging technique can be used in the ICU to determine the load of biofilm-associated with patients undergoing endotracheal intubation. Early detection of such infections and their management can effectively bring down mortality and influence the death rate in ICU caused due to VAP. Government agencies and policymakers should be made to take this issue of deaths in the ICU due to VAP more seriously and act judiciously to methods such as bioluminescence based on sound scientific evidence."
1020,Performance and Failure Mechanism of Fire Barriers in Full-Scale Chair Mock-ups,"Andre L Thompson,Ickchan Kim,Anthony Hamins,Matthew Bundy,Mauro Zammarano,Andre L Thompson,Ickchan Kim,Anthony Hamins,Matthew Bundy,Mauro Zammarano","The effectiveness and the failure mechanism of fire barriers in residential upholstered furniture were investigated by full-scale flaming tests on upholstered chair mock-ups. Six commercial fire barriers were tested in this study. Fire barriers were screened for (1) the presence of elements that are typically used in fire retardants and, (2) the presence of targeted fire retardants. For each fire barrier, triplicate flammability tests were run on chair mock-ups where polyurethane foam and polyester fiber fill were used as the padding materials, and each chair component was fully wrapped with the fire barrier of choice and a polypropylene cover fabric. The ignition source was an 18 kW square propane burner, impinging on the top surface of the seat cushion for 80 s. Results showed all six fire barriers reduced the peak heat release rate (as much as ≈ 64 %) and delayed its occurrence (up to ≈ 19 min) as compared to the control chair mock-ups. The heat release rate remained at a relatively low plateau level until liquid products (generated by either melting or pyrolysis of the padding material) percolated through the fire barrier at the bottom of the seat cushion and ignited, while the fire barrier was presumably intact. The flaming liquid products dripped and quickly formed a pool fire under the chair and the peak heat release rate occurred shortly thereafter. Ultimately, the ignition of the percolating liquid products at the bottom of the seat cushion was identified as the mechanism triggering the failure of the fire barrier."
1021,"Supply chain networks, wages, and labor productivity: insights from Lagrange. analysis and computations","Anna Nagurney,Anna Nagurney","The COVID-19 pandemic has dramatically demonstrated the importance of labor to supply chain network activities from production to distribution with shortfalls in labor availability, for numerous reasons, resulting in product shortages and the reduction of profits of firms. Even as progress has been made through vaccinations, issues associated with labor are still arising. Increasing wages is a strategy to enhance labor productivity and, also to ameliorate, in part, labor shortages, but has not, until this work, been explored in a full supply chain network context. Specifically, in this paper, a game theory supply chain network model is constructed of firms competing in producing a substitutable, but differentiated, product, and seeking to determine their equilibrium product path flows, as well as hourly wages to pay their workers, under fixed labor amounts associated with links, and wage-responsive productivity factors. The theoretical and computational approach utilizes the theory of variational inequalities. We first introduce a model without wage bounds on links and then extend it to include wage bounds. Lagrange analysis is conducted for the latter model, which yields interesting insights, as well as an alternative variational inequality formulation. A series of numerical examples reveals that firms can gain in terms of profits by being willing to pay higher wages, resulting in benefits also for their workers, as well as consumers, who enjoy lower demand market prices for the products. However, sensitivity analysis should be conducted to determine the range of such wage bounds. Ultimately, we observed, that the profits may decrease and then stabilize. This work adds to the literature on the integration of concepts from economics and operations research for supply chain networks and also has policy implications."
1022,SUMOylation regulates the number and size of promyelocytic leukemia-nuclear bodies (PML-NBs) and arsenic perturbs SUMO dynamics on PML by insolubilizing PML in THP-1 cells,"Seishiro Hirano,Osamu Udagawa,Seishiro Hirano,Osamu Udagawa","The functional roles of protein modification by small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) proteins are not well understood compared to ubiquitination. Promyelocytic leukemia (PML) proteins are good substrates for SUMOylation, and PML-nuclear bodies (PML-NBs) may function as a platform for the PML SUMOylation. PML proteins are rapidly modified both with SUMO2/3 and SUMO1 after exposure to arsenite (As3+) and SUMOylated PML are further ubiquitinated and degraded by proteasomes. However, effects of As3+ on SUMO dynamics on PML-NBs are not well investigated. In the present study, we report that (1) the number and size of PML-NBs were regulated by SUMO E1-activating enzyme, (2) SUMO2/3 co-localized with PML irrespective of As3+ exposure and was restricted to PML-nuclear bodies (PML-NBs) via covalent binding in response to As3+, and (3) As3+-induced biochemical changes in PML were not modulated by ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) in THP-1 cells. Undifferentiated and differentiated THP-1 cells responded to As3+ similarly and PML proteins were changed from the detergent soluble to the insoluble form and further SUMOylated with SUMO2/3 and SUMO1. ML792, a SUMO E1 inhibitor, decreased the number of PML-NBs and reciprocally increased the size irrespective of exposure to As3+, which itself slightly decrease both the number and size of PML-NBs. TAK243, a ubiquitin E1 inhibitor, did not change the PML-NBs, while SUMOylated proteins accumulated in the TAK243-exposed cells. Proteasome inhibitors did not change the As3+-induced SUMOylation levels of PML. Co-localization and further restriction of SUMO2/3 to PML-NBs were confirmed by PML-transfected CHO-K1 cells. Collectively, SUMOylation regulates PML-NBs and As3+ restricts SUMO dynamics on PML by changing its solubility."
1023,Advantages of nitrogen fertilizer deep placement in greenhouse gas emissions and net ecosystem economic benefits from no-tillage paddy fields,"Liu, T. Q.; Li, S. H.; Guo, L. G.; Cao, C. G.; Li, C. F.; Zhai, Z. B.; Zhou, J. Y.; Mei, Y. M.; Ke, H. J.","Unreasonable application of nitrogen (N) fertilizers gives rise to agricultural greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, causing increases in carbon footprint (CF). To solve such problems, scholars have proposed the practice of N deep placement (DPN), which has been proven to be an effective approach to enhance N use efficiency and reduce N loss. However, the effect of DPN on CF and net ecosystem economic benefit (NEEB) from no-tillage (NT) rice fields remains largely unknown. In this work, a field experiment was conducted with a random complete block design to investigate the differences in soil CH4 and N2O emissions, agricultural GHG emissions, grain yield, CF, and NEEB from NT paddy fields between urea deep placement (UDP) and urea broadcasting (UBC) in central China. The CF for the entire rice production chain can be calculated as the ratio of total GHG emissions to grain yield using a life-cycle approach. The novelty of this study lies in the examination of the integrated effects of DPN on GHG emissions, grain yield, CF and NEEB from NT paddy fields. The agricultural GHG emissions varied from 1297.0 to 1420.8 kg CO2-eq ha(-1). Chemical fertilizers dominated the GHG emissions. UDP resulted in 96.8 kg CO2-eq ha(-1) more emissions than UBC due to more consumption of diesel by machinery operations. Compared with UBC, UDP significantly reduced soil CH4 emissions by 36-39% and N2O emissions by 29-31%. The mitigation of soil CH4 and N2O emissions under UDP decreased the total GHG emissions by 34% and CF by 46%. Soil CH4 emissions accounted for 83-88% of the total GHG emissions. The NEEB under UDP was 48% higher than that under UBC. In conclusion, DPN can increase grain yield, reduce CF, and enhance NEEB from NT rice fields, and may be an economic and cleaner approach for rice production. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

1024,The Nexus between Entrepreneurship and Economic Growth: A Comparative Analysis on Groups of Countries,"Stoica, Ovidiu; Roman, Angela; Rusu, Valentina Diana","Our paper examines the potential effect of different types of entrepreneurship (in particular, early-stage entrepreneurship, opportunity-driven entrepreneurship, and necessity-driven entrepreneurship) on economic growth at a national level and aims to identify whether the contribution of entrepreneurship to economic growth differs according to the stage of economic development of a country. Our empirical analysis is based on the panel data, which covers 17 years (2002-2018) and 22 European countries, classified into two groups. The results suggest that all three types of entrepreneurship have a greater impact on economic growth for the entire sample of European countries, and some types of entrepreneurship are more important than others. We find that opportunity-driven entrepreneurship and early-stage entrepreneurship would be key factors in stimulating economic growth across the sample of European countries. Our estimations also show that opportunity-driven entrepreneurship would have a greater impact in transition countries, while necessity-driven entrepreneurship would have a stronger influence in the innovation-driven countries. The results of our research could be of interest to policymakers, as it can help in identifying and implementing the most appropriate measures to eliminate the obstacles in the macroeconomic environment that entrepreneurs face, and measures to support innovative entrepreneurial activities."
1025,"Characterization of the complete chloroplast genome of Zephyranthes phycelloides ( Amaryllidaceae, tribe Hippeastreae) from Atacama region of Chile","Roberto Contreras-Díaz,Mariana Arias-Aburto,Liesbeth van den Brink,Roberto Contreras-Díaz,Mariana Arias-Aburto,Liesbeth van den Brink","Sporadic rains in the Atacama Desert reveal a high biodiversity of plant species that only occur there. One of these rare species is the ""Red añañuca"" (Zephyranthes phycelloides), formerly known as Rhodophiala phycelloides. Many species of Zephyranthes in the Atacama Desert are dangerously threatened, due to massive extraction of bulbs and cutting of flowers. Therefore, studies of the biodiversity of these endemic species, which are essential for their conservation, should be conducted sooner rather than later. There are some chloroplast genomes available for Amaryllidaceae species, however there is no complete chloroplast genome available for any of the species of Zephyranthes subgenus Myostemma. The aim of the present work was to characterize and analyze the chloroplast of Z. phycelloides by NGS sequencing. The chloroplast genome of the Z. phycelloides consists of 158,107 bp, with typical quadripartite structures: a large single copy (LSC, 86,129 bp), a small single copy (SSC, 18,352 bp), and two inverted repeats (IR, 26,813 bp). One hundred thirty-seven genes were identified: 87 coding genes, 8 rRNA, 38 tRNA and 4 pseudogenes. The number of SSRs was 64 in Z. phycelloides and a total of 43 repeats were detected. The phylogenetic analysis of Z. phycelloides shows a distinct subclade with respect to Z. mesochloa. The average nucleotide variability (Pi) between Z. phycelloides and Z. mesochloa was of 0.02000, and seven loci with high variability were identified: psbA, trnSGCU-trnGUCC, trnDGUC-trnYGUA, trnLUAA-trnFGAA, rbcL, psbE-petL and ndhG-ndhI. The differences between the species are furthermore confirmed by the high amount of SNPs between these two species. Here, we report for the first time the complete cp genome of one species of the Zephyranthes subgenus Myostemma, which can be used for phylogenetic and population genomic studies."
1026,Variable histopathology features of neuronal dyslamination in the cerebral neocortex adjacent to epilepsy-associated vascular malformations suggest complex pathogenesis of focal cortical dysplasia ILAE type IIIc,"Hajime Miyata,Haruka Kuwashige,Tomokatsu Hori,Yuichi Kubota,Tom Pieper,Roland Coras,Ingmar Blümcke,Yasuji Yoshida,Hajime Miyata,Haruka Kuwashige,Tomokatsu Hori,Yuichi Kubota,Tom Pieper,Roland Coras,Ingmar Blümcke,Yasuji Yoshida","Focal cortical dysplasia type IIIc (FCD-IIIc) is histopathologically defined by the International League Against Epilepsy's classification scheme as abnormal cortical organization adjacent to epilepsy-associated vascular malformations (VM). However, the incidence of FCD-IIIc, its pathogenesis, or association with the epileptogenic condition remains to be clarified. We reviewed a retrospective series of surgical brain specimens from 14 epilepsy patients with leptomeningeal angiomatosis of Sturge-Weber syndrome (LMA-SWS; n = 6), cerebral cavernous malformations (CCM; n = 7), and an arteriovenous malformation (AVM; n = 1) to assess the histopathological spectrum of FCD-IIIc patterns in VM. FCD-IIIc was observed in all cases of LMA-SWS and was designated as cortical pseudolaminar sclerosis (CPLS). CPLS showed a common pattern of horizontally organized layer abnormalities, including neuronal cell loss and astrogliosis, either manifesting predominantly in cortical layer (L) 3 extending variably to deeper areas with or without further extension to L2 and/or L4. Another pattern was more localized, targeting mainly L4 with extension to L3 and/or L5. Abnormal cortical layering characterized by a fusion of L2 and L3 or L4-L6 was also noted in two LMA-SWS cases and the AVM case. No horizontal or vertical lamination abnormalities were observed in the specimens adjacent to the CCM, despite the presence of vascular congestion and dilated parenchymal veins in all VM. These findings suggest that FCD-IIIc depends on the type of the VM and developmental timing. We further conclude that FCD-IIIc represents a secondary lesion acquired during pre- and/or perinatal development rather than following a pathomechanism independent of LMA-SWS. Further studies will be necessary to address the selective vulnerability of the developing cerebral neocortex in LMA-SWS, including genetic, encephaloclastic, hemodynamic, or metabolic events."
1027,Optimal sizing and management strategy for PV household-prosumers with self-consumption/sufficiency enhancement and provision of frequency containment reserve,"Hernandez, J. C.; Sanchez-Sutil, F.; Munoz-Rodriguez, F. J.; Baier, C. R.","This study provides a methodology to assess the techno-economic performance of photovoltaic household-prosumers that jointly provide self-consumption/sufficiency enhancement (SCSE) and frequency containment reserve (FCR). It thus addresses the following issues: (i) battery aging; (ii) supercapacitors joined to batteries building hybrid storage systems; (iii) management strategies of SCSE and charge level in energy storage systems; (iv) an integrated system with a 1-ms simulation step and high-resolution inputs. The methodology was applied to one Spanish household-prosumer. The study compared three charge-level management strategies by using different technical and economic performance indicators and concluded that the deadband recovery was the best. Moreover, the best techno-economic indicators were achieved by broadening the storage capacity band of unrestricted operation for SCSE (30-90%). Regarding the prosumer sizing, the optimal converter-battery configuration was determined so as to minimize the total energy supply cost. Long-term performance confirmed that when FCR provision was added to the SCSE, profitability increased up to 14.01%, with a relatively low impact on battery aging. A sensitivity analysis guaranteed a cost reduction of 3.68% for the prosumer energy and of 16% for the storage system life cycle at the optimal hybrid storage sizing. This sizing involved a 1% supercapacitor hybridization and a time constant of 150 s for power splitting."
1028,Modeling and economic evaluation of carbon capture and storage technologies integrated into synthetic natural gas and power-to-gas plants,"Bassano, Claudia; Deiana, Paolo; Vilardi, Giorgio; Verdone, Nicola","The production of synthetic natural gas from coal and biomass gasification made it possible to obtain a product that can be used to replace easily the standard natural gas in the existing infrastructures. This paper follows and presents a study that was conducted on a synthetic natural gas plant integrated with carbon capture and storage technologies. The recent growth in the use of energy coming from renewable sources requires that balancing measures be taken for electricity grids, which, as can be easily imagined, is best accomplished by using multiple energy storage technologies. In particular, the power-to-gas technology allows renewable electrical energy to be transformed into methane via electrolysis and subsequent methanation. Moreover, the production of synthetic natural gas can be enhanced by using concentrated CO2 emitted by synthetic natural gas plants, coupling the coal gasification and methanation processes within the same plant. This paper compares and evaluates two distinct process configurations and their implementation with power-to-gas technology in Aspen Plus v.8. During the study, it was analyzed how the introduction of carbon capture and storage technologies affect the overall energy balance, as well as the individual performances of each configuration. The two cases proved to have similar efficiency; it was also observed that the integration of and carbon capture and storage technologies resulted in a negligible reduction in the efficiency of the system (approximately 1%). The integration of power-to-gas technologies led to a decrease in the efficiency of the system up to 30%. Based on the current emission allowances specified in the rules of the regulated market of CO2, it was also assessed how such technologies would be sustainable in terms of costs derived from the production of gas.. An analysis was in fact performed to estimate the costs associated with this type of plant and the results showed that the introduction of carbon capture and storage technologies in synthetic natural gas plants had a lower impact on the costs related to both the plant and the synthetic natural gas. In this respect, a sensitivity analysis of the most influent factors was performed as well. The results showed that, when it comes to the production of gas in in the power-to-gas process, the specific cost strongly depends on the price of electricity and the operating hours."

Recent studies have indicated that gamete-mediated mate choice likely occurs also in humans, but the mechanistic basis of the process has remained virtually unexplored. Here, we investigated whether female-induced modifications in sperm protein SUMOylation (post-translational modification of the proteome) could serve as a novel mechanism for gamete-mediated mate choice in humans. We treated the sperm of ten males with the oocyte-surrounding bioactive liquid (follicular fluid) of five females and investigated motility, viability and global protein SUMOylation status of the sperm in all (n = 50) of these male-female combinations (full-factorial design). All the measured sperm traits were affected by male-female combinations, and sperm protein SUMOylation status was also negatively associated with sperm motility. Furthermore, our results indicate that female-induced sperm protein SUMOylation is selective, potentially allowing females to increase sperm motility in some males, whereas decreasing it in the others. Consequently, our findings suggest that follicular fluid may non-randomly modify the structure and function of sperm proteome and in this way facilitate gamete-mediated mate choice in humans and possibly many other species. However, due to the relatively low number of female subjects and their potential infertility problems, our results should be replicated with larger subset of fully fertile women."
1030,Time-Lapse Embryo culture: A better understanding of embryo development and clinical application,"Silvana Márquez-Hinojosa,Luis Noriega-Hoces,Luis Guzmán,Silvana Márquez-Hinojosa,Luis Noriega-Hoces,Luis Guzmán","Conventional embryo assessment is performed by removing embryos from incubators at least once a day. However, it is static and limited to specific time points, reducing the amount of information that could potentially be obtained. Fortunately, the time-lapse system is a powerful technology that enables to observe embryo development progression by image acquisition at recurrent time intervals, without interfering in the culture conditions. There are numerous studies that used time-lapse incubators, focusing on embryo kinetics, patient characteristics and clinical outcomes. This review aims to find agreements in the literature concerning embryo kinetics and patient characteristics: age, body mass index, smoking habit, polycystic ovary syndrome and endometriosis; as well as culture conditions that involved culture media and oxygen concentration. Furthermore, they showed differences according to ploidy status, direct/reverse cleavage, gender and the potential association between embryo collapse and clinical outcomes."
1031,Quantifying and predicting the Water-Energy-Food-Economy-Society-Environment Nexus based on Bayesian networks - A case study of China,"Chai, Jian; Shi, Huiting; Lu, Quanying; Hu, Yi","The main objective of sustainable development is to ensure the current and future demand can be satisfied. Food, energy and water is the primary human demand. However, China is facing security issues of water, energy and food due to several economic, social and environmental impacts such as economic progress, population growth and environmental change. For this reason, it is important to evaluate the relationship between food, energy and water with sustainability aspects. Using Bayesian network models, we propose a quantitative analysis framework based on the Water-Energy-Food-Economy-Society-Environment Nexus. Under this framework, the causality relations between water, energy, food and economy, society, environment were studied and quantified. Additionally, the demand for water, energy, food was predicted from a perspective of systematic interaction. Different from previous studies, our research is more comprehensive, involving six subsystems. More importantly, we do research from a systematic point of view. Thirdly, the causality in the nexus was quantified. As a result, we found that water withdrawal is directly affected by population growth and energy demand, indirectly by other nodes in the nexus; energy demand is directly affected by GDP and population growth in the nexus; population growth is the only direct cause of changes in food demand. Projections show that the demand for water, energy and food in China will remain at [600,620) billion cubic meters, a growth rate of [4%, 8%) and [0%, 5%) with an average probability of 0.6772, 0.6128 and 0.7055 respectively from 2020 to 2030.

1032,"Interdependencies of lithium mining and communities sustainability in Salar de Atacama, Chile","Liu, Wenjuan; Agusdinata, Datu B.","Demand for clean technologies has increased global lithium (Li) production. However, the potential impacts of lithium extraction, especially on frontline communities, have not been studied holistically. This research assesses the community sustainability in Salar de Atacama, Chile. We developed a coupled natural-social systems framework to analyze the interdependencies of the lithium extraction and its impacts. Using data from the Chilean census, company sustainability reports, remote sensing, and media archives, we investigate the temporal dynamics of water availability, labor influx, employment, social activism, and corporate social responsibility. Our study finds that between 2002 and 2017, the total water storage declined at a rate of 1.16 mm/year. Compared to other uses, water consumption from Li-mining was higher by two orders of magnitude. Mining played a crucial role in creating greater migration impacts, as indicated in a high migration effectiveness index of 85% and 90%, respectively. Labor influx increased 2.3 times, whereas the role of local labor in mining decreased from 52% to 18%. Local social activism increased both in intensity and scale. Our interdependency framework and analyses show that Li-mining and local communities are closely linked at both local and regional scale through the sharing of water resources, economic opportunities, and resource governance.

1033,Myelination synchronizes cortical oscillations by consolidating parvalbumin-mediated phasic inhibition,"Mohit Dubey,Maria Pascual-Garcia,Koke Helmes,Dennis D Wever,Mustafa S Hamada,Steven A Kushner,Maarten H P Kole,Mohit Dubey,Maria Pascual-Garcia,Koke Helmes,Dennis D Wever,Mustafa S Hamada,Steven A Kushner,Maarten H P Kole","Parvalbumin-positive (PV+) γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) interneurons are critically involved in producing rapid network oscillations and cortical microcircuit computations, but the significance of PV+ axon myelination to the temporal features of inhibition remains elusive. Here, using toxic and genetic mouse models of demyelination and dysmyelination, respectively, we find that loss of compact myelin reduces PV+ interneuron presynaptic terminals and increases failures, and the weak phasic inhibition of pyramidal neurons abolishes optogenetically driven gamma oscillations in vivo. Strikingly, during behaviors of quiet wakefulness selectively theta rhythms are amplified and accompanied by highly synchronized interictal epileptic discharges. In support of a causal role of impaired PV-mediated inhibition, optogenetic activation of myelin-deficient PV+ interneurons attenuated the power of slow theta rhythms and limited interictal spike occurrence. Thus, myelination of PV axons is required to consolidate fast inhibition of pyramidal neurons and enable behavioral state-dependent modulation of local circuit synchronization."
1034,Mental Health and Alcohol Use during and before the Early Phases of the COVID-19 Pandemic,"Natalie Sumetsky,Jessica Frankeberger,Robert W S Coulter,Jessica G Burke,M Reuel Friedman,Christina Mair,Natalie Sumetsky,Jessica Frankeberger,Robert W S Coulter,Jessica G Burke,M Reuel Friedman,Christina Mair","The early phases of the coronavirus 19 disease (COVID-19) pandemic were associated with changes in psychological well-being and alcohol use. However, it is unclear whether these changes are artifacts of psychological well-being and alcohol use prior to the pandemic across different sociodemographic groups. We received surveys from 247 adult residents of Allegheny County, Pennsylvania (United States), with an oversampling of sexual- and gender-minority individuals. Responses included measures of psychological well-being, substance use, and sociodemographic characteristics. Unadjusted mean depression scores, anxiety scores, and number of drinking days increased for all age and income groups during COVID-19, while average number of drinks per drinking day and days intoxicated differentially increased or decreased by age and income groups. Using Bayesian seemingly unrelated regression, we assessed depression and anxiety symptoms and alcohol use during the early stages of the pandemic and one month before COVID-19 was first identified in Allegheny County concurrently. Those in the youngest (18-24) group drank on more days during (but not before) the pandemic than those in the 25-44 age group. Compared to cisgender women, gender-minority adults had higher depression scores during the early stages of the pandemic. Employed adults had lower anxiety scores during (but not before) the pandemic than adults who were unemployed. Those with past-year annual incomes above $80,000 had fewer drinks on average drinking occasions than those in the $40,000 or below group before (but not during) the pandemic. Patterns of psychological distress and alcohol use associated with the COVID-19 pandemic differ by subgroup compared to patterns prior to the pandemic. Interventions addressing worsening mental health outcomes and shifting alcohol use patterns must be sensitive to the needs of vulnerable groups, such as younger adults and those experiencing poverty or unemployment."
1035,"Groundwater quality for potable and irrigation uses and associated health risk in southern part of Gu'an County, North China Plain","Zhou, Yahong; Li, Peiyue; Chen, Meijing; Dong, Zihan; Lu, Changyu","The study area is a part of the North China Plain, where groundwater is heavily abstracted for drinking and irrigation purposes. Groundwater quality is adversely affected due to rapid economic development and urbanization. Therefore, the purposes of this study were to evaluate the suitability of groundwater for drinking and irrigation purposes and to quantify the associated human health risks in the southern part of Gu'an County, North China Plain. The matter-element extension method based on entropy weight was used to evaluate the water quality for drinking, while sodium adsorption ratio, sodium percentage (%Na), residual sodium carbonate and magnesium hazard were used to evaluate the water quality for irrigation. Non-carcinogenic and carcinogenic health risks via different exposure ways were evaluated for different age groups. The study found that the quality of both deep and shallow groundwater in this area was generally suitable for drinking. Deep water quality has better quality than the shallow water. However, 8.70% and 73.92% of water samples pose non-carcinogenic health risks on adults and children, respectively. Children and adults are also at cancer risk due to Cr6+ and As in drinking groundwater in this area. The main responsible parameters for non-carcinogenic risk are Cr6+, F- and Fe, and Cr6+ is also responsible for carcinogenic risk. These toxic elements are mainly from industries. Therefore, deterioration of groundwater quality can be prevented by strengthening the sewage management of various industries."
1036,Environmental management and labor productivity: The moderating role of quality management,"Ma, Yuan; Zhang, Qiang; Yin, Hua","Abundant studies have been made around the impact of environmental management on economic performance in business, but there is still no consistent conclusion. This study focuses on labor productivity as a measure of economic performance. We argue that environmental management has a negative impact on the labor productivity of company in the special context of Chinese increasingly stringent environmental regulations, but this impact is moderated by quality management. Environmental management score and the years that companies have passed ISO 9001 are set as proxies for independent and moderating variable respectively. A sample including 229 Chinese listed companies is used to test the hypotheses by multiple regression analysis. Results show that environmental management has a negative impact on labor productivity, and quality management moderates the relationship."
1037,Energy substitution effect on transport sector of Pakistan: A trans-log production function approach,"Lin, Boqiang; Raza, Muhammad Yousaf","Transport sector of Pakistan is one of the highest fossil fuel consumption and carbon dioxide (CO2) emission sector. As a key user of fossil fuel energy, Pakistan's transport sector has created many problems i.e. noise, air pollution, CO2 emissions and environmental problem. In this study, trans-log production function model for Pakistan's transport sector is established and input factors of labor, capital, and energy consumption are comprised. The output elasticity of an individual, input elasticity between a pair of factors, and elasticity of substitution between input factors are analyzed. To manage the multicollinearity issue, ridge regression is applied at different values of K. From 1991 to 2018, the outcomes show that output elasticities and a pair of input factor's elasticities are increasing. The elasticities of substitutions between labor-energy consumption and capital-energy consumption show higher outcomes because of the more elevated amount of substitution elasticities. The substitution elasticity between labor and capital starts from 0.9797 to 0.9326 with slightly decreasing trend. The outcomes suggest that maximum output can be achieved by increasing capital and energy technologies. By allocating the maximum capital in the transport industry, energy-saving technologies, substitution between energy and capital, and substitution among capital-labor can enhance environmental protection. In the above's view function, the present study estimates the level of energy-saving and CO2 emissions reduction under the different scenarios from 2015 to 2018. The policy suggestions of the results are given below. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."

Soils acts as the sink to supply P to plants because soil pH and its physical condition are the main factor which regulate the solubility and availability P element. Phosphorus is not deficient in Pakistani soils but its availability to plants is the serious matter of concern. A pot experiment was conducted to evaluate P dynamics in two different soil series of Pakistan (Bahawalpur and Lyallpur) using Maize as test crop. The treatments applied were T0: Control (without any fertilizer), T1: Recommended DAP @648 mg pot-1, T2: Half dose DAP @324 mg pot-1, T3: Recommended rate of TSP @900 mg pot-1, T4: Half dose TSP @450 mg pot-1. Soil analysis showed that Bahawalpur soil has sandy clay loam texture with 33% clay and Lyallpur series has sandy loam texture with 15.5% clay; furthermore, these soil contain 4.6 and 2.12% CaCO3 respectively. Results showed an increase in P concentration in roots (23 mg kg-1) with the application of half dose of TSP in Lyallpur series and lowest in Bahawalpur series (14.6 mg kg-1) at recommended dose of DAP. Concentration of P in shoots responded the same; increase at half dose of TSP (16.7 mg kg-1) and lowest at full dose of DAP in Bahawalpur series as (15.58 mg kg-1). Adsorbed P (17 mg kg-1) was recorded highest in Bahawalpur soil with more clay amount in pot with DAP application but lower in Lyallpur soil series (14 mg kg-1) with the application of applied TSP. The PUE was recorded highest in Lyallpur series with the application of half dose of TSP and it was 61% more than control and was Highest in Bahawalpur series was with the application of recommended dose of DAP is 72% more than control treatment. On estimation; results showed that applied sources made an increase in P availability than control, but TSP gave better P uptake than DAP unless of rates applied. Soil of Lyallpur series showed better uptake of P and response to applied fertilizers than Bahawalpur series which showed more adsorption of P by high clay and CaCO3 amount. Conclusively, the study suggested that soil series play a crucial role in choosing fertilizer source for field application."

Several clinical advances have been made in the past decade with regards to optimal treatment strategies in early-stage (T1-2, node negative tumours) and locally advanced cancers (T3-4 and/or nodal positivity) utilizing a multimodal approach of surgery, neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy, and adjuvant chemotherapy, all aiming to optimize oncological outcomes, while minimizing associated morbidity. This narrative review aimed to summarize trial level evidence apropos the management of early and locally advanced rectal cancer. All relevant prospective clinical trials were identified through a computer-assisted search of PubMed, EMBASE, Medline databases between 1990 and 30 June 2021. With regards to early rectal cancer, there is limited trial-level evidence in the literature. Total mesorectal excision (TME) is the current standard of care, but local excision could be considered in select patients with pT1 tumours, or patients with near or complete clinical response to neoadjuvant CRT. As for locally advanced rectal cancer, the current standard of care consists of long-course chemotheradiotherapy or short-course radiotherapy, followed by TME. However, the role of total neoadjuvant therapy is promising, with respect to both oncological outcomes, as well as in reducing toxicity. Both induction and consolidation chemotherapy treatment approaches have been described in literature, with encouraging early results. The optimal management of rectal cancer is constantly evolving. More research is needed to investigate the long-term oncological and functional outcomes following new multimodal therapies in the management of early-stage and locally advanced rectal cancer."

With the promotion of China's sustainable development, improving the eco-efficiency of industrial parks has gradually become the focus of attention. In this study, a slack-based data envelopment analysis (SBM-DEA) model, which included three input indicators and six output indicators, was applied to assess the eco-efficiencies of 18 industrial parks in Central China. The ecological development level of different industrial parks in Central China was uneven, and their efficiency scores ranged from 0.06 to 1. Next, the most sensitive input and output variables are identified by sensitivity analysis, and it is concluded that land and water consumption will have a significant impact on the evaluation results of the model. Then, the influencing factors of eco-efficiency are discussed, and it was found that a reasonable energy structure and industrial structure, as well as high industrial added value, would increase the eco-efficiency of industrial parks. Finally, based on the findings, policy recommendations for improving the eco-efficiency of industrial parks are put forward, including fulfilling government responsibilities, adjusting energy and industrial structures, and improving the high-quality development of the parks."
1041,PET bottles recycling in China: An LCA coupled with LCC case study of blanket production made of waste PET bottles,"Zhang, Ruirui; Ma, Xiaotian; Shen, Xiaoxu; Zhai, Yijie; Zhang, Tianzuo; Ji, Changxing; Hong, Jinglan","A large number of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) bottles are discarded daily after usage. Thus, plastic bottle recycling has elicited considerable attention in recent years. In this context, this study aims to quantify the environmental and economic impacts of blanket production from 100% recycled waste plastic bottles in China through a life cycle assessment coupled with life cycle costing method. In addition, the environmental impact of replacing coal with natural gas and solar energy was evaluated. Results show that impact categories of global warming and fossil depletion have significant influence on the overall environment. Carbon dioxide, water, iron, coal and chromium (VI) to water are the main contributors to the overall environmental burden. The internal and external costs are $6433/metric ton and $370/metric ton, respectively. Analysis results indicate that the optimization of organic chemicals, recycled polyester filament and steam production processes can reduce environmental and economic burdens substantially. Energy substitutions with natural gas and the use of solar photovoltaic in steam production and electricity generation are effective measures for decreasing environmental impacts. Finally, suggestions based on research results and the current status of waste plastic bottle recycling in China are proposed."
1042,Quantifying the sustainability of three types of agricultural production in China: An emergy analysis with the integration of environmental pollution,"Su, Yue; He, Shan; Wang, Ke; Shahtahmassebi, Amir Reza; Zhang, Leping; Zhang, Jing; Zhang, Min; Gan, Muye","Agriculture is currently confronted with the great challenge of feeding a soaring population given finite resources while simultaneously curbing negative environmental impacts. Thus, the sustainability of different types of agricultural production must be quantified to identify the best way to meet the associated challenges. Taking the Tongxiang region as a case study, emergy and economic analyses were used to evaluate the overall performance of three agricultural production types, including traditional rice monoculture, integrated farming (i.e., rice-fish and rice-duck), and non-grain production (NGP) systems (i.e., nursery plantation, pond fish farming, vegetable production and duck rearing). The environmental pollution caused by different types of agricultural production, which is usually neglected in other studies, was included in the emergy accounting. The results show that intensive NGP systems, especially duck rearing and pond fish farming, were not sustainable, as indicated by high non-point source pollution discharge, high environmental pressure and low ecological sustainability. While rice monoculture and integrated farming systems were both under benign development, they could not provide economic profits competitive with those from NGP systems. With economic benefits increasing by 2.32-2.35 times and the agricultural non-point source pollution decreasing by 10.21%-59.01% in comparison with rice monoculture, integrated agricultural production proved to be a promising pattern for sustainable agriculture. Some policy incentives were proposed to increase the financial attractiveness of integrated agricultural production and promote a virtuous cycle for future cleaner production. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

1043,"Investigation on the role of economic, social, and political globalization on environment: evidence from CEECs","Destek, Mehmet Akif","This study aims to investigate the impact of different dimensions of globalization (i.e., overall globalization index, economic globalization index, social globalization index, and political globalization index) on environmental pollution by incorporating the real gross domestic product and energy consumption in Central and Eastern European Countries (CEECs). In doing so, the annual period from 1995 to 2015 is examined with second-generation panel data methodologies to consider the possible cross-sectional dependence among observed countries. The findings show that increasing overall globalization, economic globalization, and social globalization increases the carbon emissions while increasing political globalization reduces the environmental pollution. In addition, it is also found that Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) hypothesis is confirmed."

Dengue virus (DENV) is a member of the Flavivirus genus of the Flaviviridae family, which endangers public health. Limited studies have been performed in the Saudi Arabia and there are no epidemiological as well as molecular screening of DENV in the Southwestern region and this current study was conducted on the epidemiology of dengue in the Southwestern region of Saudi Arabia. Simultaneously, we have screened the 100 patients for DENV using the real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay. The current study results confirmed that 6637 people from various hospitals and locations in Jazan, Southwestern regions, were enrolled in this study from 2012 to 2020. The overall mean age was 30.02 ± 18.01 years, with 62.8% of males and 37.2% of females enrolled. This study included nearly three-fourths of the Saudi participants and one-fourth of the expatriates, and 56.6% of the positive cases were enrolled. In 2019, the most instances were enrolled, with 44% of positive cases. When screened using the RT-PCR assay, 93% of the positive patients were recruited, according to the quality control analysis. In conclusion, the current study results confirmed the prevalence of DENV was increased drastically since 2012 to 2020. High number of cases were registered prior to the Pandemic. The screening for DENV was performed with RT-PCR assay and NSI antigen should also be implemented to cross-check the results which was previously performed with RT-PCR analysis."

While the original system was designed with the primary focus on day-ahead power prediction in support of power trading, the enhanced system provides short-term forecasting for unit commitment and economic dispatch, uncertainty quantification in wind speed prediction with probabilistic forecasting, and prediction of extreme events such as icing. Furthermore, the empirical power conversion machine-learning algorithms now use a quantile approach to data quality control that has improved the accuracy of the methods. Forecast uncertainty is quantified using an analog ensemble approach. Two methods of providing short-range ramp forecasts are blended: the variational doppler radar analysis system and an observation-based expert system. Extreme events, specifically changes in wind power due to high winds and icing, are now forecasted by combining numerical weather prediction and a fuzzy logic artificial intelligence system. These systems and their recent advances are described and assessed."

A green process with prospective environmental and economic significance was experimentally and theoretically established for the sustainable extraction of gold from CT. The microwave roasting behavior and trajectory of gold in different gold-bearing bodies under microwave-enhanced roasting and conventional roasting conditions were explored and compared by introducing the concept of thermal and non-thermal effects provided by the microwave field. At the same time, the superiority of microwave chlorination roasting was verified by a series of experiments. Under the same conditions of the roasting experiments, the energy consumption of conventional calcination was more than double greater than that of microwave roasting. Finally, the essence of microwave chlorination roasting in the treatment of CT was summarized as a non-polluting process."

Data were drawn from the Environmental Risk Longitudinal Twin Study, a cohort of 2,232 individuals born in the United Kingdom in the mid-1990s. When participants were aged 18, they provided self-reports of loneliness, and informant ratings of loneliness were provided by interviewers, as well as participants' parents and siblings. Interviewers further provided Big Five personality ratings, and detailed written notes in which they documented their perceptions of the participants and their reflections on the content of the interview. In the quantitative section of the paper, regression analyses were used to examine the perceptibility of loneliness, and how participants' loneliness related to their perceived personality traits. The informant ratings of participants' loneliness showed good agreement with self-reports. Furthermore, loneliness was associated with lower perceived conscientiousness, agreeableness and extraversion, and higher perceived neuroticism. Within-twin pair analyses indicated that these associations were partly explained by common underlying genetic influences. In the qualitative section of the study, the loneliest 5% of study participants (N=108) were selected, and thematic analysis was applied to the study' interviewers' notes about those participants. Three themes were identified and named: 'uncomfortable in own skin', 'clustering of risk', and 'difficulties accessing social resources'. These results add depth to the current conceptualisation of loneliness, and emphasise the complexity and intersectional nature of the circumstances severely lonely young adults live in."
1050,Validation of wearable inertial sensor-based gait analysis system for measurement of spatiotemporal parameters and lower extremity joint kinematics in sagittal plane,"Gunjan Patel,Rajani Mullerpatan,Bela Agarwal,Triveni Shetty,Rajdeep Ojha,Javeed Shaikh-Mohammed,S Sujatha,Gunjan Patel,Rajani Mullerpatan,Bela Agarwal,Triveni Shetty,Rajdeep Ojha,Javeed Shaikh-Mohammed,S Sujatha","Wearable inertial sensor-based motion analysis systems are promising alternatives to standard camera-based motion capture systems for the measurement of gait parameters and joint kinematics. These wearable sensors, unlike camera-based gold standard systems, find usefulness in outdoor natural environment along with confined indoor laboratory-based environment due to miniature size and wireless data transmission. This study reports validation of our developed (i-Sens) wearable motion analysis system against standard motion capture system. Gait analysis was performed at self-selected speed on non-disabled volunteers in indoor (n = 15) and outdoor (n = 8) environments. Two i-Sens units were placed at the level of knee and hip along with passive markers (for indoor study only) for simultaneous 3D motion capture using a motion capture system. Mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) was computed for spatiotemporal parameters from the i-Sens system versus the motion capture system as a true reference. Mean and standard deviation of kinematic data for a gait cycle were plotted for both systems against normative data. Joint kinematics data were analyzed to compute the root mean squared error (RMSE) and Pearson's correlation coefficient. Kinematic plots indicate a high degree of accuracy of the i-Sens system with the reference system. Excellent positive correlation was observed between the two systems in terms of hip and knee joint angles (Indoor: hip 3.98° ± 1.03°, knee 6.48° ± 1.91°, Outdoor: hip 3.94° ± 0.78°, knee 5.82° ± 0.99°) with low RMSE. Reliability characteristics (defined using standard statistical thresholds of MAPE) of stride length, cadence, walking speed in both outdoor and indoor environment were well within the ""Good"" category. The i-Sens system has emerged as a potentially cost-effective, valid, accurate, and reliable alternative to expensive, standard motion capture systems for gait analysis. Further clinical trials using the i-Sens system are warranted on participants across different age groups."
1051,A Note on the Effect of COVID-19 and Vaccine Rollout on School Enrollment in the US,"Kolawole Ogundari,Kolawole Ogundari","The COVID-19 pandemic outbreaks forced families to decide the safest and most effective learning environments for their children because of the virus's threat to health and life. Hence, because of the nationwide school closure, policymakers have raised concerns about the missing children cases-those who have not enrolled in school at all because of the pandemic. The present study investigates whether there is a difference in the school enrollment during the pre-COVID-19 period, COVID-19 period, and vaccine rollout period. We employed the U.S. Current Population Survey (CPS), covering January 2020 to May 2021, while we use both the logistic and multinomial regression models for the empirical analysis. Our results showed that school enrollment is lower during the COVID-19 pandemic compared to the Pre-COVID-19 period. Other results showed that school enrollment is higher since vaccine rollout compared to the COVID-19 period. A possible explanation for this could be that families consider the vaccine the safe path to enrolling their children in school. We also found that school enrollment varies significantly across race and ethnic groups."
1052,"Globalization, electricity consumption and ecological footprint: An autoregressive distributive lag (ARDL) approach","Langnel, Zechariah; Amegavi, George Babington","In light of the growing need for countries to stay within their ecological limits, this paper examines how the current wave of globalization and electricity consumption drive human demands on ecological resources for Ghana from 1971-2016. Having accounted for structural breaks, the evidence from the Autoregressive Distributive Lag bound test shows that there is a long-run association between the variables. The results reveal that globalization positively and significantly stimulates the ecological footprint. More specifically, economic and social globalization inspire the ecological footprint whiles political globalization improves the environmental sustainability by exerting a reducing effect on the ecological footprint. We further demonstrate that electricity consumption particularly from fossil-fuel based energy source deteriorates the environmental quality. Moreover, economic growth and urbanization contribute to environmental degradation. Furthermore, the causality results disclose the feedback hypothesis between ecological footprint and electricity consumption and a one-way causal relationship running from globalization to ecological footprint. Some policy insights are elucidated premised on the evidence presented."
1053,Toward low-carbon development: Assessing emissions-reduction pressure among Chinese cities,"Cheng, Shulei; Fan, Wei; Meng, Fanxin; Chen, Jiandong; Cai, Bofeng; Liu, Gengyuan; Liang, Sai; Song, Malin; Zhou, Ya; Yang, Zhifeng","Assessing emissions-reduction pressure among Chinese cities is a critical task for local governments formulating and implementing environmental policies. From the perspectives of carbon intensity and carbon inequality, this study develops an improved carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions-reduction index to quantify emissions-reduction pressure on 284 cities in China. Results indicate that driven by the decrease of overall carbon intensity and the rise of inter-city carbon inequality, emissions-reduction pressure on 41.38% of provinces and 49.65% of cities was greater than the overall national level; emissions-reduction pressure on 52.35% of cities exceeded the provincial average level. The central government determines national emissions-reduction pressure by adjusting carbon-inequality tolerance between cities and determines carbon-inequality preference based on population and economic output principles. These determinations become benchmarks for local governments' CO2 emissions-reduction pressure. Provinces and cities that exceed benchmarks become foci for promoting energy savings, emissions reduction, and low-carbon development in the future."

The natural management of the aquatic stages of this pest is crucial for maintaining an insecticide-free and sustained environment. The present work focused on studying the biological and biochemical effects of the entomopathogenic fungi: Metarhizium anisopliae, Beauveria bassiana, and Paecilomyces lilicanus, against 3rd instar larvae of Culex pipiens laboratory colony. The results revealed that M. anisopliae showed maximum larval mortality (88%) with the lowest lethal time (LT50) (22.6 hrs) at 108 spores/ml followed by B. bassiana (73.33%) with LT50 (38.35 hrs), while P. lilicanus showed minimum percent mortality (65%) with highest LT50 (51.5 hrs). The median lethal concentration (LC50) values were found to be 1.027 × 105 spores/ml for M. anisopliae, 1.24 × 106 spores/ml for B. bassiana, while it was 8.453 × 106 spores/ml for P. lilicanus. A reduction in female fecundity, number of hatched eggs, pupation and adult emergence percentage were recorded. The biochemical analysis of the treated larvae revealed different quantitative decrease in total soluble proteins, lipids, and carbohydrate hydrolyzing enzymes compared to control. Histopathological effects of fungal infection upon insect cuticles, muscles, and midgut were investigated. Based on the obtained results, M. anisopliae proved its superior virulent effect as a bio-control agent against Cx. pipiens."
1055,Performance assessment and optimization of a biomass-based solid oxide fuel cell and micro gas turbine system integrated with an organic Rankine cycle,"Karimi, Mohammad Hossein; Chitgar, Nazanin; Emadi, Mohammad Ali; Ahmadi, Pouria; Rosen, Marc A.","Rice straw is a potential energy source for power generation. Here, a biomass-based combined heat and power plant integrating a downdraft gasifier, a solid oxide fuel cell, a micro gas turbine and an organic Rankine cycle is investigated. Energy, exergy, and economic analyses and multi-objective optimization of the proposed system are performed. A parametric analysis is carried out to understand the effects on system performance and cost of varying key parameters: current density, fuel utilization factor, operating pressure, pinch point temperature, recuperator effectiveness and compressors isentropic efficiency. The results show that current density plays the most important role in achieving a tradeoff between system exergy efficiency and cost rate. Also, it is observed that the highest exergy destruction occurs in the gasifier, so improving the performance of this component can considerably reduce the system irreversibility. At the optimum point, the system generates 329 kW of electricity and 56 kW of heating with an exergy efficiency of 35.1% and a cost rate of 10.2 $/h. The capability of this system for using Iran rice straw produced in one year is evaluated as a case study, and it is shown that the proposed system can generate 6660 GWh electrical energy and 1140 GWh thermal energy.

1056,"Heterogeneous effects of energy efficiency, oil price, environmental pressure, R&D investment, and policy on renewable energy - evidence from the G20 countries","Wang, Qiang; Li, Shuyu; Pisarenko, Zhanna","Understanding heterogenous effects of renewable energy consumption can serve to develop more precise strategies to promote renewable. This work is aimed to investigate the heterogeneous effects of five factors (energy efficiency, oil price, environmental pressure, research and development, and policy) on renewable energy consumption through an empirical analysis of the whole panel data of Group 20, three income groups, and 20 individual countries by using multiple co-integration estimation approaches. The results indicate that the effect of research and development is the leading contributor to promote renewable energy development in middle-income countries of Group 20, whereas the effect of policy is the major contributor to increase in renewable energy consumption in high-income countries of Group 20. It is worth noting that with the increase of income, the effects of policy and environmental pressure on promoting renewable energy are increasing, whereas the effect of research and development is declining. The analysis of these 20 individual countries indicates that research and development plays a leading role to promote renewable energy consumption in 60% of the countries, while the influence degree of policy and energy intensity rank second and third. These heterogeneity of the drivers of renewable energy should be considered to develop more precise and effective measures to accelerating renewable energy. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

1057,"COVID in Africa, one year later","Sandro Colombo,Maurizio Murru,Mark Beesley,Sandro Colombo,Maurizio Murru,Mark Beesley","This paper presents an update of last year analysis of COVID in sub-Sahara Africa (SSA). The number of confirmed cases and deaths has dramatically increased, partially driven by the expanded diagnostic capacity, but it is an unknown undercount of people infected: we are blind with respect to the real size of the pandemic. The aggregate numbers mask a substantial heterogeneity: South Africa accounts for almost half of the cases in the region; Ethiopia, the second top country in the ranking, follows from afar, with only 6% of reported cases. There are signs that the third wave of COVID, driven by the more transmissible Delta variant, is easing off.The concerns that the pandemic would have affected more severely the most vulnerable populations (refugees and internally displaced persons) have not been confirmed: there is no evidence of hospitals overwhelmed nor of high mortality in humanitarian settings, a pattern that has not found an explanation.As of now, only 1% of African has been vaccinated, a sign of vaccine inequity and of 'a catastrophic moral failure' of rich countries, which have secured a surplus of hundred million COVID vaccines that they cannot use.The combined effects of the pandemic and control measures have been particularly severe in SSA economies, where underemployment and job insecurity prevail. Reduced export of commodities, collapse of tourism and agriculture, decline of foreign investment, aid, and remittances have driven million Africans in extreme poverty. The international financial institutions have shifted their strategies from austerity to a strong package of grants and concessional loans to support poor countries, including those in SSA, to cope with the immediate consequences of the pandemic, under the lemma 'vaccine policy is the most important economic policy'."
1058,Induction and generalization of nocebo effects on itch,"Lingling Weng,Antoinette I M van Laarhoven,Kaya J Peerdeman,Andrea W M Evers,Lingling Weng,Antoinette I M van Laarhoven,Kaya J Peerdeman,Andrea W M Evers","Nocebo effects, that is, negative treatment outcomes due to negative expectancies, can increase itch. Moreover, indirect evidence has shown that nocebo hyperknesis can generalize to another itch modality. Knowledge on response generalization can help to prevent and decrease negative effects. The aims of this study were to investigate (1) the efficacy of inducing nocebo effects on cowhage-evoked itch via verbal suggestions and (2) whether these effects can generalize to (2a) mechanically evoked touch and (2b) mechanically evoked itch. Forty-four healthy participants watched a video suggesting that a nocebo solution increases cowhage-evoked itch and that a control solution does not affect itch. Subsequently, cowhage, mechanical itch, and mechanical touch stimuli were applied. Nocebo effects were measured as the difference in both mean and peak of the outcomes itch and urge to scratch between nocebo and control trials. Main analyses revealed significant nocebo effects on mean and peak itch for all stimuli. For urge to scratch, a significant nocebo effect was only observed for mechanical touch (peak). As mechanical stimuli did not induce pure sensations as planned, posthoc sensitivity analyses were run for mechanical stimuli that individually induced either touch or itch at baseline. These analyses showed similar results for generalization to mechanical itch, but generalization to mechanical touch was non-significant. This study showed that merely verbal suggestion can induce nocebo effects on cowhage-evoked itch and that these effects can generalize to another itch modality. Future studies may examine how to prevent negative experiences from generalizing to subsequent encounters."

This effort generates a large volume of scientific publications at a speed that makes the effective acquisition of new knowledge difficult. Therefore, Information Systems are needed to assist biosanitary experts in accessing, consulting and analyzing these publications. In this work we develop a study of the variables involved in the development of a Question Answering system that receives a set of questions asked by experts about the disease COVID-19 and its causal virus SARS-CoV-2, and provides a ranked list of expert-level answers to each question. In particular, we address the interrelation of the Information Retrieval and the Answer Extraction steps. We found that a recall based document retrieval that leaves to a neural answer extraction module the scanning of the whole documents to find the best answer is a better strategy than relying in a precise passage retrieval before extracting the answer span."
1060,Genotype diversity promotes the persistence of Daphnia populations exposed to severe copper stress,"Alessandra Loria,Melania E Cristescu,Andrew Gonzalez,Alessandra Loria,Melania E Cristescu,Andrew Gonzalez","When environmental stressors of high intensity are sustained for long periods of time, populations face high probabilities of being extirpated. However, depending on the intensity of the stressor, large populations with sufficient genetic diversity may persist. We report the results of an experiment that tracked the persistence of Daphnia populations exposed to copper contamination. We assessed whether genotypic diversity reduced the risk of extinction. We created monoclonal and multiclonal populations and monitored their population sizes during a 32-week experiment. Cu was applied at a sub-lethal concentration and then increased every week until the population sizes dropped to about 10% of the carrying capacity (Cu at 180 μg/L). The concentration was then increased up to 186 μg/L and held stable until the end of the experiment. A survival analysis showed that clonal diversity extended the persistence of Daphnia populations, but copper contamination caused a substantial genetic erosion followed by population extirpation. However, some Cu-treated populations, mostly multiclonal, showed U-shaped patterns of growth consistent with evolutionary rescue but these did not lead to lasting population recovery. These results highlight the importance of genetic variation for population persistence, but they also show how quickly it can be lost in contaminated environments."
1061,"Understanding COVID-19 diffusion requires an interdisciplinary, multi-dimensional approach","Bontempi, Elza; Vergalli, Sergio; Squazzoni, Flaminio","After COVID-19 initial diffusion in Europe in March 2020, research has suggested a direct correlation between environmental pollution and contagion dynamics (i.e., environment-to-human pollution), thereby indicating that mechanisms other than human-to-human transmission can explain COVID-19 diffusion. However, these studies did not consider that complex outcomes, such as a pandemic's diffusion patterns, are typically caused by a multiplicity of environmental, economic and social factors. While disciplinary specialties increase scholars' attitudes of concentrating on specific factors, neglecting this multiplicity during a pandemic crisis can lead to misleading conclusions. This communication aims to focus on certain limitations of current research about environmental-to-human COVID-19 transmission and shows the benefit of an interdisciplinary, multi-dimensional approach to understand the geographical diversity of contagion diffusion patterns."
1062,Analysis on the causes of the change in the north-south gap of industrial pollution discharge in China,"Xiao-Dong Zhang,Bin Li,Juan Lu,Al-Barakani Abdo,Xiao-Dong Zhang,Bin Li,Juan Lu,Al-Barakani Abdo","What are the causes of the change in the north-south gap of industrial pollution discharge in 2008 and 2016? In order to solve this problem, this paper makes theoretical and empirical research. The results show that (1) the difference in economic growth pattern transformation is the root cause of the change in the north-south gap of industrial pollution discharge.(2) The international financial crisis is the direct cause of the change in the north-south gap of industrial pollution discharge in 2008. The international financial crisis forced the industrial transformation and upgrading of the southern region, which made the TFP of the southern region relatively improve, and then led to the relative reduction of industrial pollution discharge in the southern region. (3) The supply-side structural reform is the direct cause of the change in the north-south gap of industrial pollution discharge in 2016. However, the supply-side structural reform proposed by the central government in 2016 is essentially a further continuation of the policy of ""resolving overcapacity"" implemented in 2013. In fact, the north-south gap in the growth rate of industrial discharge has changed since 2013."
1063,Forecasting annual electricity consumption in China by employing a conformable fractional grey model in opposite direction,"Xie, Wanli; Wu, Wen-Ze; Liu, Chong; Zhao, Jingjie","Electric power makes a significant contribution to economic development. Predicting annual electricity consumption is becoming increasingly crucial for electric power utility planning and economic development. To address this problem, a novel conformable fractional grey model in opposite direction is presented to predict annual electricity consumption in China. Firstly, the computational formulas for the novel model are deduced by grey modelling method and the effectiveness of the novel model is proved by matrix perturbation theory. Secondly, the optimal parameters are determined by quantum inspired evolutionary algorithm. Thirdly, two empirical examples are taken to validate the prediction accuracy of the novel model. Finally, the proposed model is applied to predict electricity consumption of Beijing, Fujian and Shandong. The results show that the novel model is superior to other six competitive models. Besides, electricity consumption of these regions in next five years are predicted, which can well serve a benchmark research and provide a relatively reliable reference for economic and electric sectors.

1064,The use of ecological footprint in estimating the Environmental Kuznets Curve hypothesis for BRICST by considering cross-section dependence and heterogeneity,"Dogan, Eyup; Ulucak, Recep; Kocak, Emrah; Isik, Cem","A vast body of literature estimates the impact of economic growth on environmental degradation in the framework of EKC model. Typical empirical studies proxy environmental degradation with CO2 emissions; however, this indicator does not consider the complex nature of environmental degradation. To fulfill this omission, ecological footprint that tracks the use of multiple categories of productive surface areas is used as proxy for the environment. Moreover, studies that do not consider issues of heterogeneity and cross-sectional dependence may not produce reliable outcomes. Hence, the present study re-investigates the validity of the EKC hypothesis for BRICST (Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa, Turkey) by using ecological footprint and considering the mentioned issues in the estimation process. Based on the annual data covering the period of 1980-2014, excluding Russia due to data unavailability, empirical results show that the EKC hypothesis is not valid, and energy intensity and energy structure are important determinants of environmental degradation. In line with the empirical outputs, possible policy suggestions are discussed in the present study. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."
1065,Triacrylamide-Based Adhesives Stabilize Bonds in Physiologic Conditions,"F S de Lucena,S H Lewis,A P P Fugolin,A Y Furuse,J L Ferracane,C S Pfeifer,F S de Lucena,S H Lewis,A P P Fugolin,A Y Furuse,J L Ferracane,C S Pfeifer","In this study, an acrylamide-based adhesive was combined with a thiourethane-based composite to improve bond stability and reduce polymerization stress, respectively, of simulated composite restorations. The stability testing was conducted under physiologic conditions, combining mechanical and bacterial challenges. Urethane dimethacrylate was combined with a newly synthesized triacrylamide (TMAAEA) or HEMA (2-hydroxyethyl-methacrylate; control) to produce a 2-step total-etch adhesive system. Methacrylate-based composites (70 wt% silanized filler) were formulated, containing thiourethane oligomers at 0 (control) or 20 wt%. Standardized preparations in human third molars were restored; then, epoxy replicas were obtained from the occlusal surfaces before and after 7-d storage in water or with Streptococcus mutans biofilm, which was tested after storage in an incubator (static) or the bioreactor (mechanical challenge). Images were obtained from the replicas (scanning electron microscopy) and cross sections of the samples (confocal laser scanning microscopy) and then analyzed to obtain measurements of gap, bacterial infiltration, and demineralization. Microtensile bond strength of specimens stored in water or biofilm was assessed in 1-mm2 stick specimens. Data were analyzed with analysis of variance and Tukey's test (α = 0.05). HEMA-based materials had greater initial gap measurements, indicating more efficient bonding for the acrylamide materials. When tested in water, the triacrylamide-based adhesive had smaller gaps in the incubator or bioreactor. In the presence of biofilm, there was less difference among materials, but the acrylamide/thiourethane combination led to statistically lower gap formation in the bioreactor. HEMA and TMAAEA-based adhesives produced statistically similar microtensile bond strengths after being stored in water for 7 d, but after the same period with biofilm-challenged specimens, the TMAAEA-based adhesives were the only ones to retain the initial bond strength values. The use of a stable multiacrylamide-based adhesive led to the preservation of the resin-dentin bonded interface after a physiologically relevant challenge. Future studies will include a multispecies biofilm model."
1066,The consistency and reliability of six-strand and four-strand flexor tendon repairs: a comparative porcine cadaveric study,"Jaakko A E Kuronen,Benjamin Riski,Olli V Leppänen,Teemu Karjalainen,Lasse Linnanmäki,Jaakko A E Kuronen,Benjamin Riski,Olli V Leppänen,Teemu Karjalainen,Lasse Linnanmäki","The aim of this study was to compare the consistency and reliability of the six-strand Gan modification of the Lim-Tsai flexor tendon repair with the four-strand Adelaide repair, both with 3-0 sutures and with eight to ten runs of simple 5-0 running peripheral suture as well as the influence of the surgeons' level of experience on the strength of the repair in a cadaveric animal setup. Thirty-nine surgeons repaired 78 porcine flexor digitorum profundus tendons with either the Adelaide technique (39 tendons) or the modified Lim-Tsai technique (39 tendons). Each repaired tendon was tested in a material testing machine under a single cycle load-to-failure test. The forces were recorded when the gap between the two tendon stumps reached 1 and 2 mm and when irreversible elongation or total rupture occurred. We found no significant differences in gap formation force and yielding strength of the tendons between the two methods. The surgeon's previous experience in tendon repairs did not improve the consistency, reliability or tensile strength of the repairs. We conclude that if a strong peripheral suture is added, the modified Lim-Tsai repair has the same technical reliability and consistency as the Adelaide repair in term of ultimate loading strength in this test setup."
1067,Some Interval-Valued Intuitionistic Fuzzy Dombi Heronian Mean Operators and their Application for Evaluating the Ecological Value of Forest Ecological Tourism Demonstration Areas,"Wu, Liangping; Wei, Guiwu; Wu, Jiang; Wei, Cun","With China's sustained economic development and constant increase in national income, Chinese nationals' tourism consumption rate increases. As a major Chinese economic development engine, the domestic tourism industry has entered a transition period operation pattern featured by diversified products. Among them, as a new hot spot of the tourism industry in China, ecological tourism has enjoyed rapid development, with great potential. Thus, the ecological value evaluation of forest ecological tourism demonstration areas is very important to the domestic tourism industry. In this paper, we propose some Dombi Heronian mean operators with interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy numbers (IVIFNs). Then, two MADM (multiple attribute decision making) methods are proposed based on IVIFWDHM (interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy weighted Dombi Heronian mean) and IVIFWDGHM (interval-valued intuitionistic weighted Dombi geometric Heronian mean) operators. Finally, we gave an experimental case for evaluating the ecological value of forest ecological tourism demonstration area to show the proposed decision methods."
1068,Marein Prevented LPS-Induced Osteoclastogenesis by Regulating the NF-κB Pathway In Vitro,"Yuling Li,Jing Zhang,Caiping Yan,Qian Chen,Chao Xiang,Qingyan Zhang,Xingkuan Wang,Ke Jiang,Yuling Li,Jing Zhang,Caiping Yan,Qian Chen,Chao Xiang,Qingyan Zhang,Xingkuan Wang,Ke Jiang","Many bone diseases such as osteolysis, osteomyelitis, and septic arthritis are caused by gram-negative bacterial infection, and lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a bacterial product, plays an essential role in this process. Drugs that inhibit LPS-induced osteoclastogenesis are urgently needed to prevent bone destruction in infective bone diseases. Marein, a major bioactive compound of Coreopsis tinctoria, possesses anti-oxidative, anti-inflammatory, anti-hypertensive, anti-hyperlipidemic, and anti-diabetic effects. In this study, we measured the effect of marein on RAW264.7 cells by CCK-8 assay and used TRAP staining to determine osteoclastogenesis. The levels of osteoclast-related genes and NF-κB-related proteins were then analyzed by western blot, and the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines were quantified by ELISA. Our results showed that marein inhibited LPS-induced osteoclast formation by osteoclast precursor RAW264.7 cells. The effect of marein was related to its inhibitory function on expressions of pro-inflammatory cytokines and osteoclast-related genes containing RANK, TRAF6, MMP-9, CK, and CAII. Additionally, marein leads to markedly inhibited NF-κB signaling pathway activation in LPS-induced RAW264.7 cells. Concurrently, when the NF-κB signaling pathway was inhibited, osteoclast formation and pro-inflammatory cytokine expression were decreased. Collectively, marein could inhibit LPS-induced osteoclast formation in RAW264.7 cells via regulating the NF-κB signaling pathway. Our data demonstrate that marein might be a potential drug for bacteria-induced bone destruction disease. Our findings provide new insights into LPS-induced bone disease."

The Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei Urban Agglomeration, also known as the Jing-Jin-Ji Urban Agglomeration (hereafter, JJJUA), with a precarious balance between protecting the ecological environment and sustaining economic development, is challenged by high levels of ozone pollution. Based on ozone observation data from 13 cities in the JJJUA from 2014 to 2017, the spatio-temporal trends in the evolution of ozone pollution and its associated influencing factors were analyzed using Moran's I Index, hot-spot analysis, and Geodetector using ArcGIS and SPSS software. Five key results were obtained. 1) There was an increase in the annual average ozone concentration, for the period 2014-2017. Comparing the 13 prefecture-level cities, ozone pollution in Chengde and Hengshui decreased, while it worsened in the remaining 11 cities. 2) Ozone pollution was worse in spring and summer than in autumn and winter; the peak ozone pollution season was from May to September; the average ozone concentration on workdays was higher than that on non-workdays, showing a counter-weekend effect. 3) Annual average concentrations were high in the central and southern parts of the study region but low in the north. 4) Prominent positive spatial correlations were observed in ozone concentration, with the best correlations shown in summer and autumn; concentrations were high in Baoding and Xingtai but low in Beijing and Chengde. 5) Concentrations of PM10, NO2, CO, SO2, and PM2.5, as well as average wind speed, sunshine duration, evaporation, precipitation, and temperature, all had significant effects on ozone pollution, and interactions between these influencing factors increased it.

Phosphorus (P) and Nitrogen (N) are the major requirements of rice; although these are available in limited concentrations within rice growing regions. Among different types of Plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR), Phosphate solubilizing rhizobacteria (PSRB) constitute an important class. These are known for plant growth promotion by enhancing P and N uptake. PSRB are nowadays used as biofertilizers to restore the soil health. Under the present investigation identification, characterization and optimization of phosphate solubilizing activity of these microbes at different pH, temperature and salt concentrations was carried out. Thirty-seven isolates were recovered from different regions of rice rhizosphere on Pikovskaya (PVK) agar among which 15 isolates were recovered from R.S. Pura, 12 isolates from Bishnah and 10 isolates were recovered from Akhnoor sector of Jammu, India. A prominent halo zone of clearance was developed around the colonies of 12 different isolates, indicating phosphate solubilization activity. Four distinct isolates were amplified, cloned and sequenced for taxonomic identification using 16S primers. The results indicated that PS 1, PS 2, PS 3, PS 4 were related to Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacillus subtilis strain 1, B. subtilis strain 2, B. subtilis strain 3, respectively. These strains when grown at a wide range of ecological factors showed maximum growth at pH between 6.8 and 8.8, temperature between 28 °C and 37 °C and salinity between 1% and 2%. Screening for phosphate solubilization activity revealed that the halo zone diameter formed by these isolates extended from 2.1 to 3.2 mm. The phosphate solubilizing efficiency (SE) ranged from 35.4 to 50.9 with highest value of 50.9 by PS4 and maximum P solubilization of 10.22 µg/ml was recorded by PS4 at 7th day. Phosphate solubilization activity of these identified PSRB strains can be utilized and explored in the rice growing belts of Jammu region which are deficient in phosphorus. MIC value for zinc sulphate heptahydrate in 12 isolates varied from 1 mg/ml to 6 mg/ml. Phosphate solubilization activity and MIC of these identified PSRB strains can be utilized and explored in the rice growing belts of Jammu region which are deficient in phosphorus."

The current study attempted to empirically test the economic and energy usage (renewable and non-renewable) impact on some selected countries of belt and road projects. For this purpose, the panel data set of twenty-four emerging economies of belt and road projects was selected from 1995 to 2014. The autoregressive distributed lags technique of econometric applied to determine the effect of renewable and non-renewable energy, GDP and GDP(2)for EKC, and gross fixed capital formation on carbon emission in the selected countries of Belt and Road Initiative project. The outcomes of this study confirm the existence of EKC in these underlined countries. Here, fossil fuel-based energy consumption is a source of environmental degradation, while renewable and clean energy usage can help sustain environmental conditions without affecting economic growth progress. Capital fixed formation in these economies can enhance economic growth and help to sustainable environmental conditions in the belt and road countries. Thus, based on these empirical outcomes, this study suggests economic and financial assistance in green renewable energy sources and clean technological innovation to enhance economic benefits of Belt and Road Initiative project without compromising the environmental conditions of the region."
1072,Macroeconomic modelling under energy constraints: Global low carbon transition scenarios,"Nieto, Jaime; Carpintero, Oscar; Miguel, Luis J.; de Blas, Ignacio","Integrated Assessment Models provide a framework to study sustainability transitions and their economic impacts. Models seldom consider energy constraints, taking supply availability for granted and thus suggesting a mere change in the energy mix from non-renewables to renewables. In order to address these limitations, a macro-economic module within a broader system dynamics model (MEDEAS) has been developed. The model has been run for the whole world from 1995 to 2050 under three different scenarios: Business as Usual (BAU), considering no further transition policies and keeping current trends; Green Growth (GG), undertaking the low-carbon transition according to the Paris Agreement set of policies and with high GDP growth standards; and Post-Growth (PG), testing the sustainability transition under a GDP non-growth/degrowth approach. The results reveal the conflict between economic growth, climate policy and the sustainability of resources. Whereas a BAU approach would not even be an option to achieve climate goals, a GG view would not only face the downsizing of economic output, but neither would it be able to achieve the 2 degrees C objective. The success of the PG approach in meeting emissions objectives suggests a redirection from economic growth policies to an industrial policy that incorporates efficiency and redistribution."

After 4 sessions of transarterial bland particle and ethanol embolization, the resultant increased ossification of the tumor allowed preservation of the articular surface during surgical resection. Imaging follow-up 14 months after surgical resection showed no evidence of recurrence and continued ossification of the portions of the lesion treated only with embolization."

Females born term and singleton in Sweden between 1973 and 1995 (N = 305,893) were studied at their first pregnancy. Information regarding their birthweight, early pregnancy body mass index, and pregnancy complications was retrieved from the Swedish Medical Birth Register, as were data on their mothers and offspring. High maternal birthweights (2-3 standard deviation scores (SDS) and >3 SDS) were associated with greater odds of early pregnancy obesity, odds ratio (OR) 1.52 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.42-1.63) and OR 2.06 (CI 1.71-2.49), respectively. A low maternal birthweight (<2 SDS) was associated with greater odds of GDM (OR 2.49, CI 2.00-3.12). No association was found between high maternal birthweight and GDM. A maternal birthweight 2-3 SDS was associated with offspring birthweight 2-3 SDS (OR 3.83, CI 3.44-4.26), and >3 SDS (OR 3.55, CI 2.54-4.97). Corresponding ORs for a maternal birthweight >3 SDS were 5.38 (CI 4.12-7.01) and 6.98 (CI 3.57-13.65), respectively. In conclusion, a high maternal birthweight was positively associated with early pregnancy obesity and offspring macrosomia. A low, but not a high maternal birthweight, was associated with GDM."
1075,Technique of Augmenting Molecular Graph Data by Perturbating Hidden Features,"Takahiro Inoue,Kenichi Tanaka,Kimito Funatsu,Takahiro Inoue,Kenichi Tanaka,Kimito Funatsu","Quantitative structure-property relationship models are useful in efficiently searching for molecules with desired properties in drug discovery and materials development. In recent years, many such models based on graph neural networks, showing good prediction performance, have been reported. Training graph neural networks generally require many samples, but by using a training method for a small dataset, it is possible to extract features that enable successful prediction. Herein, we design a method of augmenting graph data. In this method, random perturbations are added with a certain probability to some vertex features during message passing. We verify the proposed method's effectiveness in regression and classification tasks. It is confirmed that the proposed method is effective when the perturbation is added immediately before the readout of the graph neural network, and the effect of the data augmentation is most evident for small datasets of approximately 1000 samples."
1076,Real-time video and force analysis feedback system for learning strength skills on rings in men's artistic gymnastics,"Toshiyuki Fujihara,Toshiyuki Fujihara","The importance of objective evaluations has gathered more attention than before for a fairer and better performance judgment in gymnastics. The purpose of this report was to disseminate information about our system and provide an example of data utilisation in high-level competitive training from a practical standpoint. The system combined video and force data, measured with two force transducers at the top of the ring cables, wirelessly transmitted to a computer. The force data synchronised with the video were available in real time or immediately after trials, making it possible to objectively quantify the amount of spotting that a gymnast received as external physical assistances. The simplicity of the setup and several special functions of the system led athletes and coaches spontaneously to use it in their regular training to quantify their skill level. Based on the regular utilisation of the system, the general correspondence between objectively measured values and the subjective perception of spotters was determined. In addition, the data suggested the possibility of technical evaluation of a certain type of strength skill based on force data. The data that are shared in this report should be beneficial in facilitating activities to integrate science into practice in gymnastics."
1077,Economic dispatching strategy of distributed energy storage for deferring substation expansion in the distribution network with distributed generation and electric vehicle,"Li, Cuiping; Zhou, Hengyu; Li, Junhui; Dong, Zhemin","Aiming at the problem that the traditional substation expansion method leads to low availability of transformers and distributed generations (DG), and considering the improvement of energy storage operation revenue to reduce the energy storage investment cost, an energy storage economic dispatch strategy for deferring substation expansion is proposed. The strategy takes the charge-discharge balance as the criterion, considers the system security constraints and energy storage operation constraints, and aims at maximizing the comprehensive income of system loss and arbitrage from energy storage operation, and establishes the economic operation model of energy storage, the energy storage power is calculated according to different peak-cutting values, and the operating income of corresponding energy storage power is calculated by substituting it into the economic operation model. Finally, the energy storage power corresponding to the optimal income is determined. Through the simulation and analysis of the IEEE33 bus distribution system, based on the proposed evaluation index, the results show that the economic dispatching strategy proposed in this paper can greatly increase the operating income of energy storage, reduce the equivalent annual investment cost of energy storage equipment by $54,930 compared with the substation expansion scheme, and increase the annual availability rate of transformers to 32.8%, the annual availability hours of distributed generations increased by 267 h.

Bipolar-stacked electrode coupling with solid-state electrolytes enables achieving batteries with high output voltage, high energy density, and simple components. Here, a polymer electrolyte membrane is designed with polyethylene oxide containing bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)-imide as the electrolyte, succinonitrile as the plasticizer, and nylon mesh as a reinforcement for the bipolar-stacked battery. The as-prepared nylon mesh-reinforced polymer electrolyte membrane shows advantageous features, that is, excellent ionic conductivity (3.38 × 10-4 S cm-1) at room temperature, low interface impedance, and good tolerance against the expansion caused by the plating/stripping of the Li anode and the electrode upon cycling. When used as a polymer electrolyte membrane in the bipolar-stacked battery, the LiFePO4(LFP)-Li4Ti5O12(LTO) cell with three cells connected in series delivers a higher discharge voltage (5.4 V) and a volumetric energy density (0.328 mW h cm-3), nearly 3 times as much as that of the LFP-LTO battery. In addition, LiFePO4-Li pouch cells using the polymer electrolyte membrane can sustain the abuse tests including bending, cutting, and nail penetration well. These results pave a new avenue to develop high-performance polymer electrolyte membranes and allow for the design of high-voltage and volumetric energy density bipolar-stacked batteries."

In this case report, we described a patient with isolated abducens nerve palsy after COVID-19. The patient was a healthy 28-year-old man who developed isolated abducens nerve palsy 10 days after COVID-19. He had no systemic risk factors. He had 20 PD left esotropia (ET) at distance and 16 PD left ET at near in primary position and ET increasing to 25 PD in left gaze. He had left abduction deficiency. His cranio-orbital magnetic resonance imaging findings were normal. He was diagnosed as left isolated abducens nerve palsy and his findings were recovered after 2 months. COVID-19 may cause ocular motor nerve palsies. Although the pathological mechanism remains unclear, direct viral invasion, inflammatory and immune mechanisms may play role. Further case reports and studies are needed to support these findings."
1080,The role of financial development and globalization in the environment: Accounting ecological footprint indicators for selected one-belt-one-road initiative countries,"Saud, Shah; Chen, Songsheng; Haseeb, Abdul; Sumayya","The pressure of globalization on our ecosystem is widely debated, and academics and researchers urge clear policies at all levels. In this regard, a plethora of research work use carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions as an indicator of environmental measure to show that both globalization and financial development have diverse impacts on the environment. In fact, CO2 emissions are only a portion of total greenhouse gas emissions, so a comprehensive measure is required to gauge total ecological deterioration. The ecological footprint (EF) indicator is a comprehensive environmental accounting tool that has streamlined input-output environmental assessments. This study investigates the role of financial development and globalization on the EF for selected one-belt-one-road initiative countries from 1990 to 2014. The pooled means group long-run panel estimations results show that the EF sparks off by 0.0211 percent global hectares (gha) in selected panel countries when there is a 1 percent rise in financial development. A 1 percent growth in globalization mitigates the EF by 0.0038 percent gha in the long-run, suggesting an inverse relationship. Moreover, the country-specific findings show that the EF increases (at various percentages in gha) due to upsurges in both financial development and globalization in thirty- and twenty-nine countries, respectively. However, the EF declines (at various percentages in gha) due to increase in financial development in fourteen countries and globalization in four countries. In addition, the pairwise Granger causality finding shows the feedback effects of both financial development and globalization on EF. The EF affects environmental degradation, so efforts to reduce ecological deterioration and even immediate intervention measures should be employed in support of a sustainable environment.

1081,Analyzing carbon emission transfer network structure among provinces in China: new evidence from social network analysis,"Sun, Licheng; Qin, Lin; Taghizadeh-Hesary, Farhad; Zhang, Jijian; Mohsin, Muhammad; Chaudhry, Imran Sharif","Domestic trade plays a key role in China's rapid economic progress. However, the increased domestic trade causes significant variations in carbon emission transfer among provinces. This study adopted the multi-region input-output (MRIO) model and social network analysis (SNA) to estimate the carbon emission transfer. Furthermore, the carbon emission transfer network characteristics among 30 provinces and 27 sectors were analyzed by using interprovincial input-output tables for 2007, 2010, and 2012. The results showed that (1) Large differences exist in carbon emission transfer flow and its network characteristics between provinces. (2) The three industrial sectors of metal smelting and pressing sector, power, heat production, and supply sector, petroleum processing, coking, and nuclear fuel processing sector have high carbon emission transfer and pose a strong influence on the carbon emission transfer network. (3) Provinces of the eastern region have a ""bidirectional spillover"" role, while those of the western region have a mediating role as an ""agent."" Provinces of the central region have a ""main inflow"" role. Finally, useful policy implications and suggestions of this study are summarized."
1082,Intensification of a new electrocoagulation system characterized by minimum energy consumption and maximum removal efficiency of heavy metals from simulated wastewater,"El-Ashtoukhy, E-S Z.; Amin, N. K.; Fouad, Y. O.; Hamad, H. A.","In the present study, a new simple self-gas stirred batch electrocoagulation reactor was designed. The new cell consisted of a cylindrical Al sheet anode and a cylindrical Al screen cathode placed at a small distance from the anode. The H-2 evolving screen cathode improves the mixing conditions in the cell via turblence promotion and solution recycling which improves the economic efficiency of the electrochemical cell. This favourable hydrodynamic conditions improved considerably the % removal of Ni2+ and Cu2+ ions from a synthetic wastewater. The removal efficiency and apparent removal rate constant (k(app)) of Cu2+ were higher than those of Ni2+ as a result of the additional cathodic deposition mechanism. Energy consumption ranged from 4.43-75.71 kW.h/kg depending on the operating conditions. The optimal operational conditions,were current density (c.d) of 1.72 mAcm(-2), initial metal concentration (C-o) of 100 mg.L-1, NaCl concentration (C-N) of 1 g.L-1 and pH (5.5 for Cu and 4 for Ni) at 40 min. of electrolysis. The % removal efficiency ranged from 34.56-100% depending on the operating conditions. This study revealed that the new self stirred cell has the potential to be used for the removal of heavy metal from contaminated water."
1083,Modelling the global impact of China's ban on plastic waste imports,"Huang, Qiao; Chen, Guangwu; Wang, Yafei; Chen, Shaoqing; Xu, Lixiao; Wang, Rui","China has long been the world's leading plastic waste importer. However, in January 2018 the Chinese Government enacted a new policy to permanently ban the import of most plastic waste into the country. This raises an important question: what will the impact of this policy be both domestically and globally? It is argued that the answer to this question can in part be systematically revealed by employing three methods of analysis. (1) A combined multiregional input-output model with structural path analysis (SPA) to understand how consumption patterns domestically and globally drive China's plastic waste imports. (2) An ecological network analysis to identify which region is the dominant controller of the global plastic waste trade network. Lastly, (3) a hypothetical extraction method to investigate the value-added change for China and the increased requirement of waste treatment capacity for other economies. The results indicate that the imported plastic waste was mainly driven by China's domestic consumption of products containing recycled plastic. Given this demand, it is recommended that the Chinese Government undertake various actions to increase local plastic waste recycling to compensate for the loss of recycled plastic material since the import ban took place. China is a dominant controller, along with the US, the European Union and Germany of the global plastic waste trade network. At this stage it is not possible for other large economies to replace the role of China in the short term. China's waste import ban caused a minor economic loss for China, however, it has resulted in the need for other economies to increase their waste treatment capacity. As well as increasing local plastic waste recycling, it is recommended the Chinese Government consider reopening imports for high quality recycled material and to seek global collaboration, which would not only ease the shortage of recycled plastic material but also buy time for other economies to build new waste treatment plants."

1085,"New optimal design for a hybrid solar chimney, solid oxide electrolysis and fuel cell based on improved deer hunting optimization algorithm","Tian, Man-Wen; Yan, Shu-Rong; Han, Shi-Zhuan; Nojavan, Sayyad; Jermsittiparsert, Kittisak; Razmjooy, Navid","In recent years, renewable energy resources such as wind and solar energy have been considered as the main alternative to fossil fuels due to their benefits such as economic benefits, low environmental pollution, and renewable power generation. The solar chimney is one of these alternatives with a simple structure that can be adopted for generating easy and clean energy. The application of solar chimney in desert areas of the Yazd city with high-intensity solar radiation is efficient and environmentally friendly. Due to the low efficiency of the solar chimney in the night times, a combined configuration has been proposed by considering the solid oxide fuel cell and solid oxide electrolysis cell for storing the surplus energy as Hydrogen for the night times. The paper also presents a developed version of deer hunting optimization algorithm to optimal designing of the economic aspect of the power plant. Simulation results are applied to two different seasons for more analysis and the results of the optimal system are compared with genetic algorithm (GA) and particle swarm optimization algorithm (PSO) to show the system efficiency. The results showed that 0.16 kg/s hydrogen is produced at the peak of the radiation in a district of Yazd city. The results also show the decreasing the loss value based on optimal economical designing gives 1,192,000,000$, 1,190,000,000$, and 8,645,000,000$ cost for the GA and PSO, and the proposed improved deer hunting optimization algorithm, respectively. It also shows that the energy generated by the presented configuration in the summer is higher than the winter. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."
1086,Reinvestigating the pollution haven hypothesis: the nexus between foreign direct investments and environmental quality in G-20 countries,"Mohammed Musah,Isaac Adjei Mensah,Morrison Alfred,Haider Mahmood,Muntasir Murshed,Akoto Yaw Omari-Sasu,Frank Boateng,Joseph Dery Nyeadi,Cephas Paa Kwesi Coffie,Mohammed Musah,Isaac Adjei Mensah,Morrison Alfred,Haider Mahmood,Muntasir Murshed,Akoto Yaw Omari-Sasu,Frank Boateng,Joseph Dery Nyeadi,Cephas Paa Kwesi Coffie","One of the most commonly debated concerns regarding foreign direct investment inflows is the associated environmental adversities that accompany the influx of foreign funds. As a result, assessing the environmental impacts of foreign direct investment inflows is necessary for achieving environmentally friendly economic growth in the contemporary era. Accordingly, the global economies including the members of the Group of Twenty (G-20) should focus on attracting clean foreign direct investments. Against this backdrop, controlling for energy consumption and urbanization, this extant study scrutinizes the effects of foreign direct investment inflows on the carbon dioxide emission figures of selected G-20 countries between 1992 and 2018. The econometric analysis conducted in this paper involves recently developed methods that are efficient in handling cross-sectionally dependent heterogeneous panel data sets. Besides, the analysis is also conducted for sub-panels of high-, upper-middle-, and lower-middle-income G-20 countries to evaluate the possible heterogeneous environmental effects across the G-20 countries belonging to different income levels. Overall, the results highlight that higher foreign direct investment inflows surge carbon dioxide emissions whereby the pollution haven hypothesis is evidenced to hold for the G-20 nations of concern. Similarly, both at the aggregated and disaggregated levels, greater consumption of energy is witnessed to boost carbon dioxide emissions in the long run. Moreover, urbanization is found to trigger carbon dioxide emissions for the G-20 nations overall and the lower-middle-income G-20 nations. Further, the causality analysis reveals that carbon dioxide emissions have bidirectional causal relationships with foreign direct investment inflows, energy consumption, and urbanization. In line with these major findings, this study recommends that the governments of the G-20 countries inhibit inflows of dirty foreign direct investments, reduce fossil fuel dependency, and adopt green urbanization policies for achieving higher economic growth without marginalizing environmental well-being."

The aim of the study was to evaluate the association between vitamin D levels and the risks of SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe disease in those infected. A retrospective study was carried out among members of Clalit Health Services (CHS), the largest healthcare organization in Israel, between March 1 and October 31, 2020. We created two matched case-control groups of individuals for which vitamin D levels and body mass index (BMI) were available before the pandemic: group (A), in which 41,757 individuals with positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR tests were matched with 417,570 control individuals without evidence of infection, and group (B), in which 2533 patients hospitalized in severe condition for COVID-19 were matched with 2533 patients who were tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, but were not hospitalized. Conditional logistic models were fitted in each of the groups to assess the association between vitamin D levels and outcome. An inverse correlation was demonstrated between the level of vitamin D and the risks of SARS-CoV-2 infection and of severe disease in those infected. Patients with very low vitamin D levels (< 30 nmol/L) had the highest risks for SARS-CoV-2 infection and also for severe COVID-19 when infected-OR 1.246 [95% CI 1.210-1.304] and 1.513 [95% CI 1.230-1.861], respectively.

This study was aimed at evaluation of application of ethanolic extract of propolis-loaded poly(-lactic-co-glycolic acid) nanoparticles (EEP-PLGA NPs) on wound healing in diabetic rats. Sixty rats were randomized into four groups of 15 rats each: In control group (Control) diabetic wound was treated with normal saline. In Carrier 1 group diabetic wound was treated with PLGA nanoparticles based solution. In Carrier 2 group the diabetic wound was treated with EEP. In Treatment group animals received EEP-PLGA NPs on the wound. Wound size was measured on 7, 14 and 21 days after surgery. The expression of p53, bcl-2, Caspase III, were evaluated using reverse-transcription PCR and Immunohistochemical staining. The Treatment group had significantly reduced the wound size compared to other groups (P = 0.001). histological and morphometric studies, and mean rank of the qualitative studies demonstrated that there was significant difference between Treatment group and other groups (P < .05). Observations demonstrated that ethanolic extract of propolis-loaded PLGA nanoparticles significantly shortened the inflammatory phase and accelerated the cellular proliferation. Accordingly, the animals in Treatment group revealed significantly (P < .05) higher fibroblast distribution/one mm2 of wound area and rapid re epithelialization. The mRNA levels of bcl-2, p53 and caspase III were remarkably (P < .05) higher in Treatment group compared to control and animals. The immunohistochemical analyzes confirmed the RT-PCR findings. EEP-PLGA NPs offered potential advantages in wound healing acceleration and improvement through angiogenesis stimulation, fibroblast proliferation and granulation tissue formation in early days of healing phases, acceleration in diabetic wound repair associated with earlier wound contraction and stability of damaged area by rearrangement of granulation tissue and collagen fibers."
1089,Archerfish number discrimination,"Davide Potrich,Mirko Zanon,Giorgio Vallortigara,Davide Potrich,Mirko Zanon,Giorgio Vallortigara","Debates have arisen as to whether non-human animals actually can learn abstract non-symbolic numerousness or whether they always rely on some continuous physical aspect of the stimuli, covarying with number. Here, we investigated archerfish (Toxotes jaculatrix) non-symbolic numerical discrimination with accurate control for covarying continuous physical stimulus attributes. Archerfish were trained to select one of two groups of black dots (Exp. 1: 3 vs 6 elements; Exp. 2: 2 vs 3 elements); these were controlled for several combinations of physical variables (elements' size, overall area, overall perimeter, density, and sparsity), ensuring that only numerical information was available. Generalization tests with novel numerical comparisons (2 vs 3, 5 vs 8, and 6 vs 9 in Exp. 1; 3 vs 4, 3 vs 6 in Exp. 2) revealed choice for the largest or smallest numerical group according to the relative number that was rewarded at training. None of the continuous physical variables, including spatial frequency, were affecting archerfish performance. Results provide evidence that archerfish spontaneously use abstract relative numerical information for both small and large numbers when only numerical cues are available."

Personal protection equipment (PPE) and physical barrier are the most widely applied prevention measures in practice due to their affordability and ease of implementation. This study aims to investigate the effect of PPE and physical barriers on mitigating the short-range airborne transmission between two people in a ventilated environment. Four types of PPE (surgical mask, two types of face shield, and mouth visor), and two different sizes of the physical barrier were tested in a controlled environment with two life-size breathing thermal manikins. The PPE was worn by the source manikin to test the efficiency of source control. The measurement results revealed that the principles of PPE on preventing short-range droplet and airborne transmission are different. Instead of filtering the fine droplet nuclei, they mainly redirect the virus-laden exhalation jet and avoid the exhaled flow entering the target's inhalation region. Physical barriers can block the spreading of droplet nuclei and create a good micro environment at short distances between persons. However, special attention should be paid to arranging the physical barrier and operating the ventilation system to avoid the stagnant zone where the contaminant accumulates."

In recent years, very high resolution (VHR) remote sensing imagery interpretation has resolved the ""semantic gap"" between the low-level data and the high-level semantic scenes, and has been used to map urban land use. Nevertheless, the existing frameworks cannot easily be applied to practical urban analysis, which can be attributed to three main reasons: 1) the indistinguishable socio-economic attributes of the same ground object layouts; 2) the weak transferability of the supervised frameworks and the time-consuming training sample annotation; and 3) the category system inconsistency between the data source and the urban land-use application. In this paper, to achieve an ""application gap"" breakthrough for urban land-use mapping, a data-driven point, line, and polygon semantic object mapping (PLPSOM) framework is proposed, which makes full use of open-source VHR images and multi-source geospatial data. In the PLPSOM framework, point, line, and polygon semantic objects are represented by the points of interest (POIs), OpenStreetMap (OSM) data, and VHR images corresponding to the scenes in the land-use mapping units, respectively. OSM line semantic objects are utilized to supply the boundaries of the land-use mapping units for the POIs and VHR images, forming urban land parcels (street blocks). To reduce the cost of the data annotation, the training dataset is constructed using multiple open-source data sources. An enhanced deep adaptation network (EDAN) is then proposed to acquire the categories of the VHR scene images in the case of partial transfer learning. Finally, in order to meet the actual needs, a rule-based category mapping (RCM) model is applied to integrate the categories of the POIs and VHR images into the urban land-use category system, allowing us to acquire the land-use maps of the cities. The effectiveness of the proposed method was tested in four cities of China, including six specific areas: Beijing and Wuhan city centers; the Hanyang District of Wuhan; the Hannan District of Wuhan; Macao; and the Wan Chai area of Hong Kong, achieving a high classification accuracy. The ""urban image"" analysis confirmed the practicality of the obtained urban land-use maps."

This study explored the mosquitocidal activity of the combined extract of seven plants, (HF7) extracted using a Soxhlet extractor against Culex pipiens under laboratory conditions. Exposure of the 3rd instars of Cx. pipiens to HF7 hexane extract resulted in LC50:114.5 μg/mL and LC90:117.0 μg/mL values after 24 h. The ovicidal activities of hexane extract against Cx. pipiens eggs were 21.6%, 48.3%, and 71.6% at 187.5, 93.7, and 46.88 μg/mL, respectively. HF7-treated larvae showed the formation of irregular blebbing of epithelial cells toward the lumen and sloughing into the gut lumen. HF7 extract resulted in 100% adulticidal mortality at the concentration of 3.7 mg/test tube after 30 min of exposure. The IC50 of HF7 extract was 97.03 µg/ml against larvae, at which nuclear and morphological changes were observed. The spectroscopy spectrum of HF7 hexane extract disclosed the presence of 57 different secondary metabolites, among which the dominant compound was eugenol (32.3%). HF7 hexane extract could serve as a botanical insecticide for controlling Cx. pipiens and potentially other mosquito species."

However, the impact of PBMC composition on PBMC metabolism is not yet clear, neither is the differential impact of a longer-term lifestyle factor versus a short-term lifestyle intervention. We investigated the effect of aerobic fitness level and a recent exercise bout on PBMC metabolism in females. PBMCs from 31 young female adults divided into a high-fit (V̇o2peak ≥ 47 mL/kg/min, n = 15) and low-fit (V̇o2peak ≤ 37 mL/kg/min, n = 16) groups were isolated at baseline and overnight after a single bout of exercise (60 min, 70% V̇o2peak). Oxygen consumption rate (OCR) and glycolytic rate (GR) were measured using extracellular flux (XF) assays and PBMC subsets were characterized using fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). Basal OCR, FCCP-induced OCR, spare respiratory capacity, ATP-linked OCR, and proton leak were significantly higher in high-fit than in low-fit females (all P < 0.01), whereas no significant differences in glycolytic rate (GR) were found (all P > 0.05). A recent exercise bout did not significantly affect GR or OCR parameters (all P > 0.05). The overall PBMC composition was similar between high-fit and low-fit females. Mitochondrial PBMC function was significantly higher in PBMCs from high-fit than from low-fit females, which was unrelated to PBMC composition and not impacted by a recent bout of exercise. Our study reveals a link between PBMC metabolism and levels of aerobic fitness, increasing the relevance of PBMC metabolism as a marker to study the impact of lifestyle factors on human health.NEW & NOTEWORTHY Mitochondrial metabolism was significantly higher in PBMCs from high-fit than from low-fit females.

This work aims to bridge the lack of this type of investigations providing a worldwide techno-economic mapping and optimization of SA and GC PV-wind HRES to supply the electrical demand of an office building district. For this purpose, energy and economic optimization problems were formulated to find the optimal SA and GC systems worldwide among 343 HRES system power configurations located in 48 different localities, uniformly divided in the sub-group of the Koppen classification. The energy reliability and economic profitability of optimal systems were geographically mapped worldwide. In general, the energy or economic optimizations of SA HRES do not lead to highly profitable systems; instead, feed-in-tariff to sell the energy in excess assures viable GC HRES in many localities. However, economically optimal SA and GC HRES, respectively, do not everywhere comply with the threshold value of 70% of the satisfied energy required by the load and are characterized by a high level of energy exchanged with the grid. The study highlighted that the most suitable climate conditions to install a SA HRES are: (i) Toamasina (Madagascar) from an energy point of view, with 76% of load satisfied and 76% of the energy generated utilized [GRAPHICS] to supply the load; (ii) Cambridge Bay (Canada) from an economic point of view, with 11.1% of the capital cost recovered each year; instead, the most suitable climate conditions to install a GC HRES are: (iii) New Delhi (India) from an energy point of view, with 48% of energy exchanged with the grid per each kWh required by the load; (iv) Lihue (Hawaii, United States) from an economic point of view, with 24.3% of the capital cost recovered each year."

Like other agrochemicals, imazethapyr is commercialized in formulations containing a mixture of additives that increase the effectiveness of the active ingredient. These complex mixtures may cause adverse effects on non-target primary producers, such as microalgae, when they reach freshwater bodies. The aim of this study was to assess the effects, separately, of the formulation Verosil®, the formulation additives, and technical-grade imazethapyr, in the acidic form or as ammonium salt, on the microalga Scenedesmus vacuolatus (Chlorophyta). Verosil®, formulation additives, and acid imazethapyr significantly inhibited the growth of S. vacuolatus (Verosil® > formulation additives > acid imazethapyr) and caused morphological alterations from 2 mg L-1, 4 mg L-1, and 60 mg L-1 onwards, respectively. Verosil® and formulation additives caused the most adverse effect including membrane disorganization, cytoplasm contraction, cell wall thickening, thylakoidal membrane disaggregation, and starch granule accumulation. In addition, Verosil® and formulation additives increased the chl a/chl b ratio, indicating possible alterations in photosystems as a stress response. The carotene/chl a ratio was also increased in microalgae exposed to both Verosil® and formulation additives, suggesting an antioxidant response to these toxic compounds. All these results support the hypothesis that the formulation additives contribute significantly to the toxicity and alterations caused by the commercial formulation Verosil® on S. vacuolatus."
1096,Renewable energy consumption and economic growth nexus: Evidence from a threshold model,"Chen, Chaoyi; Pinar, Mehmet; Stengos, Thanasis","The existing literature on renewable energy consumption and economic growth nexus produces mixed results as the effect of renewable energy consumption on economic growth can be either positive, negative or not significant. This paper examines the causal link between renewable energy use and economic growth by employing a threshold model using a 103-country sample in the 1995 to 2015 period. We find that the relationship between renewable energy consumption and economic growth depends on the amount of renewable energy used. Our results demonstrate that the effect of renewable energy consumption on economic growth is positive and significant if and only if developing countries or non-OECD countries surpass a certain threshold of renewable energy consumption. However, if developing countries use renewable energy below a given threshold level, the effect of renewable energy consumption on economic growth is negative. However, we also find that renewable energy consumption has no significant effect on economic growth in developed countries and a positive and significant effect on economic growth in OECD countries. The findings of this paper suggest that for developing countries to realize positive economic growth from their investment to renewable energy, they need to surpass a certain threshold of renewable energy consumption."
1097,Management of chicken manure using black soldier fly (Diptera: Stratiomyidae) larvae assisted by companion bacteria,"Mazza, Lorenzo; Xiao, Xiaopeng; Rehman, Kashif Ur; Cai, Minmin; Zhang, Dingnan; Fasulo, Salvatore; Tomberlin, Jeffery K.; Zheng, Longyu; Soomro, Abdul Aziz; Yu, Ziniu; Zhang, Jibin","Black soldier fly (BSF) is used for the management of organic waste, but research has hardly explored the effect of companion bacteria when chicken manure (CHM) is converted to insect biomass. In this study, we isolated nine bacterial species (FE01, FE02, FE03, FE04, FE05, FE06, FE07, FE08, FE09) from BSF eggs and one (BSF-CL) from the larval gut. These companion bacteria were inoculated into CHM along with BSF larvae (BSFL). Larval growth and manure conversion rates were determined. Results indicated that almost all bacteria individual bacteria in this study significantly promote BSFL growth. BSFL reared in manure with the species Kocuria marina (FE01), Lysinibacillus boronitolerans (FE04), Proteus mirabilis (FE08) and Bacillus subtilis (BSF-CL) had higher weight gain and manure reduction rates compared to the control. These four strains used were then examined as a poly-bacteria community experiment to determine BSFL growth and manure conversion. Manure inoculated with the poly-bacteria Group3 (FE01:FE04:FE08:BSF-CL = 4:1:1:1) and then fed to BSFL resulted in 28.6% more weight gain than the control. The greatest manure reduction rate (52.91%) was reached when companion bacteria were mixed at a ratio of 1:1:1:4. Additionally, the companion bacteria influenced the nutritional value of BSFL. Crude protein content in Groupl (FE01:FE04:FE08:BSF-CL = 1:1:1:1) was significantly larger than that of the control. Crude fat content in Group3 was significantly larger than that of the control. BSFL companion bacteria and their poly-bacteria compound improved manure conversion efficiency and nutrient accumulation in BSFL, reduced CHM quantity, increased larvae biomass, with potential economic gains in CHM management.

1098,Assessing the Potentials of Digitalization as a Tool for Climate Change Adaptation and Sustainable Development in Urban Centres,"Balogun, Abdul-Lateef; Marks, Danny; Sharma, Richa; Shekhar, Himanshu; Balmes, Chiden; Maheng, Dikman; Arshad, Adnan; Salehi, Pourya","Digitalization is a key enabler of sustainable development of cities' socio-economic dynamics with the potential to foster climate-friendly urban environments and societies. The advent of the 4th industrial revolution has seen the increased application of digitalization in several fields and at different levels. High-tech digital devices, platforms and environments are increasingly being deployed to enhance productivity, efficiency and sustainability, and improve overall well-being of urban dwellers. Digitalization is projected to further impact cities in future, transform jobs and trigger life-style changes with far-reaching impacts that will ultimately affect cities' resilience and adaptation capacities. While a growing body of research has highlighted the significance of digitalization to climate change mitigation such as reducing GHG and CO2 emissions, comprehensive evaluations of the potentials of digitalization as an enabler of climate change adaptation remain scarce. This paper addresses this gap by analysing the current trend in digital revolution in relation to climate change adaptation and examines the likely challenges of digitalization. A desk research method was adopted, focusing on core digitalization concepts driving the Fourth Industrial Revolution (IR 4.0). Nine case studies in cities across various continents were selected to assess the potentials of digitalization in addressing climatic hazards and to highlight benefits from implementing digitalization, while considering the social-ecological-technological challenges and tensions around IR 4.0. Our findings reveal the capabilities of digitalization in supporting more effective early warning and emergency response systems, enhancing food and water security, improving power infrastructure performance, enabling citizen engagement and participatory adaptation measures and minimizing the impacts of climatic hazards. Finally, we recommend feasible pathways to overcome present risks and challenges in order to optimize the numerous opportunities offered by digitalization in support of climate change adaptation initiatives."
1099,Systematic review and meta-analysis of the inter-recti distance on ultrasound measurement in nulliparas,"Yue Wang,Huifang Wang,Yue Wang,Huifang Wang","The objective is to evaluate the inter-recti distance on ultrasound measurement at different locations in healthy nulliparas. Electronic databases were searched for studies describing the inter-recti distance measured by ultrasound in healthy nulliparas. We excluded studies without descriptions of the measurement position or the condition of the abdominal wall. A meta-analysis was performed to evaluate the inter-recti distance on ultrasound measurement. Seven eligible studies with 295 healthy nulliparas were included. The location of the inter-recti distance measurement by ultrasound was not uniform. The pooled data divided the measurement locations into three areas. The meta-analytic summary values of the umbilical inter-recti distance of the nulliparas was 8.77 mm (6.56-10.99 mm), the distance at the epigastric area was 7.22 mm (2.76-11.68 mm), and that at the infraumbilical area was 4.09 mm (1.55-6.64 mm). The maximal reported inter-recti distance in healthy nulliparous women is smaller than 10 mm on ultrasound measurement at all locations and the range in the umbilical area is larger than that in the epigastric, infraumbilical areas. The values for the inter-recti distance reported in this systematic review can be used as the reference of feasible and desirable distance of the rectus muscles after rectus fascia plication. The limitation was that the methodological quality of the assessment in most studies was unclear or low."

Nevertheless, most of the state-of-health estimation methods require a large amount of laboratory aging data to offer precise results. As obtaining battery aging data under laboratory conditions requires a considerable amount of time and incurs high economic costs, in this paper, a method based on transfer learning is proposed to monitor state-of-health of batteries. A novel data processing method based on maximum mean discrepancy is considered to eliminate redundant information and minimize the difference between different data distributions. Then, mutual information is used to prove that the correlation between processed data is not decreased. To validate the developed transfer learning method, the data sets of four batteries in different working conditions are considered. Different error-detection methods, maximum average error, mean squared error and root mean squared error, which are utilized to evaluate the proposed model. The state of health is estimated effectively with less than 2.5% error considering the aforementioned errors after processed by using semi-supervised transfer component analysis algorithm, although the training set only accounts for about 35% of the entire set. The results indicate that transfer learning plays an important role in improving the estimation accuracy of a battery state-of-health."
1101,"Spatial Statistics and Influencing Factors of the COVID-19 Epidemic at Both Prefecture and County Levels in Hubei Province, China","Xiong, Yongzhu; Wang, Yunpeng; Chen, Feng; Zhu, Mingyong","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic has had a crucial influence on people's lives and socio-economic development. An understanding of the spatiotemporal patterns and influencing factors of the COVID-19 epidemic on multiple scales could benefit the control of the outbreak. Therefore, we used spatial autocorrelation and Spearman's rank correlation methods to investigate these two topics, respectively. The COVID-19 epidemic data reported publicly and relevant open data in Hubei province were analyzed. The results showed that (1) at both prefecture and county levels, the global spatial autocorrelation was extremely significant for the cumulative confirmed COVID-19 cases (CCC) in Hubei province from 30 January to 18 February 2020. Further, (2) at both levels, the significant hotspots and cluster/outlier areas were observed solely in Wuhan city and most of its districts/sub-cities from 30 January to 18 February 2020. (3) At the prefecture level in Hubei province, the number of CCC had a positive and extremely significant correlation (p < 0.01) with the registered population (RGP), resident population (RSP), Baidu migration index (BMI), regional gross domestic production (GDP), and total retail sales of consumer goods (TRS), respectively, from 29 January to 18 February 2020 and had a negative and significant correlation (p < 0.05) with minimum elevation (MINE) from 2 February to 18 February 2020, but no association with the land area (LA), population density (PD), maximum elevation (MAXE), mean elevation (MNE), and range of elevation (RAE) from 23 January to 18 February 2020. (4) At the county level, the number of CCC in Hubei province had a positive and extremely significant correlation (p < 0.01) with PD, RGP, RSP, GDP, and TRS, respectively, from 27 January to 18 February 2020, and was negatively associated with MINE, MAXE, MNE, and RAE, respectively, from 26 January to 18 February 2020, and negatively associated with LA from 30 January to 18 February 2020. It suggested that (1) the COVID-19 epidemics at both levels in Hubei province had evident characteristics of significant global spatial autocorrelations and significant centralized high-risk outbreaks. (2) The COVID-19 epidemics were significantly associated with the natural factors, such as LA, MAXE, MNE, and RAE, -only at the county level, not at the prefecture level, from 2 February to 18 February 2020. (3) The COVID-19 epidemics were significantly related to the socioeconomic factors, such as RGP, RSP, TRS, and GDP, at both levels from 26 January to 18 February 2020. It is desired that this study enrich our understanding of the spatiotemporal patterns and influencing factors of the COVID-19 epidemic and benefit classified prevention and control of the COVID-19 epidemic for policymakers."
1102,"A novel multi-objective spiral optimization algorithm for an innovative solar/biomass-based multi-generation energy system: 3E analyses, and optimization algorithms comparison","Cao, Yan; Rad, Hima Nikafshan; Jamali, Danial Hamedi; Hashemian, Nasim; Ghasemi, Amir","A novel multi-generation energy system is proposed consisting of a solar gas turbine system, multi-effect seawater desalination, LNG cold energy recovery unit, and a double effect absorption chiller. In addition, different working fluids of the ORC system are examined to select the suitable working fluid in terms of global warming potential and exergy efficiency of the system. Subsequently, energy, exergy, and economic (3E) analyses are performed to comprehensively evaluate the energy system. Besides, a parametric study is conducted to assess the effect of the most influential decision variables on the proposed system. Afterward, the novel multi-objective spiral optimization (MOSPO) algorithm is introduced to minimize total cost rate of the system while maximizing the exergy efficiency as the conflicting objective functions. The proposed algorithm is developed to optimize the decision variables effectively. To ascertain the final optimum solution point, three conventional methods i.e. TOPSIS, LINMAP and Shannon's entropy are implemented. The results revealed that exergy efficiency and total cost rate of the system at the baseline are 60.05%, and 36.75 $/h, respectively. Furthermore, the net power output of the system would be 106.5 kW in addition to 0.7703 kW heating load, 56.01 kW cooling capacity, and 35.74 kg/h fresh water production capacity. The eco-environmental assessment revealed the fact that the proposed renewable-based energy system is capable of avoiding 485 tons CO2 emissions annually, and product cost rate reduction up to 6 $/hr in comparison to coal and natural gas-based energy systems. Besides, the proposed MOSPO algorithm is compared with common optimization methods; accordingly, the conventional algorithms are selected for the comparison including non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II), the multiple objective particle swarm optimization (MOPSO) algorithm, the Pareto envelope-based selection algorithm II (PESA-II), and the strength Pareto evolutionary algorithm II (SPEA-II). The comparison results show that the proposed MOSPO algorithm is preferable according to the Taylor Diagrams showing the performance of the algorithms."
1103,Analysis of the influence of groundwater on land subsidence in Beijing based on the geographical weighted regression (GWR) model,"Yu, Hairuo; Gong, Huili; Chen, Beibei; Liu, Kaisi; Gao, Mingliang","A global geological phenomenon caused by natural or human activities is described as land subsidence. Groundwater extraction plays a significant part in causing land subsidence. Due to economic development, urban expansion, and rapid population expansion, the unscientific exploitation of groundwater in Beijing has been accelerated, whichmakes it the regionwith the fastest land subsidence rate in China. To study the spatial heterogeneity of land subsidence caused by groundwater aquifers level changes, the monitoring results of land subsidence in 2003-2010 yearswere analyzed by using PS-InSAR, based on ENVISAT ASAR in Beijing plain area. Themaximum value of accumulated land subsidence in the study area is 707mm, and in this study areamultiple subsidence center areas have been formed. AGWRmodel based on a regular grid has been established by exploring the effects of unconfined aquifer (UA), first confined aquifer (FCA), second confined aquifer (SCA), third confined aquifer (TCA) on land subsidence and their spatial non-stationarity. The change of subsidence in all subsidence areas is positively related to the change of SCA water level. Except the fact that the main control factors of Liyuan and Songzhuang are the change of UA layer, the change of SCA is the main control factor of land subsidence in most subsidence areas. Though the contribution rate of SCA to land subsidence is the highest, the contribution rate of TCA has been increasing. It is predicted that the impact on land subsidence will increase year by year. The results of thiswill not only help to understand the spatial impact patterns of aquifers on land subsidence zones, but also to formulate optimal groundwater regulation and recharge policies. There is a scarcity of the consideration of the compressible layer in the study and it will become more comprehensive if further datasets are obtained. (c) 2020 Published by Elsevier B.V."

A 75-year-old man, with long-standing type 2 diabetes mellitus, presented with a 2- to 3-year history of right heel ulcer. He had received various therapies for a diagnosis of diabetic foot ulcer, to no avail. Physical examination showed a black, fungating ulcerated lesion on his right heel, with minimal bleeding. No inguinal lymphadenopathy was palpated. A biopsy was done, which revealed BRAF-negative malignant melanoma, with a vertical growth phase, Breslow 3.1 mm, ulceration, 11 mitoses/mm2, Clark level IV, no lymphatic or vascular invasion observed. Right inguinal lymph node sampling suggested no involvement, but PET-CT suggested pulmonary, right inguinal lymph node and bone involvement. The patient was referred to the oncologists. Written informed consent for publication was given by the patient. Diabetic foot ulcers are a frequently encountered, but serious complication of diabetes mellitus. Delayed healing is often seen, despite adequate therapy. The differential diagnosis of diabetic foot ulcers is vast and includes neoplasia. When a foot ulcer fails to heal, other differential diagnoses must be considered, in order for the patient to receive adequate therapy. Here specialist consultations, including dermatology consultations, could improve chances of delivering the right therapy promptly. This is a factor underlying the emphasis on a multidisciplinary approach to foot ulcer therapy. Our presentation - reported according to the CARE guidelines - also illustrates the fact that failure to reach a timely diagnosis may deny the patient the opportunity to receive adequate treatment. In such cases, ""delayed therapy becomes denied (or failed) therapy"", paraphrasing the old adage ""Justice delayed is justice denied""."
1105,How does energy poverty affect economic development? A panel data analysis of South Asian countries,"Amin, Asad; Liu, Yaping; Yu, Jie; Chandio, Abbas Ali; Rasool, Samma Faiz; Luo, Ji; Zaman, Shah","This study examines the interaction between energy poverty, employment, education, per capita income, inflation, and economic development using panel data for seven South Asian countries. The present study uses panel data spanning the period from 1995 to 2017, panel cointegration, autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL), and penalized quantile regression (PQR) estimators to test for cointegration in the long-run. The estimated results reveal that both panel cointegration approaches (Pedroni and Johansen-Fisher) demonstrate the existence of the long-term relationship between energy poverty, employment, education, per capita income, inflation, and economic development. The ARDL estimates show that energy poverty has a negative influence on economic development in both the long-run and the short-run. The results provide support for economic, social, and environmental policymakers in their decision-making. This study suggests that, in relation to financing the green and low-carbon economy concept, both the public sector and private industries need to make further efforts to use modern, energy-efficient, and green technologies, which are beneficial both for economic progress as well as managing the ecological degradation process."
1106,Foreign direct investment and education as determinants of environmental quality: The importance of post Paris Agreement (COP21),"Zafar, Muhammad Wasif; Qin, Quande; Malik, Muhammad Nasir; Zaidi, Syed Anees Haider","This study investigates the effect of foreign direct investment and education on environmental quality for Asian countries by controlling income, energy consumption, and urbanization for the period of 1990-2018. We have applied panel cointegration techniques to probe for long-run associations among the variables. The empirical results indicate the existence of cointegration between the variables. Dynamic ordinary least square and fully modified least square methods are applied to estimate long-run elasticities. The empirical results confirm that environmental quality is sensitive to foreign direct investment, education, and urbanization. Income and energy consumption deteriorate environmental quality by increasing CO2 emissions. In the long-run, bidirectional causal associations are found for emissions-foreign direct investment, emissions-energy use, income-emissions, foreign direct investment-income, and energy-income nexus. Furthermore, there is a unidirectional causality running from education and urbanization to emissions, foreign direct investment, income, and energy use. Policymakers in Asian economies are encouraged to establish policies that increase the education budget, promote the use of green energy, attract foreign direct investment with green technology, and expand cities to limit the urbanization effects on environmental quality."
1107,Effect of COVID-19 virus on reducing GHG emission and increasing energy generated by renewable energy sources: A brief study in Malaysian context,"Naderipour, Amirreza; Abdul-Malek, Zulkurnain; Ahmad, Noor Azlinda; Kamyab, Hesam; Ashokkumar, Veeramuthu; Ngamcharussrivichai, Chawalit; Chelliapan, Shreeshivadasan","Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) has globally affected the human mortality rate and economic history of the modern world. According to the World Health Organization, COVID-19 has caused a severe threat to the health of the vulnerable groups, notably the elderly. There is still some disagreements regarding the source of the virus and its intermediate host. However, the spread of this disease has caused most countries to enforce strict curfew laws and close most industrial and recreational centres. This study aims to show the potential positive effects of COVID-19 on the environment and the increase of renewable energy generation in Malaysia. To prevent the spread of this disease, Malaysia enacted the Movement Control Order (MCO) law in March 2020. Implementation of this law led to a reduction in environmental pollution, especially air pollution, in this country. The greenhouse gases (GHG) emission , which was 8 Mt CO2 eq. from January 2020 to March 2020, reduced to <1 Mt CO2 eq. for April and May. The reduction of GHG emission and pollutant gases allowed more sunlight to reach photovoltaic panels, hence increasing the renewable energy generation. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

These oocytes can be further fertilized and generate good quality embryos to be transferred, ideally in the same cycle. Since 2013, following the results of a meta-analysis including more than 60,000 IVF cycles, the negative effects of premature progesterone elevation on reproductive outcomes have been demonstrated. Nowadays, evidence is emerging on the limited regulation on serum progesterone values, demonstrating significantly lower live birth rates in patients with either low (<0.5ng/ml) late follicular phase progesterone or higher levels decreasing sharply. This review discusses and summarizes the different mechanisms of progesterone elevation and its impact on IVF treatments. Different approaches to diminish the impact of progesterone on fertility outcomes are also addressed."

A fully online section of an established face-to-face (F2F) two-semester undergraduate anatomy course with a prosection laboratory commenced in 2012 at The University of Western Ontario, Canada. Professors' lectures for F2F students were broadcast in live and archived format to online students using Blackboard Collaborate (BBC) video conferencing software. Teaching assistants (TAs) delivered online laboratories using BBC and three-dimensional (3D) anatomical computer models. This study explored the common experiences and issues faced by the course teachers from 2012 to 2014. Transcripts from open-ended, individual interviews with professors (n = 4) and TAs (n = 5) were coded and analyzed thematically. The teachers' concern for their inability to see the students during sessions to assess class engagement and their teaching effectiveness, and to develop social relationships, was the main finding. However, video conferencing software and email were sufficient communication methods for the students' questions and the teachers' answers. The TAs noted usability challenges and anatomical inaccuracies in the 3D models compared to cadavers. Due to limitations of BBC's screen sharing function, live manipulation for the 3D computer models was not possible; however, the TAs found pedagogical value in using screen captures of the models for drawing activities with the students. Overall, preparation time for teaching online was longer than for F2F. The study's findings provide science educators with issues to consider when preparing for online teaching and recommendations to optimize the teaching experience."

Many organizations are becoming motivated more than ever to introduce new business models, modern technologies, and supportive policies with an effort to cope with critical issues connected to climate change. The present study has investigated the mediating effect of psychological safety on the relationship between sustainable leadership and sustainable performance as well as evaluating the moderation impact of psychological empowerment on that relationship. To date, the present research is the first attempt wherein the incorporation of psychological empowerment and psychological safety has redefined the association between sustainable leadership and sustainable performance. Using cluster sampling approach, the data for this research was collected from 405 SMEs from Kuala Lumpur (Malaysia), Jakarta (Indonesia), and Bandar Seri Begawan (Brunei Darussalam). Using structural equation modelling (variance-based), this study has analyzed proposed hypothesis. Hierarchical regression analysis (PROCESS Macro) in SPSS was employed to analyze the moderated-mediation impact of psychological empowerment. The empirical results confirm that sustainable leadership has a substantial impact on psychological safety. This study confirms that sustainable leadership has positive indirect effect on sustainable performance through psychological safety which amplifies in the presence of psychological empowerment. Establishment of a psychologically safe environment that encourages knowledge sharing and openness to speaking will improve sustainable performance in the presence of sustainable leadership. Therefore, the development of practices that promote psychological empowerment among employees is essential. This study broadens our understanding of sustainable performance toward sustainable leaders, its underlying mechanism and conditional effect, making contribution to the psychology of honeybee leadership.

The ecological succession of macrofouling communities was analysed on wooden and stainless steel panels coated with four copper(I)-based AF (Paints A-D) immersed for 10 months in the Lagoon of Venice. With the exception of Paint B, which contained only copper(I) compounds and was based on hard-matrix technology, the other paints were based on self-polishing matrices and various booster biocides. The booster content was a mix of TBT compounds for Paint A, dichlofluanid for Paint C, Irgarol 1051, and chlorothalonil for Paint D. The macrofouling communities appeared dissimilar to those on the reference uncoated panels as regard the species richness, the coverage areas, and the biocoenosis structure. Generally, green algae, bryozoans, and barnacles were the most tolerant taxa and a negative species selection occurred for sponges, serpulids, and ascidians. Paints A and D showed the highest performance, and Paint D also prevented molluscs on wood panels. Paints B and C rapidly decreased their efficiency, the first probably due to the insoluble matrix with the highest biocidal leaching rate, and the second due to the presence of a booster with low toxicity. Paint B also inhibited red algae and molluscs, but Paint C did not reveal significant differences in types of species settlements with reference panels."

E.; Shen, Ye; Wang, Chi-Hwa; Dai, Yanjun; Tong, Yen Wah","Effectiveness of biochar addition to enhance thermophilic semi-continuous anaerobic digestion (AD) of food waste for methane production was investigated with a focus on dosage and particle size of biochar, pilot-scale application and elucidation of methanogenic pathways. Optimal dosage range of biochar was determined as 7.5 to 15 g per L working volume based on lab-scale batch AD. Effects of biochar with different particle sizes at a model dosage of 15 g/L were evaluated in a semi-continuous AD experiment, results of which showed that all the examined biochars with different particle sizes (< 50 mu m to 3 cm) substantially enhanced the average methane yields (0.465-0.543 L/gVS) compared to control digesters which failed due to overloading (>= 3.04 gVS/L/d). No significant difference in methane yields, however, was observed among digesters with different particle sizes of biochars, except for 1-3 cm. The core reason for this phenomenon was that the biochars with different particle sizes had similar properties (e.g. density, surface area and pore size) and that the floating of large particle size (1-3 cm) of biochar with a density of 847 kg/m(3) was not conducive to microbial growth. Metagenomic analysis was performed to determine the predominant microbial species and to explain the main methanogenic pathways in biochar-amended digesters using 16S rRNA sequencing. In the biochar-amended digester, bacterial phylum Thermotogae containing a major genus of Defluviitoga was selectively enriched with gradual increase of organic loadings, while simultaneously enriched methanogen genera Methanothermobacter and Methanosarcina, which showed a synergy of hydrogenotrophic and acetoclastic methanogenic pathways, jointly enhanced the methane productivity. Both technical feasibility and economic feasibility of adding biochar with simple pretreatment (e.g. smash) were validated in the pilot-scale thermophilic semi-continuous AD operations."

Methods: We utilized Twitter's Streaming Application Programming Interface (API) to collect 3,377,295 U.S. race-related tweets from November 2019-June 2020. Sentiment analysis was performed using support vector machine (SVM), a supervised machine learning model. Accuracy for identifying negative sentiments, comparing the machine learning model to manually labeled tweets was 91%. We investigated changes in racial sentiment before and following the emergence of COVID-19. Results: The proportion of negative tweets referencing Asians increased by 68.4% (from 9.79% in November to 16.49% in March). In contrast, the proportion of negative tweets referencing other racial/ethnic minorities (Blacks and Latinx) remained relatively stable during this time period, declining less than 1% for tweets referencing Blacks and increasing by 2% for tweets referencing Latinx. Common themes that emerged during the content analysis of a random subsample of 3300 tweets included: racism and blame (20%), anti-racism (20%), and daily life impact (27%). Conclusion: Social media data can be used to provide timely information to investigate shifts in area-level racial sentiment."
1114,"Industrialization, urbanization and CO2 emissions in Saudi Arabia: Asymmetry analysis","Mahmood, Haider; Alkhateeb, Tarek Tawfik Yousef; Furqan, Maham","Keeping a sustainable environment is always a massive challenge for oil-exporting countries, and in that situation, industrialization and rapid growth of urbanization can add fuel to the fire. We investigate the effects of industrialization and urbanization on the CO2 emissions per capita in Saudi Arabia, utilizing an annual period 1968-2014. The results show that both industrialization and urbanization impede the environment with the inelastic effect of industrialization and elastic effect of urbanization on the emissions. An asymmetry in the relationship of industrialization and emissions is also found. The increasing industrialization has larger environmental effect than decreasing industrialization. We recommend the Saudi government to design tighter urban and industrial-environmental policies to put a halt on increasing CO2 emissions. (C) 2020 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd."
1115,Reparative and Immunomodulatory Potential of Low-Molecular-Weight Fractions of Secondary Metabolites of Bacillus sp,"L F Kalenova,S A Petrov,Yu G Sukhovei,L F Kalenova,S A Petrov,Yu G Sukhovei","The experiment was performed on male BALB/c mice with modeled skin wound. Two chromatographic fractions of secondary metabolites of permafrost bacteria Bacillus sp., that represent a mixture of polyethylene-polypropylene glycols oligomers with a molecular weight from 900 to 1350 Da were used as therapeutic agents. Application of the test substances on the wound surface and their parenteral administration significantly accelerated wound epithelialization in comparison with untreated control, activated metabolic processes, and improved humoral immunity. In in vitro experiments, the fractions activated the synthesis of IFNγ and IL-4 by human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. We conclude that polyethylene-polypropylene glycol oligomers can be a part of effector molecules that determine the repair and immunomodulatory potential of secondary metabolites of permafrost microorganisms Bacillus sp."

At the same time, more and more people are leaving the nursing profession. According to a recent representative online survey, 45 percent of Austrian nursing professionals in the acute care sector regularly consider leaving the profession. The International Council of Nurses (ICN) even warns of a worldwide ""mass exodus"" from nursing due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Markus Golla from IMC FH Krems pleads for a complete re-examination of nursing profession and of the perspective on aging in general. Two geriatric nurses give an insight into their everyday working lives and how they feel about working in this profession today. The problems of nursing have been known for years. Politicians are urgently called upon to set the course for a good future for nursing care in Austria."
1117,Closed loop supply chain network for local and distributed plastic recycling for 3D printing: a MILP-based optimization approach,"Santander, Pavlo; Sanchez, Fabio A. Cruz; Boudaoud, Hakim; Camargo, Mauricio","Recent research and initiatives increasingly propose a new approach, based on distributed plastic recycling for open-source (OS) 3D printing technologies, as a way to deal with the issue of plastic waste and to support the development of the circular economy (CE). Distributed recycling can be thought of as a sort of ""smart grid"", composed of small and coordinated recycling units. However, the operational complexity of this distributed approach limits its application. Furthermore, the environmental and economic advantages have yet to be demonstrated. This article therefore explores the economic and environmental feasibility of this distributed plastic recycling approach from a logistics perspective, as a step towards its validation. To achieve this, an optimization mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model was used as an evaluation tool, representing a local closed loop supply chain (CLSC) network. The proposed model is illustrated using a case study of a university seeking to implement a distributed recycling demonstrator in order to recover 3D printing wastes from secondary schools in the northeast of France. Following this step, a sensitivity analysis was carried out considering the market variations (price of virgin plastic filament) and the amount of available plastic waste derived from the schools. The results obtained show positive economic and environmental benefits of carrying out this new method of plastic recycling. This work serves as a basis for continuing to explore the feasibility and replication of the distributed plastic recycling network in other contexts."

While waste is a risk, it is also an opportunity to solve this dual problem through utilization of waste as a potential source of energy and products. In order to reconcile the management of waste to the scale of its production, several researches are being pursued. Establishment of bioeconomy is a great way to achieve this goal. But inherent challenges associated with biowaste include manageability of by-products and sludge, wide variety in waste composition, efficiency of the process and economic viability of treatment technologies to scale-up and industrialize beyond laboratory setup. Recent advancements have been made in this regard with the use of new techniques, synergistic catalysts, combination of technologies and novel treatment materials to remediate the challenges and maximize the value of waste by utilizing it as a feedstock to produce industrial chemicals, fuels and materials. This review provides an insight into these developments, along with the critical discussion, limitations and economic feasibility of waste valorization technologies to provide new understanding for the advancement of bioeconomy."

However, the biological significance of ZNF267 and its potential role in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) remain to be documented. Experiments were herein conducted to study the role of ZNF267 in DLBCL. real-time quantitative reverse transcription PCR and Western blotting assays were conducted to detect the expression of ZNF267 in tissues and cells. Tissue microarray and bioinformatics analyses of public data were also done to detect the expression status and clinical significance of ZNF267. Functional cell experiments including CCK8 assay, colony formation assay, 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine (EDU) assay, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase biotin-dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay, transwell assay, and wound healing assay were conducted to study the effects of ZNF267 knockdown and overexpression on cell proliferation and mobility. Xenograft assay was also conducted to confirm the effects of ZNF267 knockdown in vivo. In the present study, we found ZNF267 was significantly upregulated in DLBCL and predicted a poor survival outcome based on the bioinformatics analysis. Functionally, the knockdown of ZNF267 resulted in less cell proliferation and mobility, whereas the overexpression led to enhanced cell proliferation and mobility. Animal experiments also confirmed that ZNF267 silence contributed to less tumor growth and less lung metastasis. Further analysis showed that ZFN267 knockdown resulted in decreased epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and cancer stem cell (CSC) properties. Our results suggest that ZNF267 is an oncogene in DLBCL and its silence could compromise the aggression of DLBCL, which makes ZNF267 a promising therapeutic target."
1120,"Influencing Factors of Chinese Consumers' Purchase Intention to Sustainable Apparel Products: Exploring Consumer ""Attitude-Behavioral Intention"" Gap","Jung, Hye Jung; Choi, Yun Jung; Oh, Kyung Wha","As the rapid economic growth and over-consumption within the largest population worldwide has resulted in harmful environment deterioration, a shift to more sustainable consumption behaviors is required in China. Although public interests in sustainability have increased and consumers' attitudes are positive, their behavioral intentions are not consistent with attitudes. This study aims to uncover psychological drivers and barriers (consumption values, social norms, and attitudes to sustainable apparel products) of Chinese consumers' behavioral intentions toward sustainable apparel products (SAP) by exploring the attitude-behavioral intention gap. Online survey data were used to examine the moderating impacts of consumption values and social norms on relationship between Chinese consumers' attitudes and behavioral intentions toward SAP. Results from moderating regression analysis suggest that (1) Chinese consumers' SAP attitudes had a strong positive effect on the purchase intention toward SAP, (2) aesthetic values positively moderated the relationship between the SAP attitude and purchase intention, whereas conspicuous values negatively moderated the relationship, and (3) utility values and social norms did not show any significant moderating influences on the relationship between the SAP attitude and purchase intention. Our study validates the attitude-behavior gap model in sustainable consumer behavior and discusses how the current findings can assist researchers and practitioners in the Clothing and Textiles field alike to fine-tune sustainable programs and marketing strategies in China."

Methods: We performed a retrospective review of 258 patients (> 94% adults) referred to a multidisciplinary clinic for evaluation of joint hypermobility between January 2017 and December 2020 and diagnosed with hEDS or a hypermobility spectrum disorder (HSD) to determine the incidence and spectrum of cardiovascular involvement. Results: Mitral valve prolapse was present in 7.5% and thoracic aortic dilatation in 15.2%. Aortic dilatation was more frequent in individuals with hEDS (20.7%) than with HSD (7.7%) and similarly prevalent between males and females, although was mild in > 90% of females and moderate-to-severe in 50% of males. Five individuals (1.9%) with hEDS/HSD had extra-aortic arterial involvement, including cervical artery dissection (CeAD, n = 2), spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD, n = 2), and SCAD plus celiac artery pseudoaneurysm (n = 1). This is the first series to report the prevalence of CeAD and SCAD in hEDS/HSD. Conclusions: Cardiovascular manifestations in adults with hEDS/HSD, especially females, are typically mild and readily assessed by echocardiography. Since the risk of progression has not yet been defined, adults with hEDS/HSD who are found to have aortic dilatation at baseline should continue ongoing surveillance to monitor for progressive dilatation. Cardiovascular medicine specialists, neurologists, and neurosurgeons should consider hEDS/HSD on the differential for patients with CeAD or SCAD who also have joint hypermobility."
1122,The potential of straw mulch as a nature-based solution for soil erosion in olive plantation treated with glyphosate: A biophysical and socioeconomic assessment,"Rodrigo-Comino, Jesus; Gimenez-Morera, Antonio; Panagos, Panos; Pourghasemi, Hamid Reza; Pulido, Manuel; Cerda, Artemi","Fifty paired plots under simulated rainfall showed that the use of a cover of straw mulch of 50% (1 mg ha(-1)) in olive orchards results in a reduction of soil erosion. An economic survey based on interviews shows that the use of straw mulch in olive plantation would cost euro174.7 ha(-1), from which euro54.7 ha(-1)is needed for the application work, euro52.3 ha(-1)for the purchase cost, and euro67.7 ha(-1)for the transport of 20-kg bales. The cost of the straw is 22.5% of the total income of the farmers. We found that their perception was negative about the use of straw mulch, as the tradition is to keep the soil clean from any weed or cover, except the crop. However, farmers would use it if they would be subsidized with a minimum of euro267 ha(-1), which is euro92 ha(-1)more than the costs estimated on the basis of the surveys. We conclude that soil erosion can be controlled with the use of straw mulch but that to convince farmers to adopt this management strategy, it needs to be subsidized."

When yielded to external attacks, plants generally produce metabolites to defend themselves. The physicochemical characteristics of this kind of compounds have allowed their usage as potential bioinsecticides. The Hymenaea courbaril L. (algarrobo) has proven to be a plant rich in metabolites with outstanding biological activity, in such a way that some of its extracts have been tested as insecticides. The goal of this study was to know the phytochemical composition of Hymenaea courbaril L.'s resin and perform evaluations in vivo of its toxic and genotoxic effects in the biological model Drosophila melanogaster. For this, two resin extracts were prepared and both a phytochemical analysis were carried out on them, having found in the ethanolic total extract the presence of terpenes, flavonoids and coumarins, while in the partial ethanolic extract only presence of terpenes and flavonoids was found. Drosophila larvae were submitted to different concentrations of the extracts and both the survival and the sexual ratio were evaluated, finding that larvae are more sensitive to the partial ethanolic extract. Subsequently, the induction of somatic mutation and mitotic recombination (SMART) was evaluated in the flies' eyes. The most significant affectations at a genotoxic level were found when larvae were tested with the partial extract, indicating that possibly the coumarins absence makes this insect more susceptible to damages at a genetic material level."
1124,Comparing coal phase-out pathways: The United Kingdom's and Germany's diverging transitions,"Brauers, Hanna; Oei, Pao-Yu; Walk, Paula","Political decisions and trends regarding coal use for electricity generation developed differently in the UK and Germany, despite being subject to relatively similar climate protection targets and general political and economic conditions. The UK agreed on a coal phase-out by 2024. In Germany, a law schedules a coal phase-out by 2038 at the latest. This paper investigates reasons for the different developments and aims to identify main hurdles and drivers of coal phase-outs by using the Triple Embeddedness Framework. The comparative case study approach reveals that policy outcomes regarding coal consumption are deeply influenced by several actor groups, namely, coal companies, unions, environmental NGOs, and the government. The most discussed aspects of a coal phase-out in both countries are energy security concerns, whether coal is mined domestically, (regional) economic dependence, as well as the relative power of actors with vested interests in coal consumption."

Sample collection was carried out on 10 auto-monitoring stations in Changchun, and PM2.5 mass concentration and its chemical components (including inorganic elements, organic carbon, elemental carbon, and water-soluble ions) were measured. The results show that the annual average mass concentration of PM2.5 in Changchun in 2014 was about 66.77 μg/m3. Organic matter was the highest component in PM2.5, followed by secondary inorganic ions (SNA), mineral dust (MIN), elemental carbon (EC), and trace elements (TE). Positive matrix factorization (PMF) results gave seven factors, namely, industrial, biomass and coal burning, industrial and soil dust, motor vehicle, soil and secondary ion, light industrial, and hybrid automotive and industrial sources in PM2.5, with contributing values of 18.9%, 24.2%, 5.7%, 23.0%, 11.5%, 13.0%, and 3.6%, respectively."

The life cycle assessment (LCA) procedure was involved in the agricultural strategic development planning for Balkan region, as a useful tool to identify and quantify potential environmental impacts from the production of apple juice, wine and pepper pesto in three selected sites in Greece, North Macedonia and Bulgaria. These three products were chosen, as are considered as the main economic activities at the areas. The LCA approach covered the entire production line of each product. Based on the LCA results, which comprise the size of six impact categories characterization factors, suggestions were made in order to minimize the footprint of the apples orchard, vineyard and pepper cultivation plots as well as of the production processes of apple juice, wine and pepper pesto as final distribution products. The results indicate that changes in the cultivation and the production must be considered in order to optimize the environmental footprint. Moreover, the whole approach could be useful for agricultural stakeholders, policy makers and producers, in order to improve their products ecological performance, reduce food loss and food waste and increase the productivity of the agricultural sector, while at the same time can improve the three pillars of sustainability through strategy development."
1127,The asymmetric effects of fiscal and monetary policy instruments on Pakistan's environmental pollution,"Ullah, Sana; Ozturk, Ilhan; Sohail, Sidra","Maintaining a balance between environmental quality and economic growth is now one of the common goals of fiscal and monetary policies in developed and developing economies. This study examines the asymmetric impacts of fiscal and monetary policy instruments on environmental pollution in Pakistan over the period 1985-2019 by employing the asymmetric or nonlinear autoregressive distributed lag (NARDL) framework. The outcomes indicate that in Pakistan, a positive and negative shock in fiscal policy instruments has a significant increasing influence on carbon emissions in the short run, while a positive and negative shock in fiscal policy instruments has a significant decreasing impact on environmental pollution in long run. However, negative and positive shock in monetary policy instruments enhances carbon emissions in short-run, whereas positive shock in monetary policy instruments decreases carbon emissions in the long run. Therefore, the policymakers may consider the usage of fiscal and monetary policy instruments to maintain economic growth along with lowering the environmental pollution."

We find that (i) the Andean flora comprises at least 28 691 georeferenced species documented to date, (ii) Northern Andean mid-elevation cloud forests are the most species-rich Andean ecosystems, (iii) the Andes are a key source and sink of Neotropical plant diversity, and (iv) the Andes, Amazonia, and other Neotropical biomes have had a considerable amount of biotic interchange through time."
1130,Traffic Impacts of the COVID-19 Pandemic: Statewide Analysis of Social Separation and Activity Restriction,"Parr, Scott; Wolshon, Brian; Renne, John; Murray-Tuite, Pamela; Kim, Karl","The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in significant social and economic impacts throughout the world. In addition to the health consequences, the impacts on travel behavior have also been sudden and wide ranging. This study describes the drastic changes in human behavior using the analysis of highway volume data as a representation of personal activity and interaction. Same-day traffic volumes for 2019 and 2020 across Florida were analyzed to identify spatial and temporal changes in behavior resulting from the disease or fear of it and statewide directives to limit person-to-person interaction. Compared to similar days in 2019, overall statewide traffic volume dropped by 47.5%. Although decreases were evident across the state, there were also differences between rural and urban areas and between highways and arterials both in terms of the timing and extent. The data and analyses help to demonstrate the early impacts of the pandemic and may be useful for operational and strategic planning of recovery efforts and for dealing with future pandemics."
1131,New results on precautionary saving and nonlinear risks,"Claudio Bonilla,Marcos Vergara,Claudio Bonilla,Marcos Vergara","We study precautionary saving in a two-period model that allows for nonlinear risks and nonseparable preferences. Permitting nonlinear risk effects is important because they are common in the developing world or when worldwide shocks hit economies, like the COVID-19 pandemic. Allowing nonseparable preferences is also important because they admit the incorporation of intergenerational transfer, habit persistence and other specific features of intertemporal decision making. We decompose the risk shock using Davis's (Int Econ Rev 30(1):131-136, 1989) compensation method and analyze the income and substitution effect of an increase in risk. We prove that the substitution effect is always negative and, therefore, the income effect must be positive and larger in size to have a precautionary net effect. We then apply the method to various sources of risk, such as income, interest rate and wealth risk. We analyze the magnitude of each effect and find the conditions required to guarantee precautionary saving in each case. Our results are presented as signs of covariances, which provides a new perspective on precautionary saving."

Using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), MSS was subjected to thermal decomposition experiments at four different heating rates of 5, 10, 30 and 50 degrees C/min. TGA curves were divided into three distinctive stages, namely drying zone (T ( )<= 200 degrees C), active pyrolysis zone (200 < T < 600 degrees C), and char decomposition zone (T >= 600 degrees C). Moreover, the data were used to analyze thermokinetic parameters through Flynn-Wall-Ozawa (FWO), Kissenger-Akahira-Sunose (KAS), and Starink methods, where the average values of E-a (126.62-136.92 kJ/mol), Gibbs free energy (159.19-159.61 kJ/mol), and calculated high heating value (HHV, 16.47 +/- 0.03 MJ/kg) showed the considerable bioenergy potential of the low-cost biomass. The low difference between E-a and Delta H (similar to 5 kJ/mol) showed that product formation was favorable during pyrolysis. In addition, for the first time, the comparative study of the results predicted from support vector regression (SVR) model and the experimental data, showed a satisfactory agreement (R-2 > 0.9999) and accurate results regarding different train-test data categories. Further employed was Pyrolysis-Gas Chromatography/Mass Spectroscopy (Py-GC/MS) at 700 degrees C to characterize the potential chemical products, which indicated the presence of a range of aromatic and aliphatic hydrocarbons, nitrogen-containing compounds, alcohol, furans and sulfur compounds. Finally, three alternative scenarios associated with the planned project were presented and techno-socio-economic assessment (TSEA) of the alternative scenarios were evaluated, for the first time, by means of economic indexes and considering social aspects. Net present value (NPV) of all alternative scenarios of the pyrolysis plant over the 20-year plant lifetime was positive compared to the base case, indicating that the project was feasible. Sensitivity analysis of the optimistic scenario showed that the profitability of pyrolysis plant was highly dependent on bio-oil selling price and total production cost."
1133,The Influence of Gender Equality on Volunteering Among European Senior Citizens,"Julia Sánchez-García,Ana Isabel Gil-Lacruz,Marta Gil-Lacruz,Julia Sánchez-García,Ana Isabel Gil-Lacruz,Marta Gil-Lacruz","This research analyzes how gender equality influences the participation of European senior citizens in a range of volunteering activities (Social Awareness, Professional and Political, Education, and Religion). The main contribution is the simultaneous consideration of different levels of data aggregation: individual, national and welfare system. This allows conclusions to be drawn on the effects of variables linked to sociodemographic characteristics, gender equality and welfare systems. The empirical estimation utilised microdata from the World Values Survey (2005/09 and 2010/14) and the United Nations Development Programme. Results suggest that the European senior citizens appear to believe that they are more equal than the official statistics of their countries indicate. Men are more likely to participate in professional and education activities; women are more likely to be involved in religious organisations. Welfare systems influence volunteering behaviours. The promotion of macro-policies for gender equality could be important for increasing participation in non-profit organisations."

There was a remarkable antioxidant capacity found in all Artemisia methanolic extracts analysed."
1136,Assessment of Quality of Life Among Health Professionals During COVID-19: Review,"Usha Rani Kandula,Addisu Dabi Wake,Usha Rani Kandula,Addisu Dabi Wake","In 2019, coronavirus disease pandemic (COVID-19) influences the quality of life of health personnel who are on the front lines in dealing with COVID-19 patients. The purpose of this study is to assess the quality of life of health professionals during the COVID-19 epidemic. The novel coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) has spread across the globe with the direct causal viral agent of severe acute respiratory syndrome-corona virus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) and infected many people. All health professionals (HPs) such as physicians, nurses, and other allied health staff members are primary caregivers in hospitals and other health care settings, specifically under pandemic situations such as COVID-19. The emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic has caused numerous diversions in the preservation of the quality of life (QoL) of health professionals by deviations from normal physical, mental, and social wellbeing aspects. HPs are the most vulnerable population to COVID-19 viral transmission while delivering emergency medical services to persons infected with the virus in various health care sectors, such as direct engagement in lifesaving management. In this perspective, some recent literature on QoL of health professionals was examined, uncovering that they frequently experience fear and anxiety due to viral transmissions in the place of work and probable cross-contamination among family members, tend to experience insomnia caused by sudden increased work pressure, struggle to balance professional and personal life, suffering from mental health disturbances such as depressive episodes, mood disturbances, and suicidal tendencies due to the unpredictability of the disease outbreak. The current review is looking to determine and address the degree of QoL maintained by specific types of health professionals during critical moments of COVID-19 pandemics. This study may assist health organization stakeholders in enhancing QoL among health professionals by introducing required provisions, measures, or initiatives for the welfare of health professionals, notably in resolving pandemic demands in all health organizations."
1137,Recent Advances in the Clinical Value and Potential of Dexmedetomidine,"Xiaotian Liu,Yueqin Li,Li Kang,Qian Wang,Xiaotian Liu,Yueqin Li,Li Kang,Qian Wang","Dexmedetomidine, a highly selective α2-adrenoceptor agonist, has sedative, anxiolytic, analgesic, sympatholytic, and opioid-sparing properties and induces a unique sedative response which shows an easy transition from sleep to wakefulness, thus allowing a patient to be cooperative and communicative when stimulated. Recent studies indicate several emerging clinical applications via different routes. We review recent data on dexmedetomidine studies, particularly exploring the varying routes of administration, experimental implications, clinical effects, and comparative advantages over other drugs. A search was conducted on the PubMed and Web of Science libraries for recent studies using different combinations of the words ""dexmedetomidine"", ""route of administration"", and pharmacological effect. The current routes, pharmacological effects, and application categories of dexmedetomidine are presented. It functions by stimulating pre- and post-synaptic α2-adrenoreceptors within the central nervous system, leading to hyperpolarization of noradrenergic neurons, induction of an inhibitory feedback loop, and reduction of norepinephrine secretion, causing a sympatholytic effect, in addition to its anti-inflammation, sleep induction, bowel recovery, and sore throat reduction effects. Compared with similar α2-adrenoceptor agonists, dexmedetomidine has both pharmacodynamics advantage of a significantly greater α2:α1-adrenoceptor affinity ratio and a pharmacokinetic advantage of having a significantly shorter elimination half-life. In its clinical application, dexmedetomidine has been reported to present a significant number of benefits including safe sedation for various surgical interventions, improvement of intraoperative and postoperative analgesia, sedation for compromised airways without respiratory depression, nephroprotection and stability of hypotensive hemodynamics, reduction of postoperative nausea and vomiting and postoperative shivering incidence, and decrease of intraoperative blood loss. Although the clinical application of dexmedetomidine is promising, it is still limited and further research is required to enhance understanding of its pharmacological properties, patient selection, dosage, and adverse effects."
1138,Protease-Activated Receptors - Key Regulators of Inflammatory Bowel Diseases Progression,"Damian Jacenik,Jakub Fichna,Ewa Małecka-Wojciesko,Anna Mokrowiecka,Damian Jacenik,Jakub Fichna,Ewa Małecka-Wojciesko,Anna Mokrowiecka","The pathogenesis and course of inflammatory bowel diseases are related to both immune system disorders and dysfunction of colon permeability. Moreover, co-existing diseases in patients with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis are identified. Currently, there are some therapeutic strategies that affect the function of cytokine/s causing inflammation in the intestinal wall. However, additional approaches which target other components of inflammatory bowel diseases pathogenesis are still needed. Accumulating evidence suggests that proteases and protease-activated receptors seem to be responsible for colitis progression. Experimental and observational studies showed alteration of protease-activated receptors expression in the colon of patients with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. Furthermore, it was suggested that the expression of protease-activated receptors correlated with inflammatory bowel diseases activity. Moreover, regulation of protease-activated receptors seems to be responsible for the modulation of colitis and clinical manifestation of inflammatory bowel diseases. In this review, we present the current state of knowledge about the contribution of protease-activated receptors to Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis and its implications for diagnosis and treatment."
1139,"Impact of average temperature, energy demand, sectoral value added, and population growth on water resource quality and mortality rate: it is time to stop waiting around","Tehreem, Hafiza Samina; Anser, Muhammad Khalid; Nassani, Abdelmohsen A.; Abro, Muhammad Moinuddin Qazi; Zaman, Khalid","It is an overwhelming concern that increases in global average temperature lead to serious consequences on the natural environment in the form of deteriorating water resource quality and damaging healthcare sustainability agenda. The sustainable innovation forum (COP21) shows a high concern on climate changes and suggested to reduce global average temperature less than 2 degrees C. The study brings an idea from the stated theme and analyzed the relationship between climate change and water resource quality in order to redesign economic and environmental policies to improve water quality and healthcare sustainability in the context of Pakistan. The country has serious issues regarding the provision of safe drinking water, improved water resource quality, and healthcare sustainability, which can be achieved by sustainable policies to handle the extreme temperature in Pakistan. The study employed simultaneous generalized method of moments (GMM) technique in order to estimate parameters of the study during the period of 1980-2016. The results show that energy demand and industry value added substantially decrease water resource quality (WRQ), while agriculture value added and per capita income significantly increase WRQ in a country. The other regression apparatus, where health expenditures serve as the response variable, shows that average temperature, industry value added, population growth, and foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows significantly increase healthcare expenditures while WRQ has a negative impact on healthcare expenditures in a country. The final regression model shows that average temperature and per capita income decrease, while WRQ and industrial value added increase mortality rate in a country. The overall results confirm that WRQ affected by climate change, energy demand, and population growth that need sustainable water resource policies in order to achieve long-term sustained growth. The climate actions required more policy instruments to combat environmental challenges that should support healthcare sustainability agenda across the globe."
1140,Sustainable valorization of paper mill sludge into cellulose nanofibrils and cellulose nanopaper,"Du, Haishun; Parit, Mahesh; Wu, Meiyan; Che, Xinpeng; Wang, Yifan; Zhang, Miaomiao; Wang, Ruigang; Zhang, Xinyu; Jiang, Zhihua; Li, Bin","As a kind of agro-industrial wastes, paper mill sludge (PMS) has posed serious environmental and economic challenges for disposal due to the more stringent regulations and diminishing land availability in recent years. The present study is aimed at providing a sustainable approach to efficiently convert PMS to cellulose nanofibrils (CNFs) and cellulose nanopaper (CNP) by formic acid (FA) hydrolysis pretreatment and the followed micro fluidization. It is found that FA hydrolysis (4-6 h) could swell and shorten PMS fibers, and only two-pass microfluidization is sufficient to get uniform CNFs from the collected cellulose residual. Results indicate that the obtained CNFs show high thermal stability and crystallinity index, surface functionality (ester groups), as well as a high yield of over 75 wt.%. Notably, more than 90 % FA can be recovered and the hydrolyzed sugars could be potentially used to produce platform chemicals (e.g. lactic acid, furfural). Finally, transparent CNP is prepared from the CNFs suspension via a simple vacuum filtration technique. The resultant CNP shows good mechanical properties with the maximum tensile strength and toughness of 106.4 MPa and 6.62 MJ/m(3), respectively. Therefore, the current work provides a green and sustainable method to valorize PMS for the production of valuable CNFs and CNP."
1141,Levelized cost of solar photovoltaics and wind supported by storage technologies to supply firm electricity,"Gupta, Ruchi; Soini, Martin Christoph; Patel, Martin Kumar; Parra, David","Energy storage technologies can assist intermittent solar and wind power to supply firm electricity by forming flexible hybrid systems. However, evaluating these hybrid systems has proved to be a major challenge, since their techno-economic performance depends on a large number of parameters, including the renewable energy generation profile, operational parameters of storage technologies and their associated costs. In this study, we develop a method to simulate the performance and determine the levelized cost of hybrid systems to provide firm electricity supply under various supply strategies such as peak demand and baseload at three different scales (representative sizes). The methodology is implemented for Switzerland, however, it can also be replicated for other geographies. Our results show that the optimal choice for a hybrid system depends on the scale rather than the supply mode strategy. We find that solar photovoltaics in combination with lithium-ion battery at the residential (0.39 to 0.77 EUR/kWh) and utility scale (0.17 to 0.36 EUR/kWh) as well as with pumped hydro storage at the bulk scale (0.13 to 0.18 EUR/kWh) offer the lowest levelized costs. Reducing the cost of both renewable and storage technologies as well as the storage size by allowing some level of curtailment or distortion in the firm supply profile improves the cost-competitiveness of hybrid systems."
1142,Daily consumption of wild olive (acebuche) oil reduces blood pressure and ameliorates endothelial dysfunction and vascular remodelling in rats with NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester-induced hypertension,"Claudia Reyes-Goya,Álvaro Santana-Garrido,Gema Aguilar-Espejo,M Carmen Pérez-Camino,Alfonso Mate,Carmen M Vázquez,Claudia Reyes-Goya,Álvaro Santana-Garrido,Gema Aguilar-Espejo,M Carmen Pérez-Camino,Alfonso Mate,Carmen M Vázquez","Despite numerous reports on the beneficial effects of olive oil in the cardiovascular context, very little is known about the olive tree's wild counterpart (Olea europaea, L. var. sylvestris), commonly known as acebuche (ACE) in Spain. The aim of this study was to analyse the possible beneficial effects of an extra virgin ACE oil on vascular function in a rodent model of arterial hypertension (AH) induced by NG-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME). Four experimental groups of male Wistar rats were studied: (1) normotensive rats (Control group); (2) normotensive rats fed a commercial diet supplemented with 15 % (w/w) ACE oil (Acebuche group); (3) rats made hypertensive following administration of L-NAME (L-NAME group); and (4) rats treated with L-NAME and simultaneously supplemented with 15 % ACE oil (LN + ACE group). All treatments were maintained for 12 weeks. Besides a significant blood pressure (BP)-lowering effect, the ACE oil-enriched diet counteracted the alterations found in aortas from hypertensive rats in terms of morphology and responsiveness to vasoactive mediators. In addition, a decrease in hypertension-related fibrotic and oxidative stress processes was observed in L-NAME-treated rats subjected to ACE oil supplement. Therefore, using a model of AH via nitric oxide depletion, here we demonstrate the beneficial effects of a wild olive oil based upon its vasodilator, antihypertensive, antioxidant, antihypertrophic and antifibrotic properties. We postulate that regular inclusion of ACE oil in the diet can alleviate the vascular remodelling and endothelial dysfunction processes typically found in AH, thus resulting in a significant reduction of BP."
1143,Use of a purified reconstituted bilayer matrix in the management of chronic diabetic foot ulcers improves patient outcomes vs standard of care: Results of a prospective randomised controlled multi-centre clinical trial,"David G Armstrong,Dennis P Orgill,Robert D Galiano,Paul M Glat,Jarrod P Kaufman,Marissa J Carter,Lawrence A DiDomenico,Charles M Zelen,David G Armstrong,Dennis P Orgill,Robert D Galiano,Paul M Glat,Jarrod P Kaufman,Marissa J Carter,Lawrence A DiDomenico,Charles M Zelen","Diabetic foot infections continue to be a major challenge for health care delivery systems. Following encouraging results from a pilot study using a novel purified reconstituted bilayer matrix (PRBM) to treat chronic diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs), we designed a prospective, multi-centre randomised trial comparing outcomes of PRBM at 12 weeks compared with a standard of care (SOC) using a collagen alginate dressing. The primary endpoint was percentage of wounds closed after 12 weeks. Secondary outcomes included assessments of complications, healing time, quality of life, and cost to closure. Forty patients were included in an intent-to-treat (ITT) and per-protocol (PP) analysis, with 39 completing the study protocol (n = 19 PRBM, n = 20 SOC). Wounds treated with PRBM were significantly more likely to close than wounds treated with SOC (ITT: 85% vs 30%, P = .0004, PP: 94% vs 30% P = .00008), healed significantly faster (mean 37 days vs 67 days for SOC, P = .002), and achieved a mean wound area reduction within 12 weeks of 96% vs 8.9% for SOC. No adverse events (AEs) directly related to PRBM treatment were reported. Mean PRBM cost of healing was $1731. Use of PRBM was safe and effective for treatment of chronic DFUs."
1144,Random forest regression evaluation model of regional flood disaster resilience based on the whale optimization algorithm,"Liu, Dong; Fan, Zhongrui; Fu, Qiang; Li, Mo; Faiz, Muhammad Abrar; Ali, Shoaib; Li, Tianxiao; Zhang, Liangliang; Khan, Muhammad Imran","This study proposes a flood disaster resilience evaluation model based on an improved random forest model, which is used to solve the fuzziness problem in resilience evaluations. The model uses the whale optimization algorithm (WOA) to determine the key parameters in the traditional random forest regression (RFR) model and combines the evaluation index set constructed by the Driving forces-Pressure-State-Impact-Response (DPSIR) model to output the resilience index of the study area. This approach has certain advantages in solving the spatiotemporal distribution problem of disaster resilience and can analyze the temporal and spatial variability of the research area and the key driving factors. Taking the Jiansanjiang Administration of Heilongjiang Province of China as an example, the model was used to analyze the resilience of flood disasters in 15 farms under the jurisdiction of the region from 2002 to 2016. The results showed that the level of resilience to flood disasters in the Jiansanjiang Administration was generally increasing at a growth rate of 4.175/10a. In addition, the level of flood resilience was spatially different as shown by the high level of resilience in the southwest and low level in the northeast. The degree of differentiation between farms increased between 2006 and 2011 and decreased between 2012 and 2016. The study also found that economic indicators and population indicators have a greater impact on the assessment results. Compared with the stochastic forest regression model optimized by particle swarm optimization (PSO-RFR) and the RFR model, the WOA-RFR model has outstanding advantages in fitting accuracy, generalization performance. The rationality coefficient and stability coefficient of the WOA-RFR are 0.964 and 0.976, respectively, which have reached a high level. The proposed WOA-RFR model can be used to perform regional disaster resilience evaluation, provide stable technical support and establish a scientific basis for regional disaster prevention and mitigation to ensure regional production safety and sustainable development.

1145,"Do foreign direct investments influence environmental degradation? Evidence from a panel autoregressive distributed lag model approach to low-, lower-middle-, upper-middle-, and high-income countries","Burcu Bahceci Baskurt,Saban Celik,Bora Aktan,Burcu Bahceci Baskurt,Saban Celik,Bora Aktan","The main aim of the present study is to examine the possible nonlinear relations between foreign direct investments and environmental deterioration for subpanels separated according to the income levels of countries by using the classification made by the World Bank. Total energy consumption, economic growth, and renewable energy share are also considered as determinants of environmental deterioration in the model. Cross-sectional dependence is observed; hence, appropriate panel data unit root and cointegration tests are utilized for which results pointed out mixed integration order. Pooled mean group (PMG) estimator panel auto-regressive distributed lag (ARDL, hereafter) approach is adapted to observe short- and long-run relationships between the variables. Long-run results supported the pollution haven hypothesis as foreign direct investments caused an increase in ecological footprint. Findings are sensitive to different income levels of the subpanels of countries. This empirical study suggests tailored policymaking for every income level subpanel to ensure sustainable development."
1146,Research on the performance of radiative cooling and solar heating coupling module to direct control indoor temperature,"Liu, Junwei; Zhou, Zhihua; Zhang, Debao; Jiao, Shifei; Zhang, Ji; Gao, Feng; Ling, Jihong; Feng, Wei; Zuo, Jian","The energy crisis and environmental pollution pose great challenges to human development. Traditional vapor-compression cooling consumes abundant energy and leads to a series of environmental problems. Radiative cooling without energy consumption and environmental pollution holds great promise as the next generation cooling technology, applied in buildings mostly in indirect way. In this work, a temperature-regulating module was introduced for direct summer cooling and winter heating. Firstly, the summer experiments were conduct to investigate the radiative cooling performance of the module. And the results indicated that the maximum indoor temperature reached only 27.5 degrees C with the ambient temperature of 34 degrees C in low latitude areas and the air conditioning system was on for only about a quarter of the day. Subsequently, the winter experiments were performed to explore the performance of the module in cooling and heating modes. The results indicated that indoor temperature can reach 25 degrees C in the daytime without additional heat supply and about a quarter of the day didn't require heating in winter. Additionally, the transient model of the module and the building revealed that the electricity saving of 42.4% (963.5 kWh) can be achieved in cooling season with the module, and that was 63.7% (1449.1 kWh) when coupling with energy storage system. Lastly, further discussion about the challenges and feasible solutions for radiative cooling to directly combine with the buildings were provided to advance the application of radiative cooling. Furthermore, with an acceptable payback period of 8 years, the maximum acceptable incremental cost reached 26.2 $/m(2). The work opens up a new avenue for the application mode of the daytime radiative cooling technology."
1147,COVID-19 and the UN Sustainable Development Goals: Threat to Solidarity or an Opportunity?,"Leal Filho, Walter; Brandli, Luciana Londero; Salvia, Amanda Lange; Rayman-Bacchus, Lez; Platje, Johannes","COVID-19, as a pandemic, is impacting institutions around the world. Its scope and economic dimensions also mean that it poses a major threat towards achieving the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). This article discusses how the coronavirus pandemic may influence the SDGs and could affect their implementation. The methods used entail an analysis of the literature, observations and an assessment of current world trends. The results obtained point out that, while COVID-19 has become a priority to many health systems in developing nations, they still need to attend to many other existing diseases such as malaria, yellow fever and others. Further, the study shows that strong concerns in dealing with COVID-19 are disrupting other disease prevention programs. As a result, problems such as mental health are also likely to be overlooked, since the isolation of social distancing may mask or lead to an increase in the percentage of suffers. The paper suggests that, due to its wide scope and areas of influence, COVID-19 may also jeopardize the process of the implementation of the SDGs. It sends a cautious warning about the need to continue to put an emphasis on the implementation of the SDGs, so that the progress achieved to date is not endangered."

However, little is published about these patterns in Japanese kelp species. In this study, we conducted phylogeographic analyses of a canopy-forming kelp, Eisenia bicyclis, based on genome-wide SNPs identified by ddRAD-seq. We obtained 1,299 SNPs for 76 samples from nine localities across the distribution. STRUCTURE, NeighborNet, and discriminant analysis of principal components consistently showed high genetic differentiation among the Eastern Pacific, Central Pacific, and Sea of Japan coastal regions. Relatively strong gene flow was detected only within populations in the Eastern Pacific and in the Sea of Japan. Genetic diversity and genetic uniqueness were high in the Central Pacific and low in the Sea of Japan. These results suggest that there were at least three independent refugia corresponding to the three regions during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). Furthermore, relatively larger populations in the Central Pacific and smaller populations in the Sea of Japan have been maintained in the demographic history from before the LGM to the present. These phylogeographic histories were supported by an Approximate Bayesian Computation analysis. From a conservation genetics perspective, the loss of southern populations in the Central Pacific would greatly reduce the total genetic diversity of the species. Southern populations in the Sea of Japan, which have relatively low genetic diversity, may be highly vulnerable to environmental change, such as heat waves and increased feeding. Therefore, careful monitoring and conservation are needed in the two regions."
1149,Influence of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Household Food Waste Behavior in Japan,"Qian, Kun; Javadi, Firouzeh; Hiramatsu, Michikazu","The 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic had various influences on people's ordinary lives, including their thoughts and behaviors related to food consumption. Food waste has been cited as a serious issue with environmental, social, and economic consequences. In this study, we investigated how the COVID-19 pandemic altered the social consciousness and behavior related to food waste in Japan. We conducted a nationwide online-based survey and collected a cross-sectional dataset from 1959 adult respondents. The results showed that people in regions highly impacted by the pandemic reported a clearer understanding of the situation of their household food waste, more careful food preparation and purchasing, and were more strongly influenced to change their behaviors due to COVID-19. Further analyses revealed that thoughts and behaviors related to food waste significantly differed by sociodemographic characteristics, such as gender, household size, and employment status. This study also implied that the COVID-19 pandemic encouraged some improvements in peoples' behaviors and thoughts with regard to food, such as paying attention to food waste, making efforts to reduce food waste, and attempting cooking by themselves at home."

A total of 1745 sheep were examined clinically and were selected from the suspected cases for laboratory investigation of skin scrapings for disease diagnosis. The examined animals included (509) Naimi, (396) Najdi, (518) Hurri, and (322) Rufidi native sheep. The results showed that the infestation rate was (12.77%) in all sheep. The highest strain was recorded (17.2%, 14.3%, 9.6%, and 8.6%), respectively. The infestation was highest in sheep over two years of age (15.2%) while it was lowest in sheep under two years of age (11.2 %). In addition, the infection rate in females was higher than in males. The prevalence of mange mites in females was (14%) compared to (11.2%) in males. The highest percentage of infestation was recorded in the head region at 67.2%, followed by that in the neck (4.4%), back (16.5%), tail (11.6%), and legs (0%). The presence of mange mites was discovered by microscopic examination of deep skin scrapings of infected animals that were identified morphologically. The infection was assured by histological investigations. This study revealed that mange mite is one of the most significant sheep health constraints in Riyadh. Therefore, proper prevention measures must be implemented to take into consideration other non-host-related risk factors."

Herein, a new strategy using monodispersed metal sites to tailor Pt-based nanocatalysts is addressed by engineering unconventional p-d orbital hybridization. Thus, monodispersed Ga on Pt3 Mn nanocrystals (Ga-O-Pt3 Mn) with high-indexed facets was constructed for the first time to drive ethanol electrooxidation reaction (EOR). Strikingly, the Ga-O-Pt3 Mn nanocatalyst shows an enhanced EOR performance with achieving 8.41 times of specific activity than that of Pt/C. The electrochemical in situ Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy results and theoretical calculations disclose that the Ga-O-Pt3 Mn nanocatalyst featuring an unconventional p-d orbital hybridization not only promote the C-C bond-breaking and rapid oxidation of -OH of ethanol, but also inhibit the generation of poisonous CO intermediate species. This work discloses a promising strategy to construct a novel nanocatalysts tailored by monodispersed metal site as efficient fuel cell catalysts."

W.","This work aims to improve the thermal and economic analysis of stepped double slope solar still (SDSSS) that integrated with linen wicks (LWs) and carbon black nanoparticles (CBNs). The LWs and CBNs were used to increase the evaporation surface area and enhance heat transfer of basin saline water. The SDSSS with LWs and LWs with CBNs were evaluated, and compared with traditional solar still (TSS). The energy and exergy for convection and evaporation and exergy efficiency for different modifications were analyzed, and its costs were discussed. Results indicated that adding LWs and CBNs to SDSSS increased the freshwater productivity and energy efficiency by 80.57 and 110.5%, respectively, compared to TSS. The SDSSS fractional exergy of evaporation was the highest in the case of integrating LWs and CBNs with the solar still due to the high basin water temperature. This modification caused the highest exergy efficiency for SDSSS because of enhanced photothermal properties of CBNs, and heat storage characteristic of LWs. Economic analysis indicated that the total costs per liter of produced freshwater for SDSSS without any modifications, SDSSS with LWs, SDSSS with CBNs, and SDSSS with LWs and CBNs were lower than TSS by 13.73, 19.91, 23.83, and 47.22%, respectively."

Seventy five percent of primary cardiac tumours are benign tumours. Cardiac tumours present with a range of obstructive, embolic, arrhythmic or systemic symptoms, and in many cases may present asymptomatically. The clinical presentation depends largely on the size and location of the mass. With advances in cardiac imagining and the introduction of cardiopulmonary bypass, the diagnosis and surgical treatment of these rare tumours has improved the prognosis and outlook for benign and malignant tumours. Management depends on tumour histology, size and location as well as the clinical presentation. Conservative management is reserved for small, benign tumours that can undergo regular echocardiographic follow-up. Symptomatic benign tumours are treated with surgical resection and the results are excellent. Malignant primary cardiac tumours have a poor prognosis with high rates of relapse and a median survival of 10-24 months."

There is a substantial body of work investigating the chemoreception and chemical ecology of Diptera (flies) and Lepidoptera (moths and butterflies); but less is known about the Orthoptera (grasshoppers, locusts, crickets, and wēta). Within the Orthoptera, the family Acrididae contains about 6700 species of short-horned grasshoppers. Grasshoppers are fascinating organisms to study due to their significant taxonomic and ecological divergence, however, most chemoreception and chemical ecology studies have focused on locusts because they are agricultural pests (e.g., Schistocerca gregaria and Locusta migratoria). Here we review studies of chemosensory systems and chemical ecology of all short-horned grasshoppers. Applications of genome editing tools and entomopathogenic microorganism to control locusts in association with their chemical ecology are also discussed. Finally, we identify gaps in the current knowledge and suggest topics of interest for future studies."
1155,A ratiometric fluorescent nanoprobe for signal amplification monitoring of intracellular telomerase activity,"Dandan Ma,Huiyun Bai,Junbo Li,Yintao Li,Lihua Song,Jinping Zheng,Congxiu Miao,Dandan Ma,Huiyun Bai,Junbo Li,Yintao Li,Lihua Song,Jinping Zheng,Congxiu Miao","Telomerase is considered a valuable diagnostic and prognostic cancer biomarker. Accurate and reliable detection of telomerase activity is of great value in clinical diagnosis, screening of inhibitors, and therapeutics. Here, we developed a novel amplified fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) nanoprobe for highly sensitive and reliable monitoring of intracellular telomerase activity. The nanoprobe (QDSA@DNA) was composed of a streptavidin-modified quantum dot (QDSA) which was functionalized with a telomerase primer sequence (TP) and Cy5-tagged signal switching sequence (SS) through biotin-streptavidin interaction. When the nanoprobe was assembled, the Cy5 was in close proximity to the QDSA, resulting in high FRET efficiency from the QDSA to Cy5. In the presence of telomerase, the TP could be extended to produce telomeric repeat units, which was complementary to the loop of SS. Thus, the SS could hybridize with elongated sequences to form a rigid double-stranded structure, which forced the Cy5 away from the surface of the QDSA, causing low FRET efficiency. Furthermore, due to the production of multiple repeat units by telomerase, multiple hairpin structures could be opened, yielding significant fluorescence ratio (FQDsa/FCy5) enhancement for sensing of telomerase activity. In this way, the combination of a FRET and target-assisted strategy in a nanoprobe improved the detection accuracy and amplified the detection signal, respectively. The QDSA@DNA nanoprobe also showed high selectivity, excellent nuclease stability, and good biocompatibility. More importantly, this nanoprobe was found to be an excellent platform for efficient monitoring of intracellular telomerase activity, providing a potential platform in tumor diagnosis and screening of telomerase-related inhibitors."
1156,Sizing renewable energy systems with energy storage systems in microgrids for maximum cost-efficient utilization of renewable energy resources,"Al-Ghussain, Loiy; Samu, Remember; Taylan, Onur; Fahrioglu, Murat","The hybridization of renewable energy systems (RES) and further integrating them with Energy Storage Systems (ESS) can help improve the RESs' reliability and reduce the mismatch between energy consumption and generation profiles. The main aim of this study is to suggest a sizing methodology for the RES components with various ESS scenarios in a microgrid through techno-economic feasibility analysis. Although the suggested methodology is flexible to include several RESs and ESSs, the methodology is demonstrated to compare the techno-economic performance of Wind and Photovoltaic (PV) energy systems under four different ESS scenarios; (i) no ESS, (ii) Pumped Hydro Storage (PHS), (iii) Hydrogen Fuel Cell (HFC), and (iv) hybrid ESS (PHS/HFC). The optimal RES configuration is determined by maximizing the RES fraction while equating the Cost of Electricity (COE) to the national utility tariff. However, in the event that there is no feasible system configuration that satisfies the mentioned criteria, the main objective becomes maximizing the RES fraction at the lowest attainable COE. This study outlines that the incorporation of PHS and HFC with the PV/Wind hybrid system increased the demand-supply fraction from 46.5%-89.4% and the RES fraction from 62.6%-91.8% with COE equals to 0.175 USD/kWh."
1157,The role of ICT in energy consumption and environment: an empirical investigation of Asian economies with cluster analysis,"Arshad, Zeeshan; Robaina, Margarita; Botelho, Anabela","The development of societies has led information and communication technology (ICT) to play a gradually important role in people's lives, transforming the way societies and economies function. ICTs are often associated with the path to reducing CO(2)emissions; however, do they lead to that path? Or are they themselves a growing source of energy consumption and emissions? The current study estimates the effect of ICT, trade, economic growth, financial development, and energy consumption on carbon emissions in South and Southeast Asian (SSEA) region for the period of 1990-2014. Moreover, the study also tried to validate the environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) hypothesis between GDP per capita and CO(2)emissions. Cluster analysis was used to identify two groups (potential and advanced countries) based on their social development score. The long-run connection between the variables was examined and the long-run elasticities of ICT, financial development, energy consumption, trade, and economic growth with respect to CO(2)emissions were estimated. Besides, individual country-wise long-run coefficients were found. Results show that financial development and ICT deteriorated the environment quality in the SSEA region, suggesting ICT goods and services are not energy-efficient in both potential and advanced countries and that most of the financial investment was made in non-friendly environmental projects, in potential countries. On the contrary, in advanced countries, financial development mitigates CO(2)emissions. In addition, results also confirmed an inverted U-shaped relationship for all the considered three panels such as potential, advance, and full-countries panels, confirming EKC. Causality findings showed a bidirectional causality between CO(2)emissions and energy consumption as well as unidirectional causality from trade, economic growth, financial development, and ICT to CO(2)emissions. Policymakers should be aware of the ICT impact on energy consumption and strengthen the regulation of their manufacture to facilitate the integration of energy efficiency into user routines. Due to the increasing use of standby mode and Wi-Fi assistive devices, the rapid implementation of legislation regulating these technologies to make them more efficient is recommended."

Multidisciplinary management, early recognition of potential complications, specialised care of medications and intra-operative protection of the vulnerable brain are all important aspects of the peri-operative management of patients with Parkinson's disease. Advances in continuous dopaminergic treatment, development of a peri-operative Parkinson's disease pathway and application of telemedicine are starting to play a role in improving peri-operative care. Management of patients with advanced Parkinson's disease is also evolving, with potential for incorporation of integrated care and changes in the anaesthetic management for deep brain stimulation surgery. There are new methods for localisation of target nuclei and increasing insight on the effects of anaesthetic drugs on microelectrode recordings and clinical outcomes. Parkinson's disease is a progressive disease, but management is improving with better peri-operative care for patients."

The heat enhancement has been shown to saturate at increasing concentrations. Experiments were performed to empirically model the saturating heating effects during focused ultrasound.Materials and methods: The measurements were made at varying concentrations using magnetic resonance thermometry and focused ultrasound by circulating droplets of mean diameter 1.9 to 2.3 µm through a perfused phantom. A simulation was performed to estimate the interaction radius size, empirically.Results: The interaction radius, representing the radius of a sphere encompassing 90% of the probability for the transformation of acoustic energy into heat deposition around a single droplet, was determined experimentally from ultrasonic absorption coefficient measurements The simulations suggest the interaction radius was approximately 12.5-fold larger than the geometrical radius of droplets, corresponding to an interaction volume on the order of 2000 larger than the geometrical volume.Conclusions: The results provide information regarding the dose-response relationship from the droplets, a measure with 15% precision of their interaction radii with focused ultrasound, and subsequent insights into the underlying physical heating mechanism."

1161,Effects of the socio-economic influencing factors on SO2 pollution in Chinese cities: A spatial econometric analysis based on satellite observed data,"Jiang, Lei; He, Shixiong; Cui, Yuanzheng; Zhou, Haifeng; Kong, Hao","The research on SO2 pollution in China has been hotly debated over the past decades. Different from the existing studies, this work employs satellite observed SO2 columns from 2005 to 2016 and applies a spatial econometric approach to investigate the socio-economic influencing factors of SO2 pollution of 270 prefecture-level cities in China. The findings are as follows. (1) SO2 pollution over China exhibits a significant and positive spatial autocorrelation. (2) The most polluted area is concentrated on the North China Plain. However, SO2 pollution over China has been reduced gradually during the sample period, implying that overall environmental quality in China has been substantially improved. (3) Besides, the results of spatial econometric models are not in support of ""pollution haven hypothesis"". On the contrary, the pollution halo effect of foreign direct investment works well and contributes to reducing SO2 pollution in China. Moreover, we find that urban economic levels and innovative capability are negatively correlated with SO2 pollution, indicating that economic growth and an increase in innovation can help improve environmental quality. On contrast, the share of the secondary industry, urbanization and transportation are found to have positive impacts, indicating that they are three main contributors to SO2 pollution in China."
1162,Optimal sizing of wind/ concentrated solar plant/ electric heater hybrid renewable energy system based on two-stage stochastic programming,"Li, Rong; Guo, Su; Yang, Yong; Liu, Deyou","Component capacity and energy management strategy are two key issues for the optimal sizing of a hybrid renewable energy system. In this study, a two-stage stochastic programming problem is proposed for the optimal sizing of a hybrid renewable energy system consisted of wind turbine, concentrated solar plant, and electric heater. In the problem, component capacity optimization is the first-stage problem to minimize the levelized cost of energy while satisfying the reliability constraint, and energy management strategy optimization is the second-stage problem to minimize the loss of power supply probability while satisfying the operation constraints. The problem is solved by combining of an improved differential evolution algorithm, namely JADE, and Cplex, and the superiority of JADE is validated by algorithm comparisons with several popular intelligent optimization algorithms. Furthermore, economic benefits of the electric heater in the hybrid system are investigated by techno-economic comparisons with a reference wind turbine/concentrated solar plant hybrid energy system without electric heater under their optimal capacity. The results show the electric heater is beneficial for a lower levelized cost of energy, reducing by 0.004 ($/kWh) and 0.009 ($/kWh) respectively when the loss of power supply probability is 2% and 5%.

Methods: A method for the ultrasound-assisted fabrication of protein-modified nanosized graphene oxide-like carbon-based nanoparticles (CBNPs) was developed. After being modified with bovine serum albumin (BSA), CUR was loaded onto the synthesized hybrid (labeled CBNPs@BSA-CUR). The structure and properties of the synthesized nanoparticles were elucidated using transmission electron microscopy (TEM), atomic force microscopy (AFM), ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy (UV-Vis), Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) methods. Results: CBNPs@BSA-CUR showed pH sensitivity and were calculated as controlled CUR release behavior. The drug-free system exhibited good biocompatibility and was nontoxic. However, CBNPs@BSA-CUR showed acceptable antiproliferative ability against MCF-7 breast cancer cells. Conclusion: CBNPs@BSA-CUR could be considered a highly promising nontoxic nanocarrier for the delivery of CUR with good biosafety."
1164,A deep learning-based forecasting model for renewable energy scenarios to guide sustainable energy policy: A case study of Korea,"Nam, KiJeon; Hwangbo, Soonho; Yoo, ChangKyoo","Renewable and sustainable energy systems and policies have globally been promoted to transition from fossil fuel sources to environmentally friendly renewable energy sources such as wind power, photovoltaic energy, and fuel cells. Wind and solar energy sources are erratic and difficult to implement in renewable energy systems, therefore, circumspection is needed to implement such renewable energy systems and policies. Accordingly, this study develops an energy forecasting model with renewable energy technologies on which policy can be based, using the Korean energy policy as a case study. Deep learning-based models forecast fluctuating variation in electricity demand and generation, which are necessary in renewable energy system but not possible with conventional models. The gated recurrent unit shows the best prediction performance among the forecasting models evaluated, and is therefore selected as the base model to evaluate four different renewable energy scenarios. The scenarios are evaluated according to economic-environmental cost assessment. The optimal scenario uses an integrated gasification combined cycle, onshore and offshore wind farms, photovoltaic power stations, and fuel cell plants; in particular, this scenario shows the lowest economic-environmental costs, generates stable electricity for demand, and achieves a policy with 100% renewable energy. The optimal scenario is assessed by considering its strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats analysis while also considering technoeconomic-environmental domestic and global energy circumstances."

However, oil contaminated environment is enriched with microorganisms that can utilize petroleum oil and use hydrocarbon for their growth, nutrition and metabolic activities. In the present study, bacteria present in the oil contaminated soil were isolated by enrichment culture technique using Minimal Salt (MS) media supplemented with diesel oil and burned engine oil as a sole carbon source. The isolated bacteria were characterized by morphological and biochemical tests and identified by molecular tool through cycle sequencing method. Three isolates were morphologically characterized as gram-negative, cocci shaped and 16S rRNA sequence analysis revealed that the isolates are closely related to Pseudomonas sp., Acinetobacter sp., and Enterobacter sp. respectively. Growth condition was optimized at pH 7.0 and temperature 37 °C. All the isolates were susceptible to several antibiotics and they have no antagonistic effect with soil beneficial bacteria. Three isolates were grown in two different concentrations of diesel oil and burned engine oil (4% v/v and 8%, v/v) respectively. Study revealed that with increasing the concentration of diesel oil in the media the growth rate of all the isolates were decreased. In contrast, the growth rates of all the three isolates were increased, with increasing concentration of burned engine oil. In our study, all the isolates showed their degradation efficacy in 4% v/v diesel oil and in 8% v/v burned engine oil. So, our research clearly shows that the isolates could be potentially used for bioremediation purposes for cleaning up petroleum polluted area."
1166,The Relationship between Economic Growth and Air Pollution-A Regional Comparison between China and South Korea,"Jiang, Min; Kim, Euijune; Woo, Youngjin","This paper analyzes the interaction between regional economic growth and air pollution in China and Korea. The relationship between gross regional product per capita and industrial emission of sulfur dioxide emission is examined at the regional level using simultaneous equation models covering 286 cities in China and 228 cities and counties in South Korea of the period 2006-2016. The results find that regional differences existed in the relationship between air pollution and economic growth in two countries. In both countries, an inverted U-shaped pattern was found in metropolitan areas while a U-shaped pattern of non-metropolitan areas. Although the emissions of pollutants in metropolitan areas of both countries have shown a downward trend in recent years, there is still a large gap between the overall emission levels of China and South Korea. Moreover, the level of pollutant emissions of China's metropolitan areas is much higher than in non-metropolitan areas, while the opposite result has occurred in Korea. In China, there was an inverted U-shaped relationship of the eastern and northwest region, while U-shaped relationships existed in the southwest, central and northeast regions."
1167,Globalization-driven CO2 emissions in Singapore: an application of ARDL approach,"Mehmood, Usman","This study explores the linkage between globalization and CO2 emissions in Singapore by using long-term data obtained during 1970-2014. The Zivot-Andrew unit root test corroborates that gross domestic production, economic globalization, political globalization, social globalization, square of economic growth, and carbon dioxide emissions have a unit root at I(0) and stationary at I(1). In this study, the application of auto-regressive distributed lag model finds a significant linkage between the estimated variables. Short- and long-run coefficients confirm that social globalization and economic globalization will be responsible for reduction in carbon dioxide emissions in the future for Singapore. Moreover, this research confirms the presence of environmental Kuznets curve in Singapore. It is proved that a 1% increase in political globalization will increase 2.06% emissions in the long term. The stability of the model is confirmed by diagnostic tests. In addition, policy implications to reduce air pollution are presented in this study."
1168,"The distribution, characteristics and ecological risks of microplastics in the mangroves of Southern China","Li, Ruili; Yu, Lingyun; Chai, Minwei; Wu, Hailun; Zhu, Xiaoshan","During the production, use and disposal of plastic products, microplastics (MPs) are dispersed into the surrounding environment and have inevitable impacts on mangrove ecosystems in estuaries and offshore areas. In the mangroves of Southern China, the systematic evaluation of the distribution, characteristics and ecological risks of MPs is lacking. In this study, surface sediments (0-5 cm depth) were collected from six representative mangroves in China to explore MP contamination and its associated ecological risk. Based on the results, MP concentrations of MPs in mangrove sediments were as follows: FT (2249 +/- 747 items/kg), ZJ (736 +/- 269 items/kg), DF (649 +/- 443 items/kg), DZG (431 +/- 170 items/kg), YX (424 +/- 127 items/kg), and FCG (227 +/- 173 items/kg). The higher MP concentration in the Futian mangrove was mainly related to inputs from the Pearl River, the third largest river in China. The predominant shape, colour, and size of MPs were fibrous, white-transparent, and 500-5000 mu m, respectively. The main MP polymer types were polypropylene, polyethylene, and polystyrene. Degradation artefacts were present on surface of MPs as well as metallic and non-metallic elements. MPs concentration in mangrove sediments increased with increasing social-economic development of surrounding districts, which indicated the clear influence of anthropogenic activity on MP pollution in these mangroves. Furthermore, total organic carbon (TOC) and silt content were positively associated with MPs (P < 0.01), indicating a facilitatory role in deposition of MPs in mangroves. Based on a comprehensive evaluation using the potential ecological risk factor (E-i), potential ecological risk (RI), polymer risk index (H) and pollution load index (PLI), MPs were found to present ecological risks in these mangroves, with the highest risk occurring in the Futian mangrove.

We report a case of a 70-year-old male who presented with an anterior ST-elevation myocardial infarction. Coronary angiogram revealed a proximal left anterior descending (LAD) artery occlusion. Successful PCI was performed with stenting of the LAD. However, subsequent attempts to retrieve a jailed diagonal branch inadvertently led to distal coronary perforation of the LAD. After failed attempts to tamponade the perforation with prolonged balloon inflation, this was successfully sealed with the MicroVascular Plug (Medtronic) system. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of such an application in the coronary system. This may prove to be a viable alternative in closure of distal coronary perforations."
1170,Mental Health and Work Attitudes among People Resuming Work during the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Cross-Sectional Study in China,"Song, Lili; Wang, Yong; Li, ZhengLin; Yang, Ying; Li, Hao","The unprecedented outbreak of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused an economic downturn and increased the unemployment rate in China. In this context, employees face health and social economic stressors. To assess their mental health (i.e., anxiety, depression, insomnia and somatization) and work attitudes (i.e., work engagement, job satisfaction and turnover intention) as well as the associated factors, we conducted a cross-sectional study among people who resumed work after the Spring Festival holiday during the COVID-19 pandemic. The results show that the prevalence of anxiety, depression, insomnia and somatization among these people was 12.7%, 13.5%, 20.7% and 6.6%, respectively. The major risk factor for mental health was worrying about unemployment, and the main protective factors were psychological strengths (i.e., resilience and optimism). Regarding work attitudes, the percentage of people who felt more satisfied with their job (43.8%) was larger than that of those who felt less satisfied (26.9%), while the percentage of people who thought about quitting their job more frequently (15.7%) was smaller than that of those who considered it less frequently (63.2%). However, work engagement was lower than usual. Similar to the factors associated with mental health, the major risk factor for work attitudes was also worrying about unemployment, and the main protective factors were resilience and optimism. In addition, the nature of the organization, job status, age, position and income changes were also related to these work attitudes. Our findings shed light on the need for organization administrators to be aware of the status of and factors associated with employees' mental health and work attitudes during the COVID-19 pandemic. Policies or interventions could be developed based on our findings."

Metakaolin which is commonly used as an admixture or partial replacement of cement owing to its most effective pozzolanic properties, which improve the microstructure and strengthen the mechanical and durability properties of cement concrete, has been investigated as a precursor in geopolymer concrete. Several studies have been conducted to comprehend the effect of metakaolin as an additive in geopolymer mortar and concrete prepared with various aluminosilicate sources as precursors such as fly ash and rice husk ash to enhance geopolymerization, densify microstructure, and elevate durability. The present paper recapitulates these investigations primarily concentrating on the various properties of metakaolin-based concrete. The effect of various factors such as alkali content, solids/liquids ratio, alkali reactant ratio, molar ratio, water content, and curing regime has been compiled. Most of them revealed that metakaolin is used as a precursor and yields better geopolymer products. XRD studies reported the peaks demonstrating the development of enhancement in hydration products in comparison to other precursors. Examination of SEM graphs reveals that the addition of a smaller quantity of silica-rich materials densifies the microstructure of geopolymers and produces higher mechanical strength. Durability studies reveal that metakaolin geopolymers possess better water resistance, thermal resistance, and anti-corrosion properties. The possible applications of metakaolin-based geopolymeric materials are also pointed out. The comprehensive knowledge presented here is expected to support the prospective researchers to decide their future course of the research area. Graphical abstract."

The present research work aims to experimentally investigate the effect of a V-shape concentrator integrated with solar still (SS). The V-shape concentrator integrated with the conventional solar still (CSS) is used to supply the saline water at elevated temperature to the basin of SS, which augments the freshwater yield compared to CSS. The experimental investigation was performed at different brackish water depths of 0.01, 0.02, and 0.03 m, respectively. The SS system was evaluated based on water yield, energy, exergy, concentrator efficiency, and economic analysis. The freshwater yield of the solar still integrated with V-shape concentrator (SSVC) was found to be 5.47, 5.10, and 4.89 L/m(2).day, whereas the yield of the CSS was 3.73, 3.27, and 2.91 L/m(2).day at the water depths of 0.01, 0.02, and 0.03 m, respectively. The daily energy and exergy efficiency of CSS were 38.5, 33.5, and 29.4% and 1.9, 1.5, and 0.97 % in the case of 0.01, 0.02, and 0.03m water depth , respectively. However, the integration of concentrator significantly augmented the energy efficiency to 57.4, 51.7, and 44.9% and exergy efficiency to 3.8, 3.3, and 2.8% for the respective water depths . Life cycle studies demonstrated that the freshwater cost per liter for CSS and SSVC were 0.0102 $ and 0.0117 $ respectively, at a water depth of 0.01 m. It was concluded that the addition of V-shape concentrator and minimum water depth is useful to augment the energy efficiency, exergy efficiency, and yield of the SS in the very economical way."
1173,A comparative techno-economic assessment of biochar production from different residue streams using conventional and microwave pyrolysis,"Haeldermans, T.; Campion, L.; Kuppens, T.; Vanreppelen, K.; Cuypers, A.; Schreurs, S.","A comparative techno-economic assessment and Monte Carlo risk analysis is performed on large scale (3 tonne/ h) biochar production plants for conventional (CPS) and microwave (MWP) pyrolysis using six different residue streams. Both plants are viable with minimum selling prices between Euro 436/tonne and Euro 863/tonne for CPS, and between Euro 564/tonne and Euro 979/tonne for MWP. The CPS is therefore more viable than MWP as it is a simpler and more established technology. However, a 20% biochar price increase due to higher biochar quality makes the MWP technology more viable. Nevertheless, the discounted payback period remains higher than this of CPS due to the increased CAPEX. Biochar price is the most important determinant of a biochar production plant's feasibility, motivating the need for economic and market research on biochar prices in function of biochar characteristics to reduce fluctuations in widely varying biochar prices."

Among two nitrogen atoms, one of which carries with a hydrogen atom is a pyrrole-type nitrogen atom, another is a pyridine type nitrogen atom. Hence, the imidazole ring belongs to the π electron-rich aromatic ring and can accept strong suction to the electronic group. Moreover, the nitrogen atom of the imidazole ring is coordinated with metal ions to form metal-organic frameworks. In recent years, because of imidazole compounds' unique optical properties, their applications have attracted more and more attention in optical analysis. Thus, this review has summarized the synthesis, characterization, and application with emphasis on the research progress of imidazole compounds in optical analysis, including fluorescence probe, colorimetric probe, electrochemiluminescence sensor, fiber optical sensor, surface plasmon resonance, etc. This paper will suggest the direction for the development of imidazole-containing sensors with high sensitivity and selectivity."
1175,"Relationship between greenhouse gas emission, energy consumption, and economic growth: evidence from some selected oil-producing African countries","Yusuf, Abdulmalik M.; Abubakar, Attahir Babaji; Mamman, Suleiman O.","This paper investigates the relationship between greenhouse gas emissions, energy consumption, and output growth among African OPEC countries (Libya, Nigeria, Angola, Algeria, Equatorial Guinea, and Gabon) using the panel autoregressive distributed lag model (PARDL) estimated by means of mean group (MG) and pooled mean group (PMG) for the period 1970-2016. The paper estimated three panel models comprising the components of greenhouse gasses which includes nitrous oxide, carbon dioxide (CO2), and methane and examined their relationship with economic growth and energy consumption. The findings of the study showed evidence of a positive impact of economic growth on both CO2 and methane emissions in the long run. Its impact on nitrous oxide emissions although positive was found to be statistically insignificant. Energy consumption was also found to produce an insignificant positive impact on CO2, methane, and nitrous oxide emissions in the long run. In the short run, economic growth exerts a significant positive effect on methane emissions; however, its effect on CO2 and nitrous oxide emissions although positive was found to be statistically insignificant. Energy consumption produces an insignificant impact on all components of greenhouse gasses in the short run. In addition, our empirical results showed the presence of a non-linear relationship between methane emissions and economic growth, confirming the existence of the environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) only in the case of methane emissions model."

We introduce some innovative factors such as financial development, human capital, renewable energy consumption, and gross domestic product as determinants of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. The empirical estimations are based on Pesaran (2007) unit root test, common correlated effect mean group, and augmented mean group. The findings reveal a positive relationship between carbon emissions and financial development as well as a gross domestic product. In contrast, technological innovation and renewable energy consumption are adversely related to carbon emissions. These findings have important implications, and we recommend the promotion of technological innovation and the use of renewable energy consumption. This will help in achieving the goals set by COP21."
1177,A supply curve of electricity-based hydrogen in a decarbonized European energy system in 2050,"Lux, Benjamin; Pfluger, Benjamin","Alongside substituting fossil fuels with renewable energies and increasing energy efficiency, the utilization of electricity-based hydrogen or its derived synthetic fuels is a potential strategy to meet ambitious European climate protection targets. As synthetic hydrocarbons have the same chemical properties as their fossil substitutes, existing infrastructures and well-established application technologies can be retained while CO2 emissions in energy conversion, transport, industry, and residential and services can be reduced. However, the conversion processes, especially the generation of hydrogen necessary for all e-fuels, are associated with energy losses and costs. To evaluate the techno-economic hydrogen production potential and the impact of its utilization on the rest of the energy system, a supply curve of electricity-based hydrogen in a greenhouse gas emission-free European energy system in 2050 was developed. It was found that hydrogen quantities of the order of magnitude envisaged in the 1.5 degrees C scenarios by the European Commission's long-term strategic vision (1536-1953 TWh(H2)) induce marginal hydrogen production costs of over 110 (sic)(2020)/MWh(H2) and electrolyzer capacities of more than 615 GW(el). Although the generation of these amounts of hydrogen using electrolysis provides some flexibility to the electricity system and can integrate small amounts of local surplus electricity, an additional 766 GWel of wind power and 865 GWel of solar power must be installed to cover the additional electricity demand for hydrogen production. It was furthermore found that the most important techno-economic properties of electrolyzers used in an energy system dominated by renewable energies are the ability to operate flexibly and the conversion efficiency of electricity into hydrogen. It is anticipated that the shown analysis is valuable for both policy-makers, who need to identify research, subsidy and infrastructure requirements for a future energy system, and corporate decision-makers, whose business models will be significantly affected by the future availability of electricity-based fuels."

Waste heat recovery technology is an effective method to improve the fuel economy of ships and help the future ships to meet the increasingly stringent Energy Efficiency Design Index of the International Maritime Organization. Under the thermodynamic analysis results of the 8S90ME-C10.2 low-speed marine diesel engine, this paper proposed a waste heat recovery scheme that combined the supercritical carbon dioxide Brayton cycle power generation system with the Kalina cycle power generation system. According to the energy and exergy balances of the combined cycle system, a MATLAB program based on the REFPROP database was established. With the application of control variate method, the influence of the key operating parameters including the main compressor inlet temperature, the turbine inlet temperature, the main compressor outlet pressure, the expander inlet pressure, and the ammonia solution mass concentration on the system performance was thoroughly analyzed. Moreover, the multi-objective optimization matching between the diesel engine and the combined power generation system was carried out from the viewpoints of the thermodynamic performance and economic performance and the impact of the system on the fuel economy and the Energy Efficiency Design Index of the ship was calculated. The results showed that the combined power generation system was used to recycle the waste heat of diesel engine exhaust gas and bypass exhaust gas to generate electricity, which reduced the annual fuel consumption and the Energy Efficiency Design Index to 16.62% and 15.01%, respectively. Finally, this study provides a reference for researchers to study the combined use of supercritical carbon dioxide Brayton cycle and Kalina cycle to recycle the waste heat of the marine diesel engine."
1179,Role of necroptosis of alveolar macrophages in acute lung inflammation of mice exposed to titanium dioxide nanoparticles,"Tomoya Sagawa,Akiko Honda,Raga Ishikawa,Natsuko Miyasaka,Megumi Nagao,Sakiko Akaji,Takashi Kida,Takahiro Tsujikawa,Tatsushi Yoshida,Yutaka Kawahito,Hirohisa Takano,Tomoya Sagawa,Akiko Honda,Raga Ishikawa,Natsuko Miyasaka,Megumi Nagao,Sakiko Akaji,Takashi Kida,Takahiro Tsujikawa,Tatsushi Yoshida,Yutaka Kawahito,Hirohisa Takano","Titanium dioxide (TiO2) nanoparticles are indispensable for daily life but induce acute inflammation, mainly via inhalation exposure. TiO2 nanoparticles can be phagocytosed by alveolar macrophages (AMs) in vivo and cause necroptosis of exposed cells in vitro. However, the relationship between localization of TiO2 nanoparticles in the lungs after exposure and their biological responses including cell death and inflammation remains unclear. This study was conducted to investigate the intra/extracellular localization of TiO2 nanoparticles in murine lungs at 24 h after intratracheal exposure to rutile TiO2 nanoparticles and subsequent local biological reactions, specifically necroptosis of AMs and lung inflammation. We found that TiO2 exposure induced leukocyte migration into the alveolar region and increased the secretion of C-C motif ligand (CCL) 3 in the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid. A combination of Raman spectroscopy and staining of cell and tissue samples confirmed that AMs phagocytose TiO2. AMs that phagocytosed TiO2 nanoparticles showed necroptosis, characterized by the expression of phosphorylated mixed lineage kinase domain-like protein and translocation of high mobility group box-1 from the cell nucleus to the cytoplasm. In primary cultured AMs, TiO2 also induced necroptosis and increased the secretion of CCL3. Necroptosis inhibitors suppressed the increase in CCL3 secretion in both the BAL fluid and culture supernatant of AMs and suppressed the increase in leukocytes in the BAL fluid.

1181,Optimisation of a hydrogen production - storage - re-powering system participating in electricity and transportation markets. A case study for Denmark,"Apostolou, Dimitrios","The power capacity of renewable energy sources is constantly increasing through the installation of new units, primarily comprising the most mature technologies such as wind and solar energy converters, as well as through the implementation of innovative technologies that are currently at an infant stage of development. The aim of this study was to investigate the prospects of implementing hydrogen technologies in the electricity network as an electricity production unit or/and utilise the produced hydrogen as transportation fuel. Three main scenarios were identified to be the most appropriate for this: (1) Support of the electrical grid via a fuel cell; (2) participation of a hydrogen production and fuel cell system in the electricity and transportation markets; and (3) participation in the transportation market. The results indicated that a fuel cell generator providing ancillary services is not economically viable in the investigated case study, while implementing a hydrogen production unit with a hydrogen fuel selling price between 4 and 114 (sic)/kgH(2), depending on the electrolyser's power input, will yield positive results. For the third scenario, the hydrogen fuel price ranged between 3.6 and 15.0 (sic)/kgH(2). This research shows that hydrogen technologies can be used in the electricity and transportation markets from a technical point of view. However, from an economic point of view, a hydrogen system used only for a single application does not seem to be financially appealing. This suggests that reducing the investment cost and/or limiting operating costs is mandatory to support this type of investment."

Such undesired environmental outcomes may be mitigated by utilizing biological agents as part of farming practice. The present review article summarizes the analyses of the current status of global agriculture and soil scenarios; a description of the role of earthworms and their products as better biofertilizer; and suggestions for the rejuvenation of such technology despite significant lapses and gaps in research and extension programs. By maintaining a close collaboration with farmers, we have recognized a shift in their attitude and renewed optimism toward nature-based green technology. Based on these relations, it is inferred that the application of earthworm-mediated vermitechnology increases sustainable development by strengthening the underlying economic, social and ecological framework.

1183,History of GH treatment in Japan,"Toshiaki Tanaka,Toshiaki Tanaka","In Japan, a pituitary-extracted human GH (phGH), Crescormon®, was approved for the treatment of pituitary dwarfism in 1975. The Study Group of Pituitary Dysfunction was organized by the Ministry of Health and Welfare (MHW) in 1973 and prepared the ""Diagnostic Handbook: Pituitary Dwarfism"" guidelines in 1974. Eligibility assessments for phGH treatment were conducted by the research group on pituitary dwarfism (later the Foundation for Growth Science [FGS] GH Treatment Eligibility Assessment Committee); however, there were 200-300 patients on the waiting list. GH treatment has been financially supported by the Grant-in-Aid Program for Chronic Diseases in Childhood, MHW, since 1974. In 1984, phGH was discontinued in the United States due to reports of the onset of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in patients treated with phGH. Japan approved the use of methionyl hGH in 1986 and recombinant hGH in 1988. As a result, the phGH disappeared from the market. The role of the Eligibility Assessment Committee of the FGS shifted to the provision of second opinions about diagnoses and treatment appropriateness. Since then, the indications for GH treatment of pediatric growth disorders have expanded to include other pediatric growth disorders such as Turner syndrome, achondroplasia/hypochondroplasia, etc."
1184,Quantifying the dynamics of nearly 100 years of dominance hierarchy research,"Elizabeth A Hobson,Elizabeth A Hobson","Dominance hierarchies have been studied for almost 100 years. The science of science approach used here provides high-level insight into how the dynamics of dominance hierarchy research have shifted over this long timescale. To summarize these patterns, I extracted publication metadata using a Google Scholar search for the phrase 'dominance hierarchy', resulting in over 26 000 publications. I used text mining approaches to assess patterns in three areas: (1) general patterns in publication frequency and rate, (2) dynamics of term usage and (3) term co-occurrence in publications across the history of the field. While the overall number of publications per decade continues to rise, the percent growth rate has fallen in recent years, demonstrating that although there is sustained interest in dominance hierarchies, the field is no longer experiencing the explosive growth it showed in earlier decades. Results from title term co-occurrence networks and community structure show that the different subfields of dominance hierarchy research were most strongly separated early in the field's history while modern research shows more evidence for cohesion and a lack of distinct term community boundaries. These methods provide a general view of the history of research on dominance hierarchies and can be applied to other fields or search terms to gain broad synthetic insight into patterns of interest, especially in fields with large bodies of literature. This article is part of the theme issue 'The centennial of the pecking order: current state and future prospects for the study of dominance hierarchies'."
1185,Working from home during the corona-crisis is associated with higher subjective well-being for women with long (pre-corona) commutes,"Maarten Kroesen,Maarten Kroesen","Much research has been devoted to assessing the effect of commute duration on the subjective well-being of people, but as of yet, the respective body or research has been inconclusive as to whether there is indeed a (large) negative effect or not. To control the spread of COVID-19 governments around the world have taken unprecedented measures to control the outbreak of the Corona-virus. Forcing or strongly advising people to work from home (i.e. at least those who can) is often one of these. The ensuing situation can be considered a natural experiment; the government's intervention effectively cancels people's commuting trip and can be considered completely exogenous. Should commuting time indeed have an adverse effect on well-being, it may be expected that those workers with long (pre-corona) commutes who have transitioned to working from home will experience an increase in their well-being. This idea is tested by combining several surveys -timed before and after the crisis- from the Longitudinal Internet Studies for the Social sciences (LISS) panel, a panel that is representative of the Dutch population. In line with expectations, the results indicate that workers with a long commuting duration who transitioned to working from home indeed increased their subjective well-being. However, this effect was found to be significant only for women and not for men. A more general finding of interest is that subjective well-being did not change much between the measurements before and during the corona-crisis."
1186,"Renewable integration for remote communities: Comparative allowable cost analyses for hydro, solar and wave energy","Robertson, Bryson; Bekker, Jessica; Buckham, Bradley","Many remote communities are reliant on diesel-fueled electricity generation. The extra-ordinary logistical and financial complications in acquiring fuel often result in energy poverty. To alleviate these realities, and simultaneously mitigate noise and emissions, communities are focused on harnessing local renewable resources to achieve aggressive decarbonization and renewable energy penetration. This study quantifies the diesel and emissions mitigation potential of micro-hydro, solar and wave energy; and defines 'allowable-cost' Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE) targets. Through the application of a bottom-up, time domain energy systems model, Remote Community Optimization Model (RCOM), differing renewable options (including wave, micro-hydro and solar) are compared. The RCOM model formulates the community's energy system operation as a cost minimization optimization problem and generates an hourly dispatch strategy. Comparing hybrid renewables-based systems to the diesel only case, the maximum allowable LCOE values for each renewable energy system to provide economic benefit to the local community are quantified. Additional sensitivities to resource availability, emissions pricing and fuel costs are explored through scenario-based sensitivity analyses. Utilizing RCOM for Hot Springs Cove (remote Canadian community), the diesel system results in LCOE of $0.76/kWh. The development of a small hydro system (225 kW) reduces the community's fuel costs by similar to$5.2 M over the 30-yr. project lifetime. However, these savings are less than the upfront construction capital, and the associated LCOE increases to $1.36/kWh. Based on the novel 'allowable-cost' analysis, wave energy was found to provide economic benefit if the supplied power could be delivered for less than $0.59/kWh; with the added benefit of reducing diesel consumption by 40%, and returning $23,206/kW installed. Comparatively, integrating solar had an allowable-cost LCOE of $0.53/kWh, reduced diesel consumption by only 12%, and gave a return of $6844/kW installed."
1187,Renewable energy consumption and economic growth in OECD countries: A nonlinear panel data analysis,"Wang, Qiang; Wang, Lili","What impact will increasing renewable energy consumption have on economic growth? What is the direction or magnitude of the impact and the determinants behind it? Existing research on the relationship between renewable energy and economic growth focuses on the linear relationship, whereas ignoring the non-linear relationship between them. In this study, the nonlinear relationship between renewable energy and economic growth in OECD countries was investigated by developing panel threshold regression models. Non-renewable energy intensity, urbanization level and per capita income are used as threshold variables to explore the internal mechanism of renewable energy for economic development. Three panel threshold models are developed based on these three threshold variables. The results show that the effect of renewable energy consumption on economic growth is positive, which indicates that increased renewable energy consumpiotn contributes to economic growth. In addition, this positive relationship changes as the threshold value changes, which means that the role of increasing renewable energy consumption to promote economic development is nonlinear. In other words, if the EU countries increase their renewable energy consumption by more than a certain amount (threshold value), the role of renewable energy consumption in promoting economic development is more significant.

1188,Explaining the political nature of environmental impact assessment (EIA): A neo-Gramscian perspective,"Bond, Alan; Pope, Jenny; Fundingsland, Monica; Morrison-Saunders, Angus; Retief, Francois; Hauptfleisch, Morgan","Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) is a mandatory decision-support tool in every country of the world, developed 50 years ago to ensure the consideration of the environmental consequences of development decisions prior to approval decisions being made. Specifically, the aim of developing an EIA system was to make decision-making affecting the environment more accountable, through the use of objective scientific evidence. It remains the project decision-support tool of choice despite considerable research efforts failing to provide convincing evidence that it achieves this aim. Here we explain this apparent paradox by arguing that EIA supports neoliberal agendas by facilitating economic development. We present arguments based on a neo-Gramscian perspective that explains how apparent advances in the practice of EIA are sanctioned because they actually maintain the political nature of the EIA system, which continues to undermine attempts to use evidence objectively. We use a narratives of change approach to support this perspective. We conclude that EIA can only make decision-making more accountable if strategies to depoliticise it are employed, including emphasising substantive outcomes. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

1189,Measuring environmental sustainability performance of South Asia,"Sun, Huaping; Mohsin, Muhammad; Alharthi, Majed; Abbas, Qaiser","Sustainability and low-carbon economy strategies have been widely studied in the past; nevertheless, researchers often ignore the effects of combining energy, economic, and environmental factors when assessing sustainability performance. To fill this gap, we measure the environmental sustainability performance of South Asia using a common weight Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA)-like mathematical model encompassing a comprehensive, up-to-date, and relevant set of indicators. In this paper, we present a measurement of South Asia's environmental sustainability performance for the years 2001-2015. Our results reveal that Bhutan outperforms the rest of the countries in South Asia, with an overall index score of 0.72. Nepal comes second in the region, with a stable score, followed by the Maldives. Afghanistan and Bangladesh are ranked fourth and fifth, respectively, and their overall scores indicate strong potential sustainability performances. India, Sri Lanka and Pakistan follow this list, with poor scores, with Pakistan having the lowest scores during the study period. Based on these findings, we propose a policy to boost the cross-border renewable energy trade for long-term environmental sustainability. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."

Besides, alcoholic fixation is advantageous over formalin fixation because of faster fixation, optimal preservation and safer workplace environment. Following fixation by EMA and 10% neutral buffered formalin (NBF), we analyzed the tissue morphology, antigenic stability, DNA and RNA quantity with quality (OD value). The findings of EMA fixing on both the tissue morphology and molecular characterization, were satisfactory. Specially, EMA was faster in penetration of tissues than NBF, fixed ideally as early as 8 h of fixation whereas improper fixation was evident for NBF. In Hematoxylin and Eosin (H & E) staining, better cellular details with stronger affinity for staining were observed. In immunohistochemistry, better antigenic stability was reported for EMA-fixed tissues. The nucleic acid analysis revealed that total genomic DNA and RNA yield from EMA fixed tissues were significantly higher (P < 0.05) with superior quality than NBF fixed tissues. Our results suggest that EMA could be a potential alternative to NBF for fixation and preservation of tissues. These data provide new insights into an option for a safer working environment to support study and research."
1191,Histomorphological and Biochemical Analysis of Rat Model of Menopausal Skin Aging,"M S Ji,X Y Yang,Y Hao,J Shi,M S Ji,X Y Yang,Y Hao,J Shi","The study examined the skin histomorphology and biochemistry in mature ovariectomized rats treated and not treated with estrogen. Biochemical parameters (superoxide dismutase, malondialdehyde, and hydroxyproline content) were measured in dorsal skin samples collected in 50 days after surgery. The morphology of dorsal skin was analyzed under a microscope. In ovariectomized rats, the skin levels of superoxide dismutase and hydroxyproline were significantly lower, while the superoxide dismutase content was significantly higher than in shamoperated animals (p<0.05). Estrogen therapy significantly increased the levels of superoxide dismutase and hydroxyproline and reduced superoxide dismutase level in ovariectomized rats in comparison with the corresponding parameters in untreated ovariectomized animals (p<0.05). Histomorphological analysis of the skin from non-treated ovariectomized rats revealed reduced vascularization and lower density of papillary capillaries in comparison with these parameters in sham-operated controls; estrogen treatment prevented these changes. We concluded that ovariectomized rats can be employed as a model of aging skin in menopause."

Most of the countries impose a lockdown system with social distancing measures to arrest the rapid transmission of this virus into the human body. The objective of this study is to examine the status of air quality during and pre-COVID-19 lockdown and to recommend some long-term sustainable environmental management plan. The pollution data like PM10, PM2.5, O-3, SO2, NO(2)and CO have been obtained from State Pollution Control Board under Govt. of West Bengal. Similarly, various land surface temperature (LST) maps have been prepared using LANDSAT-8 OLI and LANDSAT-7 ETM + images of USGS. The maps of NO(2)and aerosol concentration over Indian subcontinent have been taken from ESA and NASA. The digital thematic maps and diagrams have been depicted by Grapher 13 and Arc GIS 10.3 platforms. The result shows that the pollutants like CO, NO(2)and SO(2)are significantly decreased, while the average level of O(3)has been slightly increased in 2020 during the lockdown due to close-down of all industrial and transport activities. Meanwhile, around 17.5% was the mean reduction of PM(10)and PM(2.5)during lockdown compared with previous years owing to complete stop of vehicles movement, burning of biomass and dust particles from the construction works. This study recommends some air pollution-tolerant plant species (in urban vacant spaces and roof tops) for long-term cohabitation among environment, society and development."
1193,Evaluation of geothermal energy extraction in Enhanced Geothermal System (EGS) with multiple fracturing horizontal wells (MFHW),"Gong, Facheng; Guo, Tiankui; Sun, Wei; Li, Zhaomin; Yang, Bin; Chen, Yimei; Qu, Zhanqing","The deep geothermal energy produced from Enhanced Geothermal System (EGS) has a great development prospect because of enormous potential and environmental friendliness. EGS process involves a complex thermal-hydraulic process, and fractures in EGS are main channels for fluid flow and heat transfer, the understanding of which is crucial to the sustainable utilization of geothermal reservoirs. In this paper, a 3D thermal-hydraulic coupled numerical model is proposed to describe the interaction of fluid flow and heat transfer. Besides, the EGS with multiple fracturing horizontal wells (MFHW) is adopted to evaluate the effect of multiple hydraulic fractures on geothermal energy extraction performance. The MFHW with multiple stimulated fractures could increase fluid flow path and heat exchange area significantly, thereby enhance the heat recovery ability. Firstly, we analyzed the evolution of temperature and flow fields in EGS and compared the MFHW EGS with conventional vertical EGS. Secondly, the effects of fracturing parameters, including the fracture number, fracture length, and fracture conductivity, on heat extraction performance were investigated. Finally, the cost for drilling and hydraulic fracturing in MFHW EGS was calculated. The results indicate that MFHW EGS has a higher cumulative thermal production and a better heat extraction performance than that of conventional vertical EGS. For the optimization of hydraulic fracture parameters, the cumulative thermal production firstly increases and then decreases as the fracture number increases, the cumulative thermal production curve exists an inflection point of fracture number. Longer fracture length and higher fracture conductivity could enhance the cumulative thermal production, but the output growth slows down gradually. Considering economic cost, the best fracture parameters for MFHW EGS in this paper are the fracture number of 7, the fracture length of 300 m, and the fracture conductivity of 350 mu m(2).cm, respectively. The research provides a better study for multiple fracturing horizontal wells (MFHW) EGS and helps to optimize fracture parameters and geothermal reservoir management, which is conductive to improve the geothermal energy efficiency.

1194,Disaggregated renewable energy consumption and environmental pollution nexus in G-7 countries,"Destek, Mehmet Akif; Aslan, Alper","Although it is widely accepted that renewable energy consumption is vital for environmental sustainability, the environmental effectiveness of individual renewable energy types is often overlooked. Therefore, this paper examined the multivariate relationship between disaggregated renewable energy (hydroelectricity, wind, solar and biomass) consumption, economic growth and environmental pollution for the period from 1991 to 2014 in G-7 (The Group of Seven) countries. The study used both augmented mean group estimator and panel bootstrap causality method to consider the cross-sectional dependence and country specific heterogeneity across G-7 countries. Empirical findings indicate that increasing biomass energy consumption was efficient to reduce carbon emission in France, Germany, Japan and the United States; increasing hydroelectricity usage was efficient to reduce carbon emission in Italy and the United Kingdom; wind energy consumption reduced emission in Canada and solar energy usage was efficient on reducing emission in France and Italy for observed period. Moreover, in case of panel, it is found that increasing hydroelectricity, biomass and wind energy consumption reduced carbon emissions while the impact of solar energy consumption is statistically insignificant in G-7 countries. In addition, the hydroelectricity consumption was found the most efficient renewable energy source to reduce environmental pollution for the panel of G-7 countries. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

A skeletal model consisting of five joints (ear, hip, knee, ankle, and toe) and four rigid segments (head/arm/trunk or HAT, thigh, shank, and foot) connecting each joint is developed. The joint forces are calculated from the dynamic equilibrium equations, which requires the time history of joint coordinates. They are estimated from a recorded motion video using a deep neural network for pose estimation trained with human motion data. Joint coordinates can be obtained by the proposed deep neural network directly from images of jumping motion without using any markers. The validity and usefulness of the proposed method are confirmed in lab experiments. Further, our method is practically applicable to the study in a real competition environment because it is not required to attach any sensor or marker to athletes.Highlights A method to predict the ski jumping force from a recorded motion video is proposed.It combines a data-driven pose estimation with a model-based force calculation.The proposed method does not require any markers and sensors to be attached to athletes.In a laboratory environment, the relative error in the maximum jumping force is less than 7%.The method can be easily applied to a field study in a real competition environment."
1196,Risk-averse optimization of disaster relief facility location and vehicle routing under stochastic demand,"Zhong, Shaopeng; Cheng, Rong; Jiang, Yu; Wang, Zhong; Larsen, Allan; Nielsen, Otto Anker","Disasters such as fires, earthquakes, and floods cause severe casualties and enormous economic losses. One effective method to reduce these losses is to construct a disaster relief network to deliver disaster supplies as quickly as possible. This method requires solutions to the following problems. 1) Given the established distribution centers, which center(s) should be open after a disaster? 2) Given a set of vehicles, how should these vehicles be assigned to each open distribution center? 3) How can the vehicles be routed from the open distribution center(s) to demand points as efficiently as possible? 4) How many supplies can be delivered to each demand point on the condition that the relief allocation plan is made a priority before the actual demands are realized? This study proposes a model for risk-averse optimization of disaster relief facility location and vehicle routing under stochastic demand that solves the four problems simultaneously. The novel contribution of this study is its presentation of a new model that includes conditional value at risk with regret (CVaR-R)-defined as the expected regret of worst-case scenarios-as a risk measure that considers both the reliability and unreliability aspects of demand variability in the disaster relief facility location and vehicle routing problem. Two objectives are proposed: the CVaR-R of the waiting time and the CVaR-R of the system cost. Due to the nonlinear capacity constraints for vehicles and distribution centers, the proposed problem is formulated as a bi-objective mixed-integer nonlinear programming model and is solved with a hybrid genetic algorithm that integrates a genetic algorithm to determine the satisfactory solution for each demand scenario and a non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II) to obtain the non-dominated Pareto solution that considers all demand scenarios. Moreover, the Nash bargaining solution is introduced to capture the decision-maker's interests of the two objectives. Numerical examples demonstrate the trade-off between the waiting time and system cost and the effects of various parameters, including the confidence level and distance parameter, on the solution. It is found that the Pareto solutions are distributed unevenly on the Pareto frontier due to the difference in the number of the distribution centers opened. The Pareto frontier and Nash bargaining solution change along with the confidence level and distance parameter, respectively."
1197,Renewable energy for sustainable rural development: Synergies and mismatches,"Clausen, Laura Tolnov; Rudolph, David","Energy transition is increasingly regarded as a promising opportunity for the economic development of rural areas. This possibility is associated with the siting and (co-)ownership of decentralized (small-scale) renewable energy facilities. The underlying productive link, however, has been taken for granted, rather than conceptually and practically cultivated. Thus, while renewable energy-based rural development has been stated as a desired by-product of energy transitions, its potential has remained largely unfulfilled. This review aims to illuminate the ambiguous interplay between renewable energy and rural development in the context of the current trajectories of the energy transition. In doing so, we first examine different ways renewable energy may contribute to rural development and explore how the synergetic conflation of renewable energy and rural development has played out in Denmark and Scotland, as two countries that have forged ahead with renewable energy in rural areas. Second, we draw on the different experiences in the two countries to critically discuss policy-related mismatches that hamper a more efficient contribution of renewable energy to rural development, and sketch out some thoughts about the need to bring rural matters and rural communities into the discussion if the synergies between energy transition and rural development are to be taken seriously."

The purpose of this study is to accurately measure CO2 emissions at the city scale in China and examine the environmental Kuznets curve, thereby providing a reference for decision-making. Corrected NPP-VIIRS nighttime light data were used to accurately estimate carbon dioxide emissions at the provincial and city scales in China. Then, based on the STRIPAT model, 291 cities in China were used to verify the environmental Kuznets curve. Our results show that on the provincial scale, the R-2 between the estimated value and the statistical value of carbon dioxide reaches 0.85. Western cities in China emit more CO2, as do economically developed cities and industry- and mining-dominated cities. There are two CO2 emission hot spots in the north and one cold spot in the south. It was found that the environmental Kuznets curve on the city scale exists. This study has practical value in utilizing NPP-VIIRS data for the estimation of city CO2 emissions. The results also have academic value for determining factors that contribute to carbon dioxide emissions and can provide a reference for relevant decision makers. This study could be considered the first to simulate CO2 emissions at the provincial and city levels in China based on a NPP-VIIRS nighttime light model to explore the associated geographical distribution characteristics and potential influencing factors.

Since the discovery that brown adipose tissue (BAT) exists in adult humans, and BAT activation contributes to a negative energy balance, much more attention has been focused on the understanding of the molecular switches and their different regulatory mechanisms turning on energy expenditure. Recent insights have revealed that a range of stimuli including cold exposure, physical activity and diet, and critical transcription molecules such as PPARγ, PRDM16, PGC-1α and UCP1, aiming at the induction of BAT activation, could cause the browning of white adipose tissue, thereby dissipating energy and increasing heat production. An increasing number of studies that point to the white adipose tissue (WAT) browning strategies aiming at diet-induced and/or genetically determined obesity have been tested in mouse models as well as in human studies. The aim of this review is to summarize the transcriptional regulators as well as the various mediators that have been regarded as potential therapeutic targets in the process of WAT browning."

In the absence of quantitative models, methods based on expert knowledge are the best option for assessing future invasion trajectories. Here, we present an expert assessment of the drivers of potential alien species impacts under contrasting scenarios and socioecological contexts through the mid-21st century. Based on responses from 36 experts in biological invasions, moderate (20%-30%) increases in invasions, compared to the current conditions, are expected to cause major impacts on biodiversity in most socioecological contexts. Three main drivers of biological invasions-transport, climate change and socio-economic change-were predicted to significantly affect future impacts of alien species on biodiversity even under a best-case scenario. Other drivers (e.g. human demography and migration in tropical and subtropical regions) were also of high importance in specific global contexts (e.g. for individual taxonomic groups or biomes). We show that some best-case scenarios can substantially reduce potential future impacts of biological invasions. However, rapid and comprehensive actions are necessary to use this potential and achieve the goals of the Post-2020 Framework of the Convention on Biological Diversity."

According to the results of panel quantile regression model for 17 countries, the tourism-led growth hypothesis is valid in low growth levels, but deviations from this hypothesis are determined after the middle growth level. Also, the CO(2)coefficient at low growth levels indicated that sustainable growth is achieved, but no significant results are obtained at subsequent growth levels. Finally, energy consumption supports economic growth at low and medium growth levels. Short-run causality test results illustrated that there is bidirectional causality between GDP and all explanatory variables."
1202,"Water quality index, Labeo rohita, and Eichhornia crassipes: Suitable bio-indicators of river water pollution","Shams Tabrez,Torki A Zughaibi,Mehjbeen Javed,Shams Tabrez,Torki A Zughaibi,Mehjbeen Javed","The present study investigated the water quality index (WQI) of the Kshipra river at Dewas, Madhya Pradesh, India, using native fish Labeo rohita, and plant Eichhornia crassipes. The temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen, alkalinity, turbidity, and dissolved solids were found to be within the prescribed limits. However, heavy metals concentration exceeded the limit except for Cu and Zn. Their occurrence in river water was as follows: Ni > Fe > Cd > Cr > Mn > Zn > Cu. Among these heavy metals, Cd was found to be highly bioavailable, whereas Zn was the least bioavailable metal. Based on WQI, the water was found to be unfit for drinking, and the high WQI value was due to the presence of Cr and Cd. In fish tissues (muscle, liver, gut, gills, and kidney), the highest and lowest metal pollution index was found in gills (45.03) and kidneys (12.21), respectively. Bioaccumulation of these metals resulted in significant depletion of energy reserves (protein, glucose, and glycogen) and also altered hematological parameters. Moreover, liver function tests showed hepatic damage in the exposed fish. In-plant, both the bioaccumulation and mobility factor exceeded 1 for all these metals. On the other hand, the translocation factor was found to be beyond 1 for Fe, Ni, and Zn. These high values make this plant fit for phytoextraction of Mn, Fe, Cu, Zn, and Cd and phytostabilization of Cr in water. Moreover, consumption of L. rohita from the Kshipra River does not pose a non-cancer risk as the target hazard quotient was below 1, but it may pose cancer risk because of the presence of Cr in the range of 1.402 × 10-3 to 1.599 × 10-3."
1203,Sustainable design and optimization of coal supply chain network under different carbon emission policies,"Li, Jinying; Wang, Lin; Tan, Xin","In recent years, coal power has obvious advantages in terms of safety, economy and stability. As people gradually realize the importance of the environment, low carbon has become one of the core indicators of power system evaluation, so it is particularly important to guide the coal enterprises to achieve a win-win situation of economic and environmental benefits. Combined with the carbon emission policies, this paper takes the coal supply chain network as the research object and aims to develop a comprehensive decision model for sustainable design of coal supply chain. First, this paper extracts the influencing factors of low-carbonization in coal supply chain and constructs an interpretative structural model (ISM). The results show that low-carbon green technology, low-carbon production cost, utilization level of green energy and energy efficiency are the most basic manifestations of low-carbonization of coal supply chain and interact with each other, therefore this paper builds an optimization model with the objective of minimizing the low-carbon production costs in the coal supply chain. Concurrently, this paper introduces four policies (emission cap, carbon tax, carbon trade and carbon offset) as constraint condition. Then, in the aspect of model solving, this paper combines the differential evolution (DE) strategy to mutate, cross and select the leaders generated in each iteration of the salp swarm algorithm (SSA), further increases the diversity of the salp swarm, avoids the algorithm falling into a local optimum, and proposes the salp swarm algorithm based on differential evolution (DE-SSA). Finally, this paper compares the effects of four different carbon emission policies on the optimization of coal supply chain network through empirical analysis, and finds that coal enterprises have the best emission reduction effect under the carbon trade policy. The development and implementation of this paper not only enriches the related research of efficient supply chain, but also provides scientific and quantifiable decision-making technology for coal enterprises.

1204,Impact of using information and communication technology and renewable energy on health expenditure: A case study from Pakistan,"Shahzad, Khuram; Zeng Jianqiu; Hashim, Muhammad; Nazam, Muhammad; Wang, Lei","The objective of this study is to explore the dynamic linkages between health expenditure, economic growth, CO2 emission, information and communication technology and renewable energy consumption in the case of Pakistan. To fulfill the study objective, a variety of econometric methods is employed over the period of 1995-2017. The results indicated the dynamic linkages among under-considered variables. The results established that economic growth and CO2 emission have a positive Impact on health expenditure, while information and communication technology and renewable energy consumption have a negative impact on health expenditure. Moreover, bidirectional Granger causality is confirmed between Health expenditure, economic growth, carbon dioxide emission, and information and communication technology. The unidirectional causality is running from renewable energy consumption to these variables. Short-run causality is running from renewable energy consumption to health expenditure and economic growth. Furthermore, short-run causality is running from information and communication technology to economic growth. Consequently, this study empirically contributed by confirming the critical role of information and communication technology and renewable energy consumption in reducing health expenditure. So, the policymakers should invest in information and communication technology and renewable energy projects to enhance air quality and provide a healthy environment to society.

1205,Wilson's Disease Update: An Indian Perspective,"Niraj Kumar,L K Prashant,Vinay Goyal,Niraj Kumar,L K Prashant,Vinay Goyal","Wilson's disease (WD) is an autosomal recessive disorder due to ATP7B gene mutation, resulting in defective copper metabolism, with the liver and brain being primarily affected. WD being a treatable disorder, early diagnosis and proper management may result in near complete recovery. It has received significant attention over the past 50 years, with several Indian contributions. This study collates published Indian studies on WD in Pubmed and Embase databases and puts them in perspective. Several Indian case series suggest WD may be more prevalent than thought. Commonly detected ATP7B mutation in India is p.C271X. Although initial Indian series reported significant osseomuscular presentation, neuropsychiatric and hepatic manifestations dominated the later reports. A significant male predominance is observed in the Indian series. Pure hepatic presentation starts earlier than neurological or osseomuscular WD. A positive family history may be seen in nearly 50% of Indian WD cases, with a high rate of consanguinity. Up to two-third of the Indian cases may be initially misdiagnosed, with a mean diagnostic delay of up to 2 years. Abnormalities in serum ceruloplasmin and 24-hour urinary copper has been reported in more than four-fifth cases. Brain MRI is abnormal in nearly all neurological WD cases. Copper chelation remains the mainstay of therapy, with D-penicillamine being the most widely used chelator in India. Global Assessment Scale for WD is a comprehensive tool for clinical monitoring. Hepatic presentation carries a five-time higher mortality risk than neurological, with up to 90% Indian neurological WD cases recovering back to pre-morbid functionality with adequate therapy."

Radiology plays a crucial role in the diagnosis and management of pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB). This review aims to improve understanding and diagnostic value of imaging in PTB. We present the old, well-established findings ranging from primary TB to the common appearances of post-primary TB, including dissemination with tree-in-bud nodularity, haematogenous dissemination with miliary nodules and lymphatic dissemination. We discuss new concepts in active PTB with special focus on imaging findings in immunocompromised individuals. We illustrate PTB appearances borrowed from other diseases in which the signs were initially described: the reversed halo sign, the galaxy sign and the cluster sign. There are several radiological signs that have been shown to correlate with positive or negative sputum smears, and radiologists should be aware of these signs as they play an important role in guiding the need for isolation and empirical anti-tuberculous therapy."
1207,Is income inequality a driver for renewable energy consumption?,"Uzar, Umut","Although many initiatives have been made to research the effect of income inequality on environmental issues, the question of whether income inequality affects renewable energy consumption hasn't been answered. This gap in the literature raises an important question that needs to be answered by researchers: can the income inequality affect renewable energy consumption? As far as is known, the study is the first attempt to discover this relationship. Therefore, the impact of income inequality on renewable energy consumption is examined theoretically and empirically in 43 developed and developing countries for 2000-2015. In order to avoid the omitted variable problem; economic, environmental and institutional variables such as GDP per capita, corruption, CO2 emissions and trade openness are included in the model. The results demonstrate that the decline in income inequality will enhance renewable energy consumption. In other words, policymakers have the opportunity to reduce income inequality and environmental degradation at the same time. Similarly, corruption control and raise CO2 emissions will increase also renewable energy consumption. Otherwise, economic determinants such as economic growth and trade openness have no meaningful effect on renewable energy consumption. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."

There is growing interest in the potential of psychedelic substances (e.g., psilocybin) in conjunction with psychotherapy to treat chronic pain. Via a cross-sectional, anonymous, online survey, we aimed to characterize knowledge, perceptions, and past use of serotonergic (""classic"") and non-serotonergic psychedelics among a population of individuals with FM, and to investigate interest in psychedelic-based FM treatments. Among a North American population of 354 participants with FM, 29.9% reported past use of a psychedelic, with lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) and psilocybin mushrooms being most commonly used. Perceptions of benefit from psychedelic use were generally neutral (59.4%) or positive (36.8%), with <3% reporting negative impacts on overall health or pain symptoms. Among 12 participants who used psychedelics with intentions of treating chronic pain, 11 reported improved symptoms. Regardless of past use, the majority of participants believed that psychedelics have potential for chronic pain treatments and would be willing to participate in a psychedelic-based clinical trial for their pain. These findings support the need for additional studies to understand the potential and effectiveness of psychedelic substances in managing FM symptoms."
1209,Sustainable consumption in the circular economy. An analysis of consumers' purchase intentions for waste-to-value food,"Coderoni, Silvia; Perito, Maria Angela","This study is aimed at evaluating the relative influence of socio-demographic and psychological features that rule the extent to which consumers engage in the circular economy, purchasing waste-to-value (WTV) food enriched with ingredients otherwise wasted in the supply chain. 477 Italian consumers replied to a web-based questionnaire administered through different social media networks. Two different consumers' purchase intentions were analysed: consumers were asked both if they would be willing to buy WTV food and if they would buy WTV food if this would help to reduce the environmental impact of agricultural production. Binary logistic regressions are estimated to appraise the eventual drivers of consumers' statements. Among these drivers, attention was given to aspects related to the generalised aversion to new foods, i.e. food neophobia (FN) and the aversion to food processed in new ways, i.e. food technology neophobia (FTN). Other relevant economic and demographic factors were investigated, together with aspects related to generalised trust, purchase behaviours and preferences. The main results indicate that 56% of respondents declared to be willing to buy WTV food, however, FN and FTN negatively influence the probability of stating a positive purchase intention. Consumers who give importance to reading food labels and think that food could have environmental or health benefits, are more likely to be willing to buy WTV food. In addition, a core of sustainable consumers seems to emerge who express a positive purchase intention for WTV food to reduce the environmental impact of production and give importance to the origin and nutritional values of products. In conclusion, policy implications are drawn. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."
1210,The contributions of socioeconomic indicators to global PM2.5 based on the hybrid method of spatial econometric model and geographical and temporal weighted regression,"Fu, Zhaoyang; Li, Rui","PM2.5 pollution poses a negative effect on human health and economic growth. However, the major socioeconomic driving forces of global PM2.5 pollution during a long-term period remained unclear. In this study, we explored the potential association between socioeconomic indicators and the PM2.5 level worldwide using a spatial econometric model coupled with a geographical and temporal weighted regression (GTWR). The results suggested that renewable energy consumption ratio, per capita gross domestic production (GDP), per capita CO2 emission, urban population ratio, and fossil fuel consumption ratio were major factors responsible for the global PM2.5 pollution. The impacts of socioeconomic indicators on the PM2.5 level varied with the income-level and time. Fossil fuel consumption ratio, per capita CO2 emission, urban population ratio were major contributors for severe PM2.5 pollution in the developing countries (e.g., China and India). Further, these impacts have become more remarkable in recent years. Per capita GDP still played a crucial role on the PM2.5 pollution in India, indicating that energy-intensive industries were major contributors to its economic growth, thereby leading to the higher PM2.5 concentration in India. However, China has strode across the inflection of Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) as a whole and decreased the reliance on the secondary industries. Compared with the developing countries, the impacts of socioeconomic indicators on PM2.5 pollution in most of the developed countries remained relatively stable and weak, implicating that fossil fuel consumption and urbanization were not major contributors for local PM, level. The findings of this study clarified major contributors for PM2.5 pollution, and provided scientific basis for mitigating the PM2.5 pollution. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."
1211,Implications of nocebo in anaesthesia care,"K Arrow,L L Burgoyne,A M Cyna,K Arrow,L L Burgoyne,A M Cyna","Nocebo refers to non-pharmacological adverse effects of an intervention. Well-intended procedural warnings frequently function as a nocebo. Both nocebo and placebo are integral to the generation of 'real' treatment effects and their associated 'real' side-effects. They are induced or exacerbated by: context; negative expectancy; and negative conditioning surrounding treatment. Since the late 1990s, the neuroscience literature has repeatedly demonstrated that the nocebo effect is mediated by discrete neurobiological mechanisms and specific physiological modulations. Although no single biological mechanism has been found to explain the nocebo effect, nocebo hyperalgesia is thought to initiate from the dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex subsequently triggering the brain's descending pain modulatory system and other pain regulation pathways. Functional magnetic resonance imaging shows that expectation of increased pain is accompanied by increased neural activity in the hippocampus and midcingulate cortex which is not observed when analgesia is expected. Functional magnetic resonance imaging studies have shown that the anterior cingulate cortex is pivotal in the perception of affective pain evoked by nocebo words. Research has also explored neurotransmitters which mediate the nocebo effect. The neuropeptide cholecystokinin appears to play a key role in the modulation of pain by nocebo. Hyperalgesia generated by nocebo also increases the activity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis as indicated by increases in plasma cortisol. The avoidance or mitigation of nocebo needs to be recognised as a core clinical skill in optimising anaesthesia care. Embracing the evidence around nocebo will allow for phrases such as 'bee sting' and 'sharp scratch' to be thought of as clumsy verbal relics of the past. Anaesthesia as a profession has always prided itself on practicing evidence-based medicine, yet for decades anaesthetists and other healthcare staff have communicated in ways counter to the evidence. The premise of every interaction should be 'primum non nocere' (first, do no harm). Whether the context is research or clinical anaesthesia practice, the nocebo can be ignored no longer."
1212,Codoped Holey Graphene Aerogel by Selective Etching for High-Performance Sodium-Ion Storage,"Zhao, Jin; Zhang, Yi-Zhou; Chen, Jianyu; Zhang, Wenli; Yuan, Du; Chua, Rodney; Alshareef, Husam N.; Ma, Yanwen","The pursuit of more efficient carbon-based anodes for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) prepared from facile and economical methods is a very important endeavor. Based on the crystallinity difference within carbon materials, herein, a low-temperature selective burning method is developed for preparing oxygen and nitrogen codoped holey graphene aerogel as additive-free anode for SIBs. By selective burning of a mixture of graphene and low-crystallinity carbon at 450 degrees C in air, an elastic porous graphene monolith with abundant holes on graphene sheets and optimized crystallinity is obtained. These structural characteristics lead to an additive-free electrode with fast charge (ions and electrons) transfer and more abundant Na+ storage active sites. Moreover, the heteroatom oxygen/nitrogen doping favors large interlayer distance for rapid Na+ insertion/extraction and provides more active sites for high capacitive contribution. The optimized sample exhibits superior sodium-ion storage capability, i.e., high specific capacity (446 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 A g(-1)), ultrahigh rate capability (189 mAh g(-1) at 10 A g(-1)), and long cycle life (81.0% capacity retention after 2000 cycles at 5 A g(-1)). This facile and economic strategy might be extended to fabricating other superior carbon-based energy storage materials."
1213,"How (Un)sustainable Environments Are Related to the Diffusion of COVID-19: The Relation between Coronavirus Disease 2019, Air Pollution, Wind Resource and Energy","Coccia, Mario","The pandemic caused by novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is generating a high number of cases and deaths, with negative effects on public health and economic systems. One of the current questions in the contemporary environmental and sustainability debate is how high air pollution and reduced use of renewable energy can affect the diffusion of COVID-19. This study endeavors to explain the relation between days of air pollution, wind resources and energy, and the diffusion of COVID-19 to provide insights into sustainable policy to prevent future epidemics. The statistical analysis here focuses on a case study of Italy, one of the first countries to experience a rapid increase in confirmed cases and deaths. The results reveal two main findings: (1) cities with high wind speed and high wind energy production have a lower number of cases of COVID-19 in the context of a more sustainable environment; (2) cities located in hinterland zones with high air pollution, low wind speed and less wind energy production have a greater number of cases and total deaths. The results presented here suggest that the pandemic caused by novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) and future epidemics similar to COVID-19 cannot be solved only with research in medicine but the solution also needs advanced capabilities and technologies for supporting sustainable development based on the reduction of air pollution and increase of production in renewable energy to improve air quality and as a consequence public health."
1214,Letter Features as Predictors of Letter-Name Acquisition in Four Languages with Three Scripts,"Young-Suk Grace Kim,Yaacov Petscher,Rebecca Treiman,Benjamin Kelcey,Young-Suk Grace Kim,Yaacov Petscher,Rebecca Treiman,Benjamin Kelcey","To expand our understanding of script-general and script-specific principles in the learning of letter names, we examined how three characteristics of alphabet letters-their frequency in printed materials, order in the alphabet, and visual similarity to other letters-relate to children's letter-name knowledge in four languages with three distinct scripts (English [N = 318; M age = 4.90], Portuguese [N = 366; M age = 5.80], Korean [N = 168; M age = 5.48], and Hebrew [N = 645; M age = 5.42]). Explanatory item response modeling analysis showed that the frequency of letters in printed materials was consistently related to letter difficulty across the four languages. There were also moderation effects for letter difficulty in English and Korean, and for discriminatory power of letters in Korean. The results suggest that exposure to letters as measured by letter frequency is a language-general mechanism in the learning of alphabet letters."
1215,The heterogeneous effect of driving factors on carbon emission intensity in the Chinese transport sector: Evidence from dynamic panel quantile regression,"Huang, Yuan; Zhu, Huiming; Zhang, Zhongqingyang","The transport sector is becoming a key sector for China to accomplish its targets for reducing carbon emission intensity (CEI). Identifying the dominant factors driving CEI of the transport sector is important for CEI mitigation. This paper applied dynamic panel quantile regression to explore the effect of driving factors on CEI in the Chinese transport sector at the provincial level during 2000-2016. The empirical findings indicate that economic growth has a positive influence on CEI at low quantiles, whereas this effect is the opposite at high quantiles. Further, the findings show an inverted U-shaped pattern between economic growth and CEI at lowquantiles, which validates the Environmental Kuznets Curve hypothesis in low-CEI provinces. Energy intensity positively influences CEI, with the greatest impact occurring at higher quantiles. Among the lowest CEI provinces, private vehicles and cargo turnover appear to contribute to CEI, and a positive impact of urbanization exists, except at the 5th and 30th quantiles. In conclusion, policy implications for effectively promoting the CEI abatement in the transport sector are discussed. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

However, only a few biologically active substances have been identified from it. In this study, the epidermis, xylem and pith of Gleditsiae Spina, respectively Gs-E, Gs-X and Gs-P, were studied. We used a widely targeted metabolomics method to investigate the chemical composition of Gs-E, Gs-X and Gs-P. A total of 728 putative metabolites were identified from Gleditsiae Spina, including 211 primary metabolites and 517 secondary metabolites. These primary and secondary metabolites could be categorized into more than 10 different classes. Flavonoids, phenolic acids, lipids, amino acids and derivatives, and organic acids constituted the main metabolite groups. Multivariate statistical analysis showed that the Gs-E, Gs-X and Gs-P samples could be clearly separated. Differential accumulated metabolite (DAM) analysis revealed that more than half of the DAMs exhibited the highest relative concentrations in Gs-E, and most of the DAMs showed the lowest relative concentrations in Gs-X. Moreover, 11 common differential primary metabolites and 79 common differential secondary metabolites were detected in all comparison groups. These results further our understanding of chemical composition and metabolite accumulation of Gleditsiae Spina."

Alleviation of salinity effects on physiological, biochemical, and yield of wheat cultivars; Sids 14 and Misr 3 using some soil additions (control, Molasses and Humic acid), compatible solutes, and growth regulators (water as control, Naphthalene acetic acid, and Glycine betaine) were investigated in salt-affected soils. Results indicated that Misr 3 was superior to Sids 14 in all studied characteristics except flag leaf area, relative water content, plant height and recorded lower and desirable value of leaf temperature. The addition of Molasses (24 L ha-1) or Humic acid (12 L ha-1) significantly increased physiological and biochemical characteristics. At the same time, flag leaf temperature, proline, and malondialdehyde (MDA) content were decreased, yield and its attributes also increased except No. kernel spike-1. Foliar spray of Naphthalene acetic acid (NAA) at 30 mg L-1. or glycine betaine (GB 100 mM) also positively affected the studied characteristics, where Glycine betaine recorded the highest Relative water content and Fv/Fm.

1218,Analysis of regional energy economic efficiency and its influencing factors: A case study of Yangtze river urban agglomeration,"Zhong, Zhaoqiang; Peng, Benhong; Xu, Lu; Andrews, Awuah; Elahi, Ehsan","The current economic development is based on high input and high consumption, which is contrary to the current green development concept. Improving energy economic efficiency is a powerful way to balance economic development and energy consumption. This paper focuses on estimation of energy economic efficiency of Yangtze River Urban Agglomeration (YRUA). The Slack-Based Model (SBM) was used to estimate the energy economic efficiency of each city by using data from 2008 to 2017. Moreover, in order to better explore the constraints of energy economic efficiency improvement, the energy economic efficiency is decomposed into pure technical efficiency and scale efficiency. Combined with Moran index, the spatial distribution characteristics of energy efficiency in urban agglomeration are studied. The Tobit regression model was used to analysis on influencing factors of the energy economic efficiency. The results showed that the energy economic efficiency of the YRUA first declined and then increased overall. Particularly, the economic efficiency of Suzhou and Wuxi has been in the effective state of the evaluation unit, while the energy efficiency of Yangzhou, Taizhou and Zhenjiang is relatively low. From the perspective of its decomposition index, scale efficiency is the main factor restricting the efficiency of energy economy. On the one hand, the energy economic efficiency of urban agglomeration has a certain spatial aggregation, and its spatial distribution is positively correlated. On the other hand, the effect of technological progress on energy economic efficiency is not significant. The industrial structure is negatively correlated with the energy economic efficiency. Therefore, the industrial structure, economic development level and urbanization level can be promoted to improve energy economic efficiency."

One of the systems is based on the steam Rankine cycle and the next is based on recuperative organic Rankine cycle (ORC), while both of them are equipped with a LiBr-H2O absorption chiller to produce cooling. Different working fluids are considered in the ORC simulation. Energy, exergy and exergoeconomic principles are applied to compare the examined systems from thermodynamic, sustainability and economic aspects. It is observed that utilizing siloxanes as the working fluid leads to efficient performance of the ORC. Besides, employed heat recovery steam generator in the Rankine cycle and evaporator in the ORC found to be the most exergy destructive components. Results revealed that the CCHP system operating with ORC (MM as working fluid) has a better performance thermodynamically with energy utilization factor, exergy efficiency and sustainability index of 98.07, 63.6% and 2.747, respectively. This is while, Rankine-based CCHP is economically preferable with a payback period of 4.738 year compared to the system operating with ORC and a payback period of 5.074 year. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

How to accurately quantify the potential of recycling large amounts of demolition waste has been widely considered a prerequisite for effective waste management, as it contributes to numbers and scales of recycling enterprises being managed and planned in advance. However, there is limited research, if any, focusing on this niche area. This study aims to quantify the potential of recycling demolition waste amidst urban renewal by considering actual market situations and different waste types. Firstly, the whole recycling process of demolition waste was scrutinized by using the free-flow mapping technique. Models for quantifying recycling potential of non-inert and inert demolition waste were then established, respectively, based on economic value and the principle of mass conservation. Finally, a case study was conducted to verify the models by putting them into the context of Shenzhen, a young and vibrating city in China but subject to massive urban renewal pressure. Results show that the recycling process of demolition waste is mainly divided into offsite and onsite recycling, both including five stages, viz, waste generation, on-site treatment, transportation, recycling, and product regeneration. In addition, different types of demolition waste have their respective recycling potential. The recycling potential of non-inert demolition waste is RMB 19,315.85 million yuan. In contrast, the recycling potential of inert demolition waste depends on types of recyclable products, with 18.41 million tons of recyclable bricks, 7.02 million tons of mortar, 28.36 million tons of aggregate, and 4.16 million tons of lightweight wallboard. Findings of this study improve the accuracy of the existing quantification methods. The research provides useful reference for the recycling industry to adjust production scale and arrange production sites to fully harness the waste recycling potential.

1221,"Global estimation of mortality, disability-adjusted life years and welfare cost from exposure to ambient air pollution","Owusu, Phebe Asantewaa; Sarkodie, Samuel Asumadu","Environmental pollution in the era of sustained economic development is an inevitable occurrence. However, the rising levels of pollutant emissions hamper air quality, hence, affecting health outcomes. Previous studies have assessed the case-by-case effect of ambient air pollution on mortality and morbidity, however, the impact on disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) and welfare cost have not been investigated entirely. Here, we conduct an empirical analysis of the 28-Year trend to analyze the nexus between ambient particulate matter and ozone, mortality, DALYs, and welfare cost across 195 countries and territories by employing novel dynamic panel estimation methods. We find that none of the 195 countries and territories studied between 1990 and 2017 meet WHO guideline for air quality, thus, mitigating ambient air pollution is at risk. However, Spain with an annual average of PM2.5 not exceeding 15.12 mu g/m(3) is closer to WHO guideline of 10 mu g/m(3)/annum. Among the countries (China, the US, Russia, India, Germany and Japan) with the highest welfare cost of premature death associatedwith the exposure to outdoor PM2.5 and ozone, China is themost vulnerable to economic burden - spending US$1.58 trillion (constant 2010) in 2017. This study demonstrates that ambient air pollution has a significant impact on economic development (welfare cost) and health outcomes (mortality, premature deaths, and DALYs).

The proposed system is integrated of a gas turbine cycle (GTC) and a Kalina cycle (KC). A comprehensive parametric study is presented for evaluating the proposed system from energy, exergy, environmental and economic (4E) points of view. The system's governing equations are solved and validated through developing a high-accuracy computational code in Engineering Equation Solver (EES) software. The effects of some important design parameters (including compressor pressure ratio, base ammonia concentration, generator pressure and condenser pinch point temperature difference) are investigated on four appropriate criteria of energy efficiency (eta(th)), exergy efficiency (eta(ex)), levelized total emissions (LTE) and levelized total costs (LTC). Furthermore, two economic methods, payback period (PP) and net present value (NPV), are also investigated. The results show that, the simulation outputs at base design conditions are as eta(th) = 69.43%, eta(ex) = 37.90%, LTE = 87998 kg/kW, LTC = 8958 $/kW, PP = 3.34 years and NPV = 878679 $. The results of parametric analysis reveal that there is an optimal compressor pressure ratio which leads to maximum eta(th) and eta(ex) and minimum LTE and LTC. The combustion chamber of GTC has the maximum share in system's total exergy destruction (with 55.95% of total exergy destruction). Also, the entire KC has a low contribution of 3.396% in total exergy destruction."
1223,"Environmental pollution, economic growth, population, industrialization, and technology in weak and strong sustainability: using STIRPAT model","Nasrollahi, Zahra; Hashemi, Mohadeseh-sadat; Bameri, Saeed; Mohamad Taghvaee, Vahid","The recent decades have witnessed an alarmingly phenomenal rise in population and economic growth, increasing the global resource demand and environmental degradation. The main objective of this study is to investigate the relationships between population, industrialization, affluence, technology, and sustainability. Approaching sustainability, a couple of viewpoints including weak and strong sustainability establish two different priorities, albeit with possibly the same factors as in the IPAT and STIRPAT models. This paper employs STIRPAT equation to estimate the relationships between population, industrialization, affluence, technology, and sustainability in MENA and OECD countries during 1975-2015. The results suggest that weak and strong sustainability, albeit slightly, is affected negatively by population and industrialization, and positively by technology and international agreements on environment, in MENA and OECD countries during 1975-2015. Therefore, the policy-makers in sustainability are advised to develop preventive and qualitative strategies for population and industrial activities, but inflationary ones for technology; besides the governments are suggested to confirm, join, and sign the international treaties on environmental conservation."

The results revealed that the AVT-AM formulation has good flow properties and aerosol deposition with a particle size of 3418 nm ± 26.86. The formulation was also assessed in vitro for cytotoxicity effects (proliferation, apoptosis, and cell cycle progression) on A549 human lung adenocarcinoma. Compared with free AVT, the AVT-AM formulation has significantly higher cellular uptake and anti-cancer properties by disrupting cell cycle progression via either apoptosis or cell cycle arrest in the G2/M phase. This study shows that AVT loaded mannitol microcarriers may provide a potentially effective and sustained pulmonary drug delivery for lung cancer treatment."
1225,Robotic versus laparoscopic low anterior resection following neoadjuvant chemoradiation therapy for stage II-III locally advanced rectal cancer: a single-centre cohort study,"Fiorenzo V Angehrn,Romano Schneider,Alexander Wilhelm,Diana Daume,Luca Koechlin,Lana Fourie,Markus von Flüe,Beatrice Kern,Daniel C Steinemann,Martin Bolli,Fiorenzo V Angehrn,Romano Schneider,Alexander Wilhelm,Diana Daume,Luca Koechlin,Lana Fourie,Markus von Flüe,Beatrice Kern,Daniel C Steinemann,Martin Bolli","Neoadjuvant chemo-radiotherapy (nCRT) of locally advanced rectal cancer is associated with challenging surgical treatment and increased postoperative morbidity. Robotic technology overcomes laparoscopy limitations by enlarged 3D view, improved anatomical transection accuracy, and physiologic tremor reduction. Patients with UICC stage II-III rectal cancer, consecutively referred to our institution between March 2015 and June 2020 (n = 102) were treated with robotic (Rob-G, n = 38) or laparoscopic (Lap-G, n = 64) low anterior resection (LAR) for total meso-rectal excision (TME) following highly standardized and successful nCRT treatment. Feasibility, conversion rates, stoma creation, morbidity and clinical/pathological outcome were comparatively analysed. Sex, age, BMI, ASA scores, cTN stages and tumour distance from dentate line were comparable in the two groups. Robotic resection was always feasible without conversion to open surgery, which was necessary in 11/64 (17%) Lap-G operations (p = 0.006). Primary or secondary stomata were created in 17/38 (45%) Rob-G and 52/64 (81%) Lap-G patients (p < 0.001). Major morbidity occurred in 7/38 (18.4%) Rob-G and 6/64 (9.3%) Lap-G patients (p = 0.225). Although median operation time was longer in Rob-G compared with Lap-G (376; IQR: 330-417 min vs. 300; IQR: 270-358 min; p < 0.001), the difference was not significant in patients (Rob-G, n = 6; Lap-G, n = 10) with ≥30 BMI (p = 0.106). Number of resected lymph nodes, ypTN staging and circumferential resection margins (CRM) were comparable. Resection was complete in 87% of Rob-G and 89% of Lap-G patients (p = 0.750). Robotic LAR is not inferior to laparoscopic LAR following nCRT. Larger, randomized studies are needed to confirm lower conversion in robotic, compared to laparoscopic resection."
1226,Development and application of novel BiFC probes for cell sorting based on epigenetic modification,"Agnes Mendonca,Oscar Sánchez,Han Zhao,Li Lin,Alan Min,Chongli Yuan,Agnes Mendonca,Oscar Sánchez,Han Zhao,Li Lin,Alan Min,Chongli Yuan","The epigenetic signature of cancer cells varies with disease progression and drug treatment, necessitating the study of these modifications with single cell resolution over time. The rapid detection and sorting of cells based on their underlying epigenetic modifications by flow cytometry can enable single cell measurement and tracking to understand tumor heterogeneity and progression warranting the development of a live-cell compatible epigenome probes. In this work, we developed epigenetic probes based on bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) and demonstrated their capabilities in quantifying and sorting cells based on their epigenetic modification contents. The sorted cells are viable and exhibit distinctive responses to chemo-therapy drugs. Notably, subpopulations of MCF7 cells with higher H3K9me3 levels are more likely to develop resistance to Doxorubicin. Subpopulations with higher 5mC levels, on the other hand, tend to be more responsive. Overall, we report for the first time, the application of novel split probes in flow cytometry application and elucidated the potential role of 5mC and H3K9me3 in determining drug responses."
1227,A novel cooperative game network DEA model for marine circular economy performance evaluation of China,"Ding, Li-li; Lei, Liang; Wang, Lei; Zhang, Liang-fu; Calin, Adrian Cantemir","This paper proposes a novel cooperative game network DEA model for evaluating marine circular economy (MCE) performance. The proposed model considers the bidirectional link between the economic production (EP) and environmental treatment (ET) subsystems within the MCE system. Then, the cooperative game strategy between subsystems is modeled by maximizing the factor inefficiency both of subsystems into the model's measurement from a centralized control perspective. The evaluation results of China's regional MCE performances over 2006-2015 show that while most coastal areas have a better efficiency score for the EP system, their performance of the ET system is worse and leads to poor MCE performances. In addition, converge analysis indicates that there exists beta converge of efficiency difference across coastal regions in the long term. Furthermore, the efficiency decomposition reveals that many inefficient environmental treatment inputs contribute to the worse performance of the ET system. Based on the above findings, several specific policy implications for the existing problems are provided to promote China's MCE. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."

But in recent years, some intriguing functionalities are discovered by defect engineering. In this work, we demonstrate a bifunctional memory device of a MoS2/BiFeO3/SrTiO3 van der Waals heterostructure, which can be programmed and erased by solely one kind of external stimuli (light or electrical-gate pulse) via engineering of oxygen-vacancy-based solid-ionic gating. The device shows multibit electrical memory capability (>22 bits) with a large linearly tunable dynamic range of 7.1 × 106 (137 dB). Furthermore, the device can be programmed by green- and red-light illuminations and then erased by UV light pulses. Besides, the photoresponse under red-light illumination reaches a high photoresponsivity (6.7 × 104 A/W) and photodetectivity (2.12 × 1013 Jones). These results highlighted solid-ionic memory for building up multifunctional electronic and optoelectronic devices."
1229,Thermo-economic modeling and analysis of an NG-fueled SOFC-WGS-TSA-PEMFC hybrid energy conversion system for stationary electricity power generation,"Wu, Zhen; Zhu, Pengfei; Yao, Jing; Tan, Peng; Xu, Haoran; Chen, Bin; Yang, Fusheng; Zhang, Zaoxiao; Ni, Meng","The natural gas fueled system coupling solid oxide fuel cell, water gas shift reaction, thermal swing adsorption and proton exchange membrane fuel cell (SOFC-WGS-TSA-PEMFC) could have a high efficiency and fast response for power generation. The thermo-economic analyses show that the hybrid system could have a better economy for electricity generation, whose specific electricity cost with LaNi5 as the thermal swing adsorption (TSA) working medium is 4.058 cent/kW h only, remarkably lower than that of a standard power plant (5.46 cent/kW h). The sensitivity analysis indicates the low sensitivity of the system to the market price fluctuation. When using the Mg+2 wt%Ni or TiFe metal hydride with the higher hydrogen capacity and the cheaper price as the TSA working medium for H-2 production, the specific electricity energy cost can be further reduced to 3.958 cent/kW h, which could be more economical than that with the traditional pressure swing adsorption or the membrane reactor for H-2 production. In addition, the large-scale electricity power generation helps to cut down the system specific cost. These results reveal that the hybrid system could be a promising and economical energy conversion system for stationary electricity power generation. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."

In this process, China's population and industries continue to inundate its cities, and environmental pollution has become a critical problem. This study uses panel data spanning 1998 to 2015 from 29 Chinese provinces and a comprehensive framework of well-designed generalized method of moments (GMM) models to accurately examine the relationships between urbanization and per capita sulfur dioxide (PSO2), per capita industrial soot (PSOOT), and per capita industrial waste gas (PIWG). A newly developed dynamic threshold panel model that incorporates GMM characteristics is utilized to explore how urbanization affects environmental pollution under different industrial structures. This study finds evidence of a comprehensive relationship among urbanization development, the industrial structure, and environmental pollution. Urbanization has contributed to increased environmental pollution. A nonlinear relationship exists between urbanization and environmental pollution in China. Further, urbanization increasingly promotes environmental pollution with an increase in the proportion of secondary industries; however, such promotion decreases with an increase in the proportion of tertiary industries.

In these patients, obesity leads to increasing comorbidities as well as reduced quality of life. Obesity causes an inflammatory state in the body, especially in adolescents; obesity has a role in the pathogenesis of MS. Hence, it is identified as a lifestyle modifiable risk factor for MS disease. Among various treatments for obesity, bariatric surgery has been widely used. Although few studies have been performed on bariatric surgery in MS patients, in this review, we present the existing data regarding the effects of obesity on the MS course and evaluate the outcomes of bariatric surgery among this population."
1232,Pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide receptor activation in the hypothalamus recruits unique signaling pathways involved in energy homeostasis,"Brian Maunze,Katherine Wood Bruckner,Nikhil Nilesh Desai,Christopher Chen,Fanghong Chen,David Baker,SuJean Choi,Brian Maunze,Katherine Wood Bruckner,Nikhil Nilesh Desai,Christopher Chen,Fanghong Chen,David Baker,SuJean Choi","Pituitary adenylate cyclase activating polypeptide (PACAP) exerts pleiotropic effects on ventromedial nuclei (VMN) of the hypothalamus and its control of feeding and energy expenditure through the type I PAC1 receptor (PAC1R). However, the endogenous role of PAC1Rs in the VMN and the downstream signaling responsible for PACAP's effects on energy balance are unknown. Numerous studies have revealed that PAC1Rs are coupled to both Gαs/adenylyl cyclase/protein kinase A (Gαs/AC/PKA) and Gαq/phospholipase C/protein kinase C (Gαq/PLC/PKC), while also undergoing trafficking following stimulation. To determine the endogenous role of PAC1Rs and downstream signaling that may explain PACAP's pleiotropic effects, we used RNA interference to knockdown VMN PAC1Rs and pharmacologically inhibited PKA, PKC, and PAC1R trafficking. Knocking down PAC1Rs increased meal sizes, reduced total number of meals, and induced body weight gain. Inhibition of either PKA or PKC alone in awake male Sprague-Dawley rats, attenuated PACAP's hypophagic and anorectic effects during the dark phase. However, PKA or PKC inhibition potentiated PACAP's thermogenic effects during the light phase. Analysis of locomotor activity revealed that PKA inhibition augmented PACAP's locomotor effects, whereas PKC inhibition had no effect. Finally, PACAP administration in the VMN induces surface PAC1R trafficking into the cytosol which was blocked by endocytosis inhibitors. Subsequently, inhibition of PAC1R trafficking into the cytosol attenuated PACAP-induced hypophagia. These results revealed that endogenous PAC1Rs uniquely engage PKA, PKC, and receptor trafficking to mediate PACAP's pleiotropic effects in VMN control of feeding and metabolism.NEW & NOTEWORTHY Endogenous PAC1 receptors, integral to VMN management of feeding behavior and body weight regulation, uniquely engage PKA, PKC, and receptor trafficking to mediate the hypothalamic ventromedial nuclei control of feeding and metabolism. PACAP appears to use different signaling mechanisms to regulate feeding behavior from its effects on metabolism."

The aim of this study was to assess impacts on air quality in Sao Paulo - Brazil, during the partial lockdown implemented to provide social distancing required due to the COVID-19 pandemic. We have analyzed data from four air quality stations in Sao Paulo, Brazil to assess air pollutant concentration variations during the partial lockdown. Data were compared to the five-year monthly mean and to the four-week before the partial lockdown. Overall, drastic reductions on NO (up to -77.3%), NO2 (up to -54.3%), and CO (up to -64.8%) concentrations were observed in the urban area during partial lockdown compared to the five-year monthly mean. By contrast, an increase of approximately 30% in ozone concentrations was observed in urban areas highly influenced by vehicle traffic, probably related to nitrogen monoxide decreases. Although the partial lockdown has contributed to a positive impact on air quality, it is important to take into account the negative impacts on social aspects, considering the deaths caused by COVID-19 and also the dramatic economic effects.

GBM is marked by local and systemic immunosuppression, contributing to resistance to existing immunotherapies that have had success in other tumor types. Memory T cells specific for previous infections reside in tissues throughout the host and are capable of rapid and potent immune activation. Here, we show that virus-specific memory CD8 + T cells expressing tissue-resident markers populate the mouse and human glioblastoma microenvironment. Reactivating virus-specific memory T cells through intratumoral delivery of adjuvant-free virus-derived peptide triggered local immune activation. This delivery translated to antineoplastic effects, which improved survival in a murine glioblastoma model. Our results indicate that virus-specific memory T cells are a significant part of the glioblastoma immune microenvironment and may be leveraged to promote anti-tumoral immunity."
1235,The Sustainable Development Goals prioritize economic growth over sustainable resource use: a critical reflection on the SDGs from a socio-ecological perspective,"Eisenmenger, Nina; Pichler, Melanie; Krenmayr, Nora; Noll, Dominik; Plank, Barbara; Schalmann, Ekaterina; Wandl, Marie-Theres; Gingrich, Simone","The sustainable development goals (SDGs) were adopted in 2015, succeeding the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). While the MDGs focused on improving well-being in the developing world, the 17 SDGs address all countries and aim at reconciling economic and social with ecological goals. We adopt a social ecology perspective and critically reflect on the SDGs' potential for monitoring, supporting, and bringing about a transformation towards sustainability. Starting from a literature review on the SDGs, we link empirical findings from social ecology with analyses of SDG targets and indicators. First, we find that the SDGs fail to monitor absolute trends in resource use and thus prioritize economic growth over ecological integrity. Second, we discuss the contradictions between economic growth and sustainable resource use in early and late stages of industrialization processes and show that they are responsible for important trade-offs among SDG targets. Third, we analyze the transformative potential of the SDGs with a focus on the actors and institutions addressed to bring about transformative change. We find that the SDGs rely mainly on those institutions responsible for unsustainable resource use, and partly propose measures that even reinforce current trends towards less sustainability. Despite ascertaining limited transformative potential to the SDGs from an analytical perspective, we conclude by stressing the strategic relevance of the SDGs for visions, research, and practices of statt towards transformative change towards sustainability."
1236,Modeling the role of environmental regulations in regional green economy efficiency of China: Empirical evidence from super efficiency DEA-Tobit model,"Shuai, Su; Fan, Zhang","This paper used the panel data of various regions in China from 2007 to 2018 and constructs a green economic efficiency measurement index system. Following this, the super-efficient DEA model has been employed to measure the efficiency of China's green economy. Then, the Tobit model is used to verify the environmental regulation influence on efficiency of China's regional green economy extent and direction. The results show that: (1) in 2007-2018, the green economy efficiency level of China's eastern, central and western regions is on the rise, accompanied by more obvious spatial differences. The green economy efficiency basically shows the spatial differentiation characteristics of the highest in the eastern region and the lowest in the western region. (2) From the national perspective, environmental regulation influence on efficiency of green economy presents a ""U"" shaped curve that promotes and then suppresses. At the eastern and national levels, environmental regulation has the same characteristics for green economy efficiency, and both exhibit U-shaped curve characteristics. Whereas, in the central and western regions shows negative correlation. (3) From the perspective of control variables, there are significant differences in variables at the national and regional levels. Finally, the study concludes with some policy suggestion for future green development and the formulation of environmental regulations in China."

For experimentation, two identical CSS having 1 m(2) basin area were used. In one of the still, modifications were done whereas, the other still is used for comparison. For energy analysis, a simple linear regression-based heat transfer model has been used. The exergy analysis has been performed to access the actual thermodynamic performance. Moreover, the cost per liter (CPL) of both the stills were evaluated. This study aims to make the solar still more productive, efficient, and economical by eliminating the chances of over misting during low radiation hours. This is done with the help of a cotton cloth, which is mounted on the frame (like a tent). Also, it helps in reducing the characteristic dimension of still. Modified solar still (MSS) has yielded 53.12% higher in comparison to the conventional. In the evening hours, MSS yielded more in comparison to CSS. The CPL of potable water produced from MSS is 27.46% lower in comparison to CSS. The overall efficiency of MSS is 44.64% higher than CSS."

The objective of the current study was to assess the effects of kolaviron on islet dynamics in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats. Using double immunolabeling of glucagon and insulin, we identified insulin-producing β- and glucagon-producing α-cells in the islets of diabetic and control rats and determined the fractional β-cell area, α-cell area and islet number. STZ challenged rats presented with islet hypoplasia and reduced β-cell area concomitant with an increase in α-cell area. Kolaviron restored some islet architecture in diabetic rats through the increased β-cell area. Overall, kolaviron-treated diabetic rats presented a significant (p < 0.05) increase in the number of large and very large islets compared to diabetic control but no difference in islet number and α-cell area. The β-cell replenishment potential of kolaviron and its overall positive effects on glycemic control suggest that it may be a viable target for diabetes treatment."

DCM initially presents as diastolic relaxation dysfunction and will progress to heart failure in the absence of coronary artery disease, valvular disease, and other conventional cardiovascular risk factors such as hypertension and dyslipidemia. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms of DCM are poorly understood. Recent studies reveal that exosomal miRNAs are associated with multiple DCM risk factors and may act as potential therapeutic targets. Therefore, this review summarizes the recent advancements to understand the role of exosomal miRNAs in DCM development and explores potential preventative and therapeutic strategies."

This study examined how pineapple modified the expression of drug-metabolizing enzymes (CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP3A4, UGT1A6, NAT2 and SULT1A1) and a drug transporter (OATP1B1) in human hepatocarcinoma (HepG2) cells. &lt;b&gt;Materials and Methods:&lt;/b&gt; HepG2 cells (2.5×10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; cells/well in a 24-well plate) were incubated with pineapple juice extract (125-1,000 μg mL&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;) for 48 hrs in phenol red-free medium. Resazurin reduction, ROS, AST and ALT assays were performed. The mRNA expression of target genes was determined by RT/qPCR. &lt;b&gt;Results:&lt;/b&gt; Pineapple juice slightly reduced HepG2 cell viability to 80% of the control, while ROS, AST and ALT levels were not changed. Pineapple juice did not alter the expression of CYP1A2, CYP2C9 and UGT1A6 mRNA. All tested concentrations of pineapple juice suppressed CYP3A4, NAT2 and OATP1B1 expression, while SULT1A1 expression was induced. &lt;b&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/b&gt; Though pineapple juice slightly decreased the viability of HepG2 cells, cell morphology and cell function remained normal. Pineapple juice disturbed the expression of phase I (CYP3A4) and phase II (NAT2 and SULT1A1) metabolizing genes and the drug transporter OATP1B1. Therefore, the consumption of excessive amounts of pineapple juice poses a risk for drug interactions."
1241,Sustainable development goal disclosures: Do they support responsible consumption and production?,"Gunawan, Juniati; Permatasari, Paulina; Tilt, Carol","Corporate social responsibility (CSR) is one of the tools used to achieve sustainable development goals (SDGs). The purpose of this paper is to examine whether CSR activities in Indonesian companies support and align to the SDGs, especially in achieving the goal of responsible consumption and production. The data was collected from 453 annual reports and 44 sustainability reports of Indonesian listed companies from 2014 until 2016. The total data observation was from 585 reports. Content analysis was applied to examine the disclosures in both the annual and sustainability reports. Firstly, the analysis targeted sustainability reports. However, due to the limited number of sustainability reports, annual reports were also analyzed for the most recent year when this study was undertaken, which was 2016. The 2016 annual report content analysis shows that Indonesian companies tend to support the achievement of (1) sustainable cities and communities, (2) good health and well-being, (3) decent work and economic growth, (4) responsible consumption and production, and (5) quality education. The content analysis results for the 2014-2016 sustainability reports were found to be similar to the annual report analysis, albeit in a different order: (1) good health and well-being, (2) quality education, (3) sustainable cities and communities, (4) decent work and economic growth, and (5) responsible consumption and production. In short, based on both the annual and sustainability reports, Indonesian companies are likely to support these five SDG priorities. SDG goals are expected to be in line with the country's commitment. However the support from the companies is not yet aligned to the SDG priorities selected in Indonesia. The results from this analysis can be used to encourage the Government to socialize and provide an understanding of SDGs and the country's commitment to Indonesian companies. In addition, this study can be used to draw useful perspectives, not only for the Indonesian Government, but also for the other 193 countries that have adopted the SDGs. The results should encourage companies to implement business activities, in particular CSR activities that incorporate the SDG priority development targets. Also, this study can be a platform to provide a comprehensive picture to support SDGs, particularly in achieving the targets for responsible consumption and production. Other countries are expected to start examining their business activities, including CSR programs, in order to support and align with the country's SDG targets. This evaluation is important, as the SDG initiative will soon be reaching the first one third of the 2030 target implementation timeframe, so time cannot be wasted. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

1242,Monitoring cropland abandonment with Landsat time series,"Yin, He; Brandao, Amintas, Jr.; Buchner, Johanna; Helmers, David; Iuliano, Benjamin G.; Kimambo, Niwaeli E.; Lewinska, Katarzyna E.; Razenkova, Elena; Rizayeva, Afag; Rogova, Natalia; Spawn, Seth A.; Xie, Yanhua; Radeloff, Volker C.","Cropland abandonment is a widespread land-use change, but it is difficult to monitor with remote sensing because it is often spatially dispersed, easily confused with spectrally similar land-use classes such as grasslands and fallow fields, and because post-agricultural succession can take different forms in different biomes. Due to these difficulties, prior assessments of cropland abandonment have largely been limited in resolution, extent, or both. However, cropland abandonment has wide-reaching consequences for the environment, food production, and rural livelihoods, which is why new approaches to monitor long-term cropland abandonment in different biomes accurately are needed. Our goals were to 1) develop a new approach to map the extent and the timing of abandoned cropland using the entire Landsat time series, and 2) test this approach in 14 study regions across the globe that capture a wide range of environmental conditions as well as the three major causes of abandonment, i.e., social, economic, and environmental factors. Our approach was based on annual maps of active cropland and non-cropland areas using Landsat summary metrics for each year from 1987 to 2017. We streamlined per-pixel classifications by generating multi-year training data that can be used for annual classification. Based on the annual classifications, we analyzed land-use trajectories of each pixel in order to distinguish abandoned cropland, stable cropland, non-cropland, and fallow fields. In most study regions, our new approach separated abandoned cropland accurately from stable cropland and other classes. The classification accuracy for abandonment was highest in regions with industrialized agriculture (area-adjusted F1 score for Mato Grosso in Brazil: 0.8; Volgograd in Russia: 0.6), and drylands (e.g., Shaanxi in China, Nebraska in the U.S.: 0.5) where fields were large or spectrally distinct from non-cropland. Abandonment of subsistence agriculture with small field sizes (e.g., Nepal: 0.1) or highly variable climate (e.g., Sardinia in Italy: 0.2) was not accurately mapped. Cropland abandonment occurred in all study regions but was especially prominent in developing countries and formerly socialist states. In summary, we present here an approach for monitoring cropland abandonment with Landsat imagery, which can be applied across diverse biomes and may thereby improve the understanding of the drivers and consequences of this important land-use change process."

Patients on dialysis are at a high risk of severe disease, given abnormal immune responses that can lead to prolonged inflammation. Moreover, patients undergoing dialysis have limited treatment options, as neither remdesivir nor baricitinib is available. The novel neutralizing monoclonal antibody cocktail REGEN-COV (formerly known as REGN-COV2; casirivimab/imdevimab), recently approved in Japan, is a promising drug for preventing severe diseases. However, there are few reports regarding its use in patients undergoing dialysis in Japan. Herein, we report the safe use of antibody cocktail therapy in patients with COVID-19 on hemodialysis receiving maintenance dialysis in Japan. Infusion reactions were not observed during administration. Due to the increasing number of patients with COVID-19 and the limited capacity of the healthcare system, antibody cocktail therapy needs to be enhanced. Antibody cocktail therapy for severe diseases can be safely administered to patients undergoing dialysis who do not require supplemental oxygen."

A 48-year-old woman with acute SPMS being treated with interferon beta-1a and oral corticosteroids presented as a clinical outpatient with no disease-modifying effects after treatment. A decision was made to treat her with a combination of guanidinoacetate and creatine for 21 days. She had made clinical progress at follow-up, with the intensity of fatigue dropping from severe to mild. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy revealed increased brain choline, creatine, N-acetylaspartate, and glutathione. Patients with SPMS may benefit from guanidinoacetate-creatine treatment in terms of patient- and clinician-reported outcomes; this requires additional study."
1246,"New media environment, environmental information disclosure and firm valuation: Evidence from high-polluting enterprises in China","Fan, Liu; Yang, Kaili; Liu, Liping","With firms gradually becoming the subject for energy consumption and environment pollution, it is pivotal that they disclose corporate environmental information for social supervision and fulfillment of social responsibility. Thus, it has been a hot topic as to how to improve the quality of corporate environmental information disclosure (EID). Drawing on the data of listed companies in the high-polluting industries between 2014 and 2017 in China, this paper conducts an empirical study on three questions with an in-depth investigation: (1) does the new media environment help in improving corporate EID quality; (2) whether this relationship is influenced by the property ownership of the corporate and local economic pressure; (3) what is the economic consequence of corporate EID. Our findings indicate that new media environment has a significantly positive effect on corporate EID quality, especially to state-owned enterprises. And firms with higher environmental disclosure quality enjoy better firm valuation. These findings help identify new driving factors of corporate EID and confirm that new media environment has performed a supplementary role in regulating corporate environmental behaviors, which can help develop green finance and promote ecological civilization.

1247,How will the Chinese national carbon emissions trading scheme work? The assessment of regional potential gains,"Chen, Zhenling; Yuan, Xiao-Chen; Zhang, Xiaoling; Cao, Yunfei","The implementation of a national emissions trading scheme (ETS) in China is likely to have an important effect on potential regional gains. This study proposes a unified analytical framework for anticipating such gains in 2020 and estimates the key factors involved using data envelopment analysis based models. The results indicate that: (1) when the value of the marginal abatement cost is higher than the carbon price, no regions will have an incentive to reduce emissions by technological improvements. The only source of direct potential gains is from the amounts of carbon quota. (2) As carbon price increases from CNY 10 to 4000 per ton, the indirect potential gains will increase because the strategies for carbon reduction are technological innovation or limit economic activities. However, Jiangsu and Shanghai will suffer potential losses even though the price is high because they have no more carbon reduction potential. (3) Most central provinces will have potential gains when the carbon price is lower in ETS, while regions rich in fossil energy sources will suffer potential losses. However, a middle-price interval of CNY 1000-2000/ton is more rational, because it helps motivate market transactions and benefits low-carbon technological innovations."
1248,Assessment of Green Methanol Production Potential and Related Economic and Environmental Benefits: The Case of China,"Bazaluk, Oleg; Havrysh, Valerii; Nitsenko, Vitalii; Balezentis, Tomas; Streimikiene, Dalia; Tarkhanova, Elena A.","Adopting a new paradigm for social development implies a transition to a circular economy. The above requires the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, the utilization of wastes, and the use of renewable energy sources. The most promising way is the use of methanol for industrial and transport applications. China is experiencing a boom in methanol production and its use in almost every sector of the economy. The purpose of this study was to reveal economic benefits, carbon dioxide emissions and the potential production of green methanol. Fuel price history, energy costs and fuel economy were used for economic assessment. Life cycle analysis to evaluate carbon dioxide emissions was applied. It was revealed that only the use of green methanol as a fuel results in decreases in well-to-wheel CO(2)emissions compared to fossil fuels. The potential methanol production by using recycled waste and wind power was determined. Its annual production can range from 6.83 to 32.43 million tones. On this basis, a gradual transition to a circular and methanol economy is possible. Policymakers are recommended to support green methanol production in China. It can result in boosting the application of vehicles fueled by methanol and can control CO(2)emissions."
1249,Willingness to pay for hydrogen fuel cell electric vehicles in China: A choice experiment analysis,"Li, Wenbo; Long, Ruyin; Chen, Hong; Chen, Feiyu; Zheng, Xiao; He, Zhengxia; Zhang, Linling","The hydrogen energy is considered to be main power source of transport sector in the future, and a huge amount of funds have been invested into developing hydrogen fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs). Since FCEVs are in initial development stage and there're few FCEVs on the road, before their expansion this paper intends to conduct an economic analysis for FCEVs by using the choice experiment method. In the choice experiment, 1072 participants were required to select among two FCEVs and one conventional fuel vehicle. Logit models were estimated and then the results were used to calculate the willingness to pay for FCEVs. Results showed that purchase price, driving range, refueling time, fuel cost, emissions reduction, refueling accessibility are significant influences, and the marginal values for every 200 km improvement in driving range, 5 min reduction in refueling time, RMB 0.5/kilometer reduction in fuel cost, 20% reduction in emissions, and 20% improvement of refueling accessibility were estimated to be RMB 49,091, 12,727, 3818, 47,818, and 12,909, respectively. A range of FCEV configurations were calculated, and compared to a gasoline-powered counterpart the extra value that customers were likely to pay for a FCEV ranged from RMB 20,810 to 95,310. These results have significant implications for promoting FCEVs and contribute to better sustainability in transport sector. (C) 2020 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

1250,Trade and technological innovation: The catalysts for climate change and way forward for COP21,"Su, Chi-Wei; Naqvi, Bushra; Shao, Xue-Feng; Li, Jing-Ping; Jiao, Zhilun","Following the adaptation of the Paris Agreement at COP21, it was noted that the traditional measures of carbon emissions have several limitations; and a reliable and relevant carbon emissions measurement is important to formulate a response to the challenge of climate change. This study, therefore, explores the relationship between international trade and consumption-based carbon emissions, which is a trade adjusted indicator; and measures the outflow and the inflow of emissions through exports and imports separately. We also include technological innovation in the model to understand its impact on consumption-based carbon emissions. The results show that exports and consumption-based carbon emissions are negatively associated, and technological innovation helps reducing the adverse effect of CO2 growth. In contrast, Imports and gross domestic product are positively linked with consumption-based carbon emissions. The findings also suggest the countries which embraced the Paris Climate Agreement must focus on consumption-based carbon emissions rather than the production-based carbon emissions."
1251,A Deep Learning Approach for Burned Area Segmentation with Sentinel-2 Data,"Knopp, Lisa; Wieland, Marc; Raettich, Michaela; Martinis, Sandro","Wildfires have major ecological, social and economic consequences. Information about the extent of burned areas is essential to assess these consequences and can be derived from remote sensing data. Over the last years, several methods have been developed to segment burned areas with satellite imagery. However, these methods mostly require extensive preprocessing, while deep learning techniques-which have successfully been applied to other segmentation tasks-have yet to be fully explored. In this work, we combine sensor-specific and methodological developments from the past few years and suggest an automatic processing chain, based on deep learning, for burned area segmentation using mono-temporal Sentinel-2 imagery. In particular, we created a new training and validation dataset, which is used to train a convolutional neural network based on a U-Net architecture. We performed several tests on the input data and reached optimal network performance using the spectral bands of the visual, near infrared and shortwave infrared domains. The final segmentation model achieved an overall accuracy of 0.98 and a kappa coefficient of 0.94."
1252,Composite dietary antioxidant index and the risk of colorectal cancer: Findings from the Singapore Chinese Health Study,"Yi-Chuan Yu,Pedram Paragomi,Renwei Wang,Aizhen Jin,Robert E Schoen,Li-Ting Sheng,An Pan,Woon-Puay Koh,Jian-Min Yuan,Hung N Luu,Yi-Chuan Yu,Pedram Paragomi,Renwei Wang,Aizhen Jin,Robert E Schoen,Li-Ting Sheng,An Pan,Woon-Puay Koh,Jian-Min Yuan,Hung N Luu","Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a major contributor to cancer death globally. Several studies showed some protections by certain individual dietary antioxidants against CRC development. Epidemiologic data on the composite dietary antioxidant index (CDAI) in relation to CRC risk are sparse. Using the Singapore Chinese Health Study, an ongoing prospective cohort consisting of 61 321 cancer-free participants aged 45 to 74 years at baseline, a food-based CDAI was calculated according to a previously established and validated method that included six food-sourced antioxidants including vitamins A, C and E, manganese, selenium and zinc. Cox proportional hazard regression method was used to estimate the hazard ratios (HRs) and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for CRC associated with various levels of CDAI with adjustment for multiple potential confounders. After an average of 17.5 years of follow-up, 2140 participants developed CRC. HRs (95% CIs) of CRC for quartiles 2, 3 and 4 of CDAI were 0.94 (0.83-1.07), 0.86 (0.75-1.00) and 0.80 (0.66-0.98), respectively, compared to the lowest quartile (Ptrend = .02). This inverse association between CDAI and CRC risk was more apparent in women or those without a history of diabetes, without family history of CRC, never smokers or overweight/obese individuals. However, none of the heterogeneity tests for the CDAI-CRC risk association reached statistical significance. Our findings suggest that food-based antioxidants may be beneficial for reducing the risk of CRC in the general population."

Organic pesticides, based on plant products have emerged as eco-benign nematicidal agents. Ceriops tagal is a well-known marine medicinal plant which has not been evaluated against any nematode. Petroleum ether extract of the aerial parts of the plant (CTP), exhibited promising activity against infective stage larvae of H. zeae. On subjecting to classical solvent-solvent separation, it afforded petroleum ether soluble (CTP-S), methanol soluble (CTPMS-1, CTPMS-2) and insoluble (CTPM-IN-2) fractions, which exhibited activity against the cyst nematode within 24 h exposure. GC, GC/MS and HR-ESI-MS analyses of CTPMS-1 and CTPMS-2 fractions resulted in the identification of a number of compounds, including pentacyclic triterpenoids, lupeol (1), betunal (2), betulin (3), lupenone (4), betulonaldehyde (5), betulonic acid (7), methyl 3-acetoxy-27-O-(3,4-dihydroxy-E-cinnamoyl)-20(29)-lupen-28-oate (8) and β-amyrin, along with phenylpropanoid esters, fatty acids and their derivatives, benzamide, and indole derivatives. CTPM-IN-2 which mainly contained lupeol (1) exhibited maximum nematicidal activity, with 91 % and 93 % mortality of the larvae of H. zeae, after exposure for 72 h at the concentration of 0.5 % and 1 %, respectively. Its fractionation and purification through column chromatography resulted in the isolation and identification of four lupane-type triterpenoids 1, 3, 4 and betulinic acid (6). One of its most abundant column fractions CC-9-18 (145 mg) which exhibited substantial activity, with 81 % mortality at the lowest concentration of 0.125 % after 48 h of incubation mainly contained lupeol. It seems lupeol, a wide spread bio-privileged triterpenoid is the nematicidal principle of the plant as its authentic sample showed LC50 value of 0.061 after 72 h exposure. It is for the first time that nematicidal activity is reported for any part of C. tagal and that of lupeol against H. zeae. Pentacyclic triterpenoids 1-8 are biosynthetically related. Of the twenty-four compounds isolated or identified in the present investigation only five constituents 1, 3, 6, 7 and palmitic acid have been isolated previously from C. tagal."

1255,"Construction of ecological security pattern based on the importance of ecosystem service functions and ecological sensitivity assessment: a case study in Fengxian County of Jiangsu Province, China","Jin, Xingxing; Wei, Luyao; Wang, Yi; Lu, Yuqi","The construction of ecological security pattern is one of the important ways to alleviate the contradiction between economic development and ecological protection, as well as the important contents of ecological civilization construction. How to scientifically construct the ecological security pattern of small-scale counties, and achieve sustainable economic development based on ecological environment protection, it has become an important proposition in regulating the ecological process effectively. Taking Fengxian County of China as an example, this paper selected the importance of ecosystem service functions and ecological sensitivity to evaluate the ecological importance and identify ecological sources. Furthermore, we constructed the ecological resistance surface by various landscape assignments and nighttime lighting modifications. Through a minimum cumulative resistance model, we obtained ecological corridors and finally constructed the ecological security pattern comprehensively combining with ecological resistance surface construction. Accordingly, we further clarified the specific control measures for ecological security barriers and regional functional zoning. This case study shows that the ecological security pattern is composed of ecological sources and corridors, where the former plays an important security role, and the latter ensures the continuity of ecological functions. In terms of the spatial layout, the ecological security barriers built based on ecological security pattern and regional zoning functions are away from the urban core development area. As for the spatial distribution, ecological sources of Fengxian County are mainly located in the central and southwestern areas, which is highly coincident with the main rivers and underground drinking water source area. Moreover, key corridors and main corridors with length of approximately 115.71 km and 26.22 km, respectively, formed ecological corridors of Fengxian County. They are concentrated in the western and southwestern regions of the county which is far away from the built-up areas with strong human disturbance. The results will provide scientific evidence for important ecological land protection and ecological space control at a small scale in underdeveloped and plain counties. In addition, it will enrich the theoretical framework and methodological system of ecological security pattern construction. To some extent, it also makes a reference for improving the regional ecological environment carrying capacities and optimizing the ecological spatial structure in such kinds of underdeveloped small-scale counties."
1256,The Importance of Renewable Energy Sources in Poland's Energy Mix,"Marks-Bielska, Renata; Bielski, Stanislaw; Pik, Katarzyna; Kurowska, Krystyna","Exploitation of renewable energy sources for power generation has been more and more important in recent years. This results from the economic issues and the measures taken to ensure the energy security. The aim of this research was to determine the significance of renewable energy sources (RES) in the energy mix of Poland, and to elicit the opinions and the level of knowledge of the society on the use and development of non-conventional energy. The article also presents advantages and disadvantages of types of RES, the obstacles which hinder the progress of green energy in Poland, and the proposed measures to expand the share of the RES in the overall energy mix. The research relied on the statistical data gathered by Statistics Poland. The opinions of respondents were elicited through a diagnostic survey based on a questionnaire. The research has demonstrated that the respondents support the development of RES in Poland. However, they also maintain that the purchase and installation of devices for the production of non-conventional energy are too expensive. The respondents believe that in order to increase the number of green power plants, subsidies to encourage RES investment and tax reliefs related to this investment should be bigger."
1257,Do energy technology innovations contribute to CO2 emissions abatement? A spatial perspective,"Wang, Zilong; Zhu, Yongfeng","With growing concerns about global warming, energy technology innovation has attracted attention from scholars. Many studies have explored the relationship between energy technology innovations and energy consumption, while the influence of energy technology innovation on carbon emissions (CEs) has not received enough attention. Utilizing the spatial econometric model, this study aims to examine whether energy technology innovations are beneficial for CO2 emissions abatement in China. The results indicate that, first, renewable energy technology innovation facilitates CO2 abatement, while fossil energy technology innovation is ineffective in reducing CEs. Second, the influences of energy technology innovations on CEs are trans-regional. Third, economic growth would agglomerate CEs from low-growth province to neighboring high-growth provinces; mandatory environmental regulation in China would transfer CEs from provinces with strict regulations to neighboring provinces with loose regulation. Based on these findings, a series of policy recommendations are put forward to tackle China's CEs. One possible innovation is that this study considers geographic location when investigating how energy technology innovations affect CEs. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."
1258,Exploring the capacity of renewable energy consumption to reduce outdoor air pollution death rate in Latin America and the Caribbean region,"Koengkan, Matheus; Fuinhas, Jose Alberto; Silva, Nuno","The impact of renewable energy consumption on reducing the outdoor air pollution death rate, in nineteen Latin America & the Caribbean countries, from 1990 to 2016, using the econometric technique of quantile regression for panel data, was researched. Results show that economic growth and fossil fuel consumption are positively related to CO(2)emissions, while renewable energy consumption bears a negative relationship with it. Furthermore, fossil fuel consumption has a positive impact on the mortality rate and economic growth a negative one. The negative effect of renewable energy consumption on the mortality rate is only observable on the right tail of its distribution. The modelisation reveals two ways in which the consumption of renewable energy can reduce the outdoor air pollution death rates: (i) directly, by increasing renewable energies, and (i) indirectly because the increase in the consumption of renewable energies implies a decrease in the consumption of energy from fossil fuels. The phenomenon of increasing urbanisation is a point where the action of public policymakers is decisive for the reduction of outdoor air pollution death rates. Here, the question is not to reduce the level of urbanisation but to act on the ""quality"" of urbanisation, to make cities healthier. The research concludes that public policymakers must focus on intensifying the transition from fossil to renewable energies and improving the quality of cities."

Despite host cell iron regulatory machineries attempts to deny supply of this essential micronutrient, intraphagosomal M.tb continues to access extracellular iron. In the current study, we report that intracellular M.tb exploits mammalian secreted Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (sGAPDH) for the delivery of host iron carrier proteins lactoferrin (Lf) and transferrin (Tf). Studying the trafficking of iron carriers in infected cells we observed that sGAPDH along with the iron carrier proteins are preferentially internalized into infected cells and trafficked to M.tb containing phagosomes where they are internalized by resident mycobacteria resulting in iron delivery. Collectively our findings provide a new mechanism of iron acquisition by M.tb involving the hijack of host sGAPDH. This may contribute to its successful pathogenesis and provide an option for targeted therapeutic intervention."

Previous studies have focused on creating regional solar maps or estimating the irradiation of building roofs. This study estimates the practical potential of solar energy in cities with a novel roof-facade framework. Improvements have been made to make it more practical by integrating roofs and facades, considering view shading effects, and correcting weather impacts. The developed framework was applied to calculate the solar energy potential for 10 cities in China on a microscopic scale. The annual solar irradiation ranges from 41.39 to 772.94 TWh, with an electric capacity of 6.21-115.94 TWh. A dataset of the annual solar irradiation for more than 1.44 million buildings of the 10 cities is now available as a free download (http://gis.nju.edu.cn/rs_01.asp?ID=74&type_1=425).

1261,Does increasing investment in research and development promote economic growth decoupling from carbon emission growth? An empirical analysis of BRICS countries,"Wang, Qiang; Zhang, Fuyu","It is generally recognized that increasing research and development investment is an effective measure to promote economic and social progress. An open question is if increasing research and development investment help economic growth decoupling from carbon emission. This study investigates research and development investment and carbon emission in BRICS countries by using the Fully Modified Ordinary Least Squares for empirical estimation from 1996 to 2014. The results show that every 1% increase in research and development investment, carbon emissions will be decreased by 0.8122% for the BRICS as a whole, which indicates increasing research and development investment has a positive impact on decoupling economic growth from environmental pressure. For individual, this impact is most significant in China, weak in Russia and India. However, it also should be noted that only increasing research and development investment cannot achieve the decoupling between economic growth and carbon emission, because other factors, such as economic activity, industrialization and urbanization, renewable energy also influences the decoupling economic growth from carbon emission. The results also show that economic activity, industrialization and urbanization pose negative impact on the decoupling, whereas renewable energy consumption promote the decoupling.

1262,Sustainable development evaluation of the society-economy-environment in a resource-based city of China:A complex network approach,"Jing, Zhaorui; Wang, Jinman","Resource-based cities (RBCs) have made a significant contribution to country development in certain historical periods. Achieving sustainable development of the society-economy-environment system has been the key issue in the RBCs development process because resources are being depleted. At present, the studies on sustainable development of the society-economy-environment system of RBCs are insufficient. Moreover, the relevant research method is lacking. Therefore, this study introduced complex network method to dynamically and systematically analyze the development process of a typical RBC (Shuozhou) in China from 1989 to 2016. In this study, a theoretical framework of RBCs sustainable development was proposed and the evaluation indicator system was established from three aspects: social harmony, economic development, and environmental improvement. The important nodes of the complex network (e.g., population, regional gross domestic product, green infrastructure land) were identified by the degree, closeness centrality, and betweenness centrality. The whole society-economy eenvironment system had maximum connectivity and information transmission efficiency compared with an individual society, economy, or environment subsystem. Moreover, the stability of the complex network of the society-economy-environment system in Period III (2008-2016) was higher compared with other two periods. Based on the knowledge of the societyeeconomyeenvironment system's complex network structure and interrelationships, population adjustments in quantity and quality, a moderate increase in consumption, and industrial adjustment are critical measures for social and economic sustainable development of RBCs. Moreover, the government should focus on the proportional relationship among green infrastructure land, forest land, and other lands and increase the vegetation coverage rate. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

It includes 'Base case' comprising a 3 m(3) High Volume V-shape Pond (HVVP) and 'Projected case(s)' in million liters per day (MLD) treatment capacity plant of <= 0.25, similar to 0.5 and >= 1.0 MLD dairy industries for 10-, 20- and 30-yrs lifetime span, respectively. Economic analysis includes capital expenditure (CapEx), operational expenditure (OpEx), payback period, internal rate of return (IRR), net present value and minimum biomass production price. As expected, centrifuge and its electricity consumption charges are major contributors of CapEx and OpEx, respectively. >= 1 MLD plant for 20 yrs showed most feasible with an IRR and payback period of 118% and 1.9 yrs, respectively. Annual algal production was 504 ton at $0.482/kg with similar to 240,000 m(3) of treated clean water. HVVP is found to be one of the cost-effective and area efficient microalgal cultivation systems for mass production. Besides, the process aids in resolving environmental concerns associated with current practices of direct discharge of dairy effluents. This study aims to overcome some of the key hindering factors viz., high land foot-print and cost-intensive cultivation systems that are associated in commercialization of microalgae production.

This study proposes a novel approach that systematically changes the background processes in a prospective LCA based on scenarios of an integrated assessment model (IAM), the IMAGE model. Consistent worldwide scenarios from IMAGE are evaluated in the life cycle inventory using ecoinvent v3.3. To test the approach, only the electricity sector was changed in a prospective LCA of an internal combustion engine vehicle (ICEV) and an electric vehicle (EV) using six baseline and mitigation climate scenarios until 2050. This case study shows that changes in the electricity background can be very important for the environmental impacts of EV. Also, the approach demonstrates that the relative environmental performance of EV and ICEV over time is more complex and multifaceted than previously assumed. Uncertainty due to future developments manifests in different impacts depending on the product (EV or ICEV), the impact category, and the scenario and year considered. More robust prospective LCAs can be achieved, particularly for emerging technologies, by expanding this approach to other economic sectors beyond electricity background changes and mobility applications as well as by including uncertainty and changes in foreground parameters. A more systematic and structured composition of future inventory databases driven by IAM scenarios helps to acknowledge epistemological uncertainty and to increase the temporal consistency of foreground and background systems in LCAs of emerging technologies."

However, studies observing growth at sub-daily temporal scales remain scarce. We analysed sub-daily growth dynamics and its climatic drivers recorded by point dendrometers for 35 trees of three temperate broadleaved species during the years 2015-2020. We isolated irreversible growth driven by cambial activity from the dendrometer records. Next, we compared the intra-annual growth patterns among species and delimited their climatic optima. The growth of all species peaked at air temperatures between 12 and 16°C and vapour pressure deficit (VPD) below 0.1 kPa. Acer pseudoplatanus and Fagus sylvatica, both diffuse-porous, sustained growth under suboptimal VPD. Ring-porous Quercus robur experienced a steep decline of growth rates with reduced air humidity. This resulted in multiple irregular growth peaks of Q. robur during the year. By contrast, the growth patterns of the diffuse-porous species were always right-skewed unimodal with a peak in June between day of the year 150-170. Intra-annual growth patterns are shaped more by VPD than temperature. The different sensitivity of radial growth to VPD is responsible for unimodal growth patterns in both diffuse-porous species and multimodal growth pattern in Q. robur."

Cognitive gaps in EMS clinicians' understanding of the differences between pediatric and adult airway anatomy and respiratory physiology and pathology, variability in the training provided to EMS clinicians, and decay of the psychomotor skills necessary to safely and effectively manage pediatric patients experiencing respiratory emergencies collectively pose significant threats to the quality and safety of care delivered to pediatric patients. NAEMSP recommends:Pediatric airway education should include discussion of the factors that make pediatric airway management challenging.EMS agencies should provide pediatric-specific education that addresses recognition and treatment of pediatric respiratory distress based upon pathophysiology affecting upper airways, lower airways, cardiovascular systems, or extrinsic causes of disordered breathing. Pediatric airway training should also differentiate between hypoxic and hypercapnic respiratory failure. Education should emphasize that the cognitive and psychomotor skills requisite in management of pediatric respiratory emergencies will differ across patient age groups.EMS clinicians should be provided education and training in technology-dependent children and children and youth with special health care needs.EMS clinicians should receive initial and ongoing education and training in pediatric airway and respiratory conditions that emphasizes the principle of using the least invasive most effective strategies to achieve oxygenation and ventilation.Initial and continuing pediatric-focused education should be structured to maintain EMS clinician competency in the assessment and management of pediatric airway and respiratory emergencies and should be provided on a recurring basis to mitigate the decay of EMS clinicians' knowledge and skills that occurs due to infrequent field-based clinical exposure.Integration of clinician education programs with quality management programs is essential for the development and delivery of initial and continuing education intended to help EMS clinicians attain and maintain proficiency in pediatric airway and respiratory management."
1268,Factors influencing fake news rebuttal acceptance during the COVID-19 pandemic and the moderating effect of cognitive ability,"Xin Wang,Fan Chao,Guang Yu,Kaihang Zhang,Xin Wang,Fan Chao,Guang Yu,Kaihang Zhang","Fake news is spreading rapidly on social media and poses a serious threat to the COVID-19 outbreak response. This study thus aims to reveal the factors influencing the acceptance of fake news rebuttals on Sina Weibo. Drawing on the elaboration likelihood model (ELM), we used text mining and the econometrics method to investigate the relationships among the central route (rebuttal's information readability and argument quality), peripheral route (rebuttal's source credibility, including authority and influence), and rebuttal acceptance, as well as the moderating effect of receiver's cognitive ability on these relationships. Our findings suggest that source authority had a negative effect on rebuttal acceptance, while source influence had a positive effect. Second, both information readability and argument quality had positive effects on rebuttal acceptance. In addition, individuals with low cognitive abilities relied more on source credibility and argument quality to accept rebuttals, while individuals with high cognitive abilities relied more on information readability. This study can provide decision support for practitioners to establish more effective fake news rebuttal strategies; it is especially valuable to reduce the negative impact of fake news related to major public health emergencies and safeguard the implementation of anti-epidemic strategies."

1270,Stakeholder Perspectives on Implementing a Police-Mental Health Collaborative to Improve Pathways to Treatment,"Anna Davidson Abella,Monica Landers,Flandra Ismajli,Yaritza Carmona,Anna Davidson Abella,Monica Landers,Flandra Ismajli,Yaritza Carmona","High rates of criminal justice involvement among individuals with mental illness have led to collaborative efforts between law enforcement agencies and mental health providers to improve crisis responses and pathways to treatment. The development and implementation of these police-mental health collaborations (PMHCs) have received little attention in the literature, but these processes are crucial in understanding feasibility and sustainability. The PMHC discussed here is an interagency effort to identify individuals involved with law enforcement who have unmet behavioral health needs and engage them in services. Perspectives from leaders, service providers, and clients highlight the importance of developing PMHCs that support individuals with serious mental illness at multiple points, from initial crisis to independent management of treatment. In an environment where police responses to individuals with mental health and substance use disorders are increasingly scrutinized, it is critical to highlight and evaluate ways that behavioral health and law enforcement agencies work together to collaboratively address these problems."
1271,"Comparative analysis of modular construction practices in mainland China, Hong Kong and Singapore","Xu, Zhao; Zayed, Tarek; Niu, Yumin","Modular construction is considered as the future of the construction industry. While the sector is growing rapidly in some areas, there are still barriers to overcome. For more than two decades, several regions and countries, such as mainland China, Hong Kong, and Singapore, were using prefabricated/ precast components to construct high-rise buildings in both private and public sectors. Such practices suffered from several limitations, which warrant the need for modular construction. Modular construction method needs to evolve so as to meet different regional requirements and restrictions, namely regulations, economy, market and building types. But the regional requirements and constraints on adopting modular construction remain unexplored. These differences are not widely appreciated. Hence, this research aims to perform comparative analysis of modular construction practices in terms of policies, specifications, and real projects in Hong Kong, Singapore, and mainland China. The results of the comparative analysis indicate that Singapore has developed a relatively effective policy system to help the construction industry embrace modular construction, while the three regions have not issued authoritative specifications. In general, modular construction still needs more support from the government, especially in terms of technical guidance and innovation. Cases studies show that the sustainability performance of modular construction is not balanced in terms of the economic, social and environmental dimensions. The lessons and challenges of modular construction drawn from the cases are also summarized. The construction industry should work closely with the government to achieve sustainable construction of modular building. The developed research on modular construction will increase the understanding of common practices in close countries where the industry in each can benefit from such practices to advance the domain.

1272,"A disaggregated-level analysis of the relationship among energy production, energy consumption and economic growth: Evidence from China","Rahman, Zia Ur; Khattak, Shoukat Iqbal; Ahmad, Manzoor; Khan, Anwar","The purpose of this study is to explore the relationship between energy production, energy consumption, and gross domestic product (GDP) growth in China for the period 1981-2016 (at the disaggregate level). The results of the Hatemi-J cointegration and structural-break tests supported long-term co-integration in the consumption and production of coal, oil, and natural gas. Based on the three models (coal, oil, and natural gas) of energy production and consumption, the fully-modified least square (FMOLS) method results confirmed the presence of long-term positive impact of the consumption and production of coal, oil, and natural gas on GDP growth. The CCR model estimations for robustness were found to be consistent with the FMLOS estimations. The vector error correction mechanism (VECM) based Granger-causality tests identified a one-way causality run from coal production and coal consumption to GDP growth; from GDP growth to gas consumption (supporting conservation hypothesis); from natural gas production to natural gas consumption; and from oil production and oil consumption to GDP growth. The paper draws important policy implications for theory, research and practice. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."
1273,"Identifying and evaluating poverty using multisource remote sensing and point of interest (POI) data: A case study of Chongqing, China","Shi, Kaifang; Chang, Zhijian; Chen, Zuoqi; Wu, Jianping; Yu, Bailang","Poverty is a chronic worldwide dilemma that can seriously hamper human sustainable development, which is closely related to economic growth, environmental protection, ecological restoration, and sustainable utilization of resources. Accurately and effectively identifying and evaluating poverty has become an important prerequisite for allowing Chinese governments to make reasonable poverty reduction and alleviation policies. Thus, using Chongqing as a study area, the purpose of this study was to analyze poverty from multiple viewpoints based on multiple data sources. First, a comprehensive poverty index (CPI) was developed by combining nighttime light data, the digital elevation model (DEM), the normalized differential vegetation index (NDVI), and point of interest (POI) data to map poverty at a 500-m spatial resolution. Then, the performance of the CPI was validated with poverty-stricken villages, Google Earth images, and the multidimensional poverty index (MPI). Finally, spatial autocorrelation analysis was used to explore the spatial distribution of poverty across county and town levels. The results revealed that the CPI could provide an effective way of identifying the spatial distribution of poverty when compared with three validated indexes. Most of the rich counties were in the center of Chongqing, whereas the poor counties were located in the northeast and southeast of Chongqing. The Global Moran's I index showed that there were significantly positive spatial autocorrelations of poverty, and that the spatial autocorrelation of poverty was more significant at the town level compared to the county level. Among the selected factors, the POI cost distance was the most import factor for assessing poverty. Our study will be valuable for providing scientific references for the government to implement precise poverty alleviation methods with differentiated policies in China. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Allogenic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is the only curative therapy for CAEBV, but relapse sometimes occurs. Relapse is generally attributed to proliferation of recipient-derived CAEBV cells. We herein report a case of donor-derived CAEBV-like NK-cell post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease (PTLD) in a 41-year-old female after the first allogenic HSCT for CAEBV from an HLA-matched sibling donor. A second HSCT from an HLA-matched unrelated donor successfully controlled the disease, but EBV infection of cells derived from the second donor continued to be detected. Although the mechanisms underlying CAEBV and CAEBV-like NK-cell PTLD have not yet been elucidated in detail, the findings of the present case imply that host genetic factors, including familial factors, may be important in disease development."

Melatonin (MLT) can mitigate the reproductive damage caused by certain chemotherapy drugs. In this study, we aimed to identify impact of PTX on the main biological processes and protective effect of MLT on reproductive damage caused by PTX. Mice exposed to PTX mainly impaired spermatogenesis, such as decreased sperm counts, reduced sperm motility and increased abnormal sperm. Decreased expressions of germ cell proliferation-associated protein PCNA and meiosis-related protein SYCP3 induced by PTX were determined by Western blot, while MLT ameliorated this effect and increased the expressions of PCNA, SYCP3, DMC1, STRA8 and fertility-related protein of HSPA2, resulting in significantly improved spermatogenesis and sperm quality levels. In vitro fertilization experiment showed that PTX significantly decreased blastocyst formation rates, which can be improved by MLT administration, but not two-cell development rates. Taken together, this work demonstrated PTX can adversely affect germ cell proliferation and meiosis, which ultimately influence sperm quality and male fertility, and highlighted the protective ability of MLT on ameliorating the side effects of PTX, especially on sperm quality. The results provide information to further the study on the molecular mechanism of PTX's effects on male reproduction and the protective mechanism of MLT."

Understanding the role of energy structural adjustment in achieving such targets is critical along with China's rapid urbanization process. This study aims to uncover the drivers of China's non-fossil energy development during 1990-2016, and conduct scenarios and probability analyses of different energy consumption and CO2 emission trajectories until 2050. Results show that economic scale plays a key role with urbanization identified as an essential factor in driving non-fossil energy development. The consumption of fossil fuels will continue to increase with rapid urbanization, leading to higher CO2 emissions. China will only achieve the 2030 targets if energy structural adjustment is completed on schedule. Under the current policies, CO2 emissions may peak between 2030 and 2032, while CO2 intensity will decrease. Such findings provide valuable insights and suggest that China should achieve low carbon transition through energy structural adjustment, while taking urbanization as an opportunity."

The virus is of one serotype but has diverse genotypes infecting both humans and animals. Based on evidence from seroprevalence studies, about 2 billion people are estimated to have been infected with HEV globally. HEV, therefore, poses a significant public health and economic challenge worldwide. HEV was discovered in the 1980s and was traced back to the 1955 - 1956 outbreak of hepatitis that occurred in India. Subsequently, several HEV epidemics involving thousands of individuals have occurred nearly annually in different countries in Asia and Africa. Initially, the virus was thought to be only enterically transmitted, and endemic in developing countries. Due to the environmental hygiene and sanitation challenges in those parts of the world. However, recent studies have suggested otherwise with the report of autochthonous cases in industrialised countries with no history of travel to the so-called endemic countries. Thus, suggesting that HEV has a global distribution with endemicity in both developing and industrialised nations. Studies have also revealed that HEV has multiple risk factors, and modes of transmission as well as zoonotic potentials. Additionally, recent findings have shown that HEV leads to severe disease, particularly among pregnant women. In contrast to the previous narration of a strictly mild and self-limiting infection. Studies have likewise demonstrated chronic HEV infection among immunocompromised persons. Consequent to these recent discoveries, this pathogen is considered a re - emerging virus, particularly in the developed nations. However, despite the growing public health challenges of this pathogen, the burden is still underestimated. The underestimation is often attributed to poor awareness among clinicians and a lack of routine checks for the disease in the hospitals. Thus, leading to misdiagnosis and underdiagnosis. Hence, this review provides a concise overview of epidemiology, diagnosis, and prevention of hepatitis E."
1280,Ecological security assessment of the Guanzhong Plain urban agglomeration based on an adapted ecological footprint model,"Yang, Yi; Cai, Zixuan","The acceleration of urbanization and industrialization has led to new ecological security (ES) risks for urban agglomerations in developing countries. The level of ES with the goal of improving adaptive capacity is becoming the basis for space demand regulation and coordinated development of ecological economy. In relation to the actual socio-economic development of the Guanzhong Plain urban agglomeration (GPUA), three sub-accounts covering domestic water, production water and eco-environment water were added to the adapted ecological footprint model to reflect the underestimated water demand in the GPUA. Based on an analysis of the per capita ecological deficit and the dynamic changes in each account in the GPUA from 2005 to 2017, the ecological pressure index and eco-economic coordination index were used to evaluate the ES level of GPUA, and the footprint depth and footprint size were used to evaluate trends in the state of ES. The results show that (1) the GPUA water resource account is the second largest contribution account to the ecological footprint; (2) the GPUA has been at the 6(th) ES level, ""completely unsafe"", since 2005; and (3) based on the three-dimensional ecological footprint, the GPUA needs 4.76 times current area to meet its resource consumption level, indicating that ecological insecurity levels will not improve. Therefore, improving the water resources management system, controlling the sources of atmospheric pollution, and strengthening the zoning of functional lands are recommended. Quantitatively analysing the relationships among the ES level, various resources environmental and economic activities provides a scientific basis for improving the resilience level of urban agglomerations in response to ecological changes.

1281,Identification of medicinal compounds as potential inhibitors for mutated isocitrate dehydrogenases against chondrosarcoma,"Fahad Hassan Shah,Song Ja Kim,Fahad Hassan Shah,Song Ja Kim","Chondrosarcoma is the third most common cartilaginous bone tumour that is insusceptible to radio- and chemotherapy and it is inclined to metastasis. These resistant qualities are facilitated by mutant variants of isocitrate dehydrogenases (IDH) 1-2 enzyme. These mutant enzymes promote oncogenesis of chondrocytes by changing their epigenetic wardrobe leading to tumour formation. Presently, there are lack of drugs available to be exploited as a remedy for this disease. On the other hand, majority of chemotherapeutic drugs induce cytotoxicity in the cancer cells at the cost of harming surrounding healthy cells, jeopardizing human life. The current study is focused on screening various medicinal compounds against IDH1 and IDH2 combined with insilico gene expression, cancer cells cytotoxicity and ADMET (absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion and toxicity) studies to elucidate the molecular mechanism against chondrosarcoma and also to uncover pharmacokinetic profile of these compounds. Screening of 5000+ compounds filtered two efficacious compounds (Artocarpetin and 5-Galloylquinic acid) capable of establishing hydrogen bond connections with both IDH variants. Other studies showed that these compounds downregulate ITGAV, CARPIN1, CCL5 and COG5 and TNFRSF10B gene that reduces chondrogenesis and inflammation, Artocarpetin and 5-galloylquinic acid are TP53 expression enhancer and inhibit MM9 expression that promote immunomodulation and apoptosis in these cancers. These compounds are both active against CHSA8926 and CHSA011 cell line of chondrosarcoma. However, the ADME profile of 5-galloylquinic acid is slightly unsatisfactory based on druglikness and bioavailability score criteria as compared to artocarpetin. Both of these compounds are class-5 chemicals and require high doses to elicit adverse response. Our results suggest that artocarpetin and 5-galloylquinic acid are efficacious drug candidates and could be further exploited to validate these findings in vitro."

Different fluids (distilled water ""DW"", GNP-SDBS/DW, Al2O3/DW, and SiO2/DW) and tube geometries (rectangular, triangular, trapezoidal, and curved ribs) are investigated using a carefully validated computational fluids dynamics (CFD) model. Compared to DW flow in a smooth tube, the maximum overall performance improvement (similar to 37 %) was found in the case of GNP-SDBS/DW nanofluid flow in a curvedly ribbed tube at Re of 10,000. For all fluids and tube geometries, the overall performance enhancement was found to decrease at Reynolds numbers higher than 10,000. Curvedly ribbed tubes have better performances at medium and high flow rates, regardless of the fluid type. However, at low flow rates or when the pumping power consumption is not a major concern, trapezoidal ribs can be used to achieve higher heat transfer rates. Overall, using corrugated tubes (maximum performance improvement of similar to 20 %) was found a more energy-efficient technique than using nanofluids (up to similar to 11 %). Combining both techniques achieves enhances the performance by up to similar to 37 %. These findings can be used as a guide for determining the most suitable technique based on an overall techno-economic evaluation."

In last few decades, the populations of M. dubia has rapidly expanded in the Indian sub-continents, leading to an increase in the genetic diversity of species. However, very less information is available on intra-specific variation in Melia under the Indian subcontinent. Therefore, a present investigation was undertaken, to assess the level of diversity in seed and saplings of the Melia populations (ecotypes) collected from three agro-ecological regions of India. Results revealed that the seed and saplings of all the ecotypes are significantly different for all the traits, except for number of branches per plant, and the maximum variability was recorded in germination percentage, seed weight, internodal length, and sapling height of the species. The high heritability for seed weight (0.99), length (0.99), and width (0.97), and germination percentage (0.99) indicated that selection and genetic gain for these traits would be effective during the commencement of improvement program. Trait association analysis explained that higher seed weight significantly reduced sapling height, collar diameter, number of leaves per plant, internodal length, petiole length, and germination percentage (r = -0.86; p < 0.001) that ultimately reduced the seedling vigor in Melia dubia. Interestingly, the number of branches per plant were not associated with any of the morphological traits. The first principal component explained 50.09% of the entire variation and all the traits contributed greatly to the variation for this principal component, except for number of branches, leaf width and seed length. The clustering approach assorted geographic variation of M. dubia populations into three main sub-clusters i.e. South, North, and North East populations each consisting of five, seven and one populations (including cultivar), respectively. Among different ecotypes, Bahumukhi, Varsha and US Nagar seed sources outperformed all others in seedling vigour (sapling height) and rest of the growth parameters. Overall, findings explained that considerable scope exists for the development of superior planting material of M. dubia through exploration of seeds and selection at the early seedling stage."
1284,Optimization of reduced chemical fertilizer use in tea gardens based on the assessment of related environmental and economic benefits,"Wang, Ziteng; Geng, Yuanbo; Liang, Tao","Chemical fertilizer application is the primary method used to maintain tea yield and quality, but has a negative environmental impact owing to its excessive use. This study sought to assess the environmental and economic benefits of three different chemical fertilizer reduction modes: Single reduction of chemical fertilizer (SRCF), combined application of organic and chemical fertilizer (CAOF), and controlled-release fertilizer substitute (CRFS). Differences in soil nutrient content, NP (NH4+-N, NO3-N and total P) runoff loss, tea yield and quality, and the revenue of tea planting across different fertilizer reduction treatments were then discussed. We also analyzed the coupling effects of these different fertilization modes, fertilization rate and time on soil NP runoff loss, which allowed us to determine the optimum fertilization method based on differences in their respective environmental and economic benefits. Our results revealed differences in soil nutrient content, tea yield and quality, NP runoff loss, and revenue owing to tea planting across the different fertilization treatments. Soil pH after fertilization was significantly lower than before fertilization. CAOF was beneficial and improved soil nutrients as well as tea yield and quality. Of the tested methods, 50% combined application of organic and chemical fertilizer (CAOF2) was the best, as it resulted in the best tea quality and yield. CAOF2 also had the highest revenue. In addition, it was beneficial in reducing NP runoff loss. CRFS was advantageous in its persistent fertilizer efficiency and reduction in NP runoff loss. With CAOF, NP runoff loss was primarily caused by quick-acting chemical fertilizer. With extended time, NP runoff loss caused by fertilization was gradually decreased. Given our analysis of the environmental and economic benefits of different fertilizer reduction methods, CAOF2 emerged in this study as the best fertilizer reduction treatment option.

1285,Sustainable supplier selection under must-be criteria through Fuzzy inference system,"Jain, Naveen; Singh, A. R.","Growing awareness about the environmental and social issues and pressure from all stakeholders has forced industries to adopt sustainability practices in their supply chains. Suppliers contribute significantly to establishing an effective sustainable supply chain. Hence industries need to evaluate its potential suppliers precisely on sustainability criteria. In this work, a two-phase decision model using Fuzzy Interference System (FIS) along with Fuzzy Kano philosophy for the sustainable environment has been proposed to select sustainable suppliers for a large scale industry. In the first phase, sustainability criteria clustering using fuzzy Kano model has been performed for the identification of 'Must-be' criteria in economic, environmental and social dimensions. Further, sub-criteria with quantified evaluation levels for Must-be criteria have been established. In the second phase, the three distinct Fuzzy Inference System (FIS) has been developed for evaluating the Sustainability Performance Index (SPI) values of each supplier in three sustainability dimensions. In FIS, the architecture of each model is modified in such a way that each FIS engine have to compute the minimum number of rules. Finally, weights are assigned to SPI in each dimension, and suppliers are ranked for final selection. Sensitivity analysis has been performed to demonstrate the robustness of the proposed decision framework. A sustainable supplier selection problem of the iron and steel industry of India has been investigated to show the effectiveness and applicability of the proposed decision framework.

Ensuring a safe and reliable water supply and maintaining water sanitation has become ever more critical during the pandemic. For this reason, researchers and practitioners have promptly investigated the impact associated with the spread of SARS-CoV-2 on water treatment processes, focusing specifically on water disinfection. However, the COVID-19 pandemic impacts multiple aspects of the urban water sector besides those related to the engineering processes, including sanitary, economic, and social consequences which can have significant effects in the near future. Furthermore, this outbreak appears at a time when the water sector was already experiencing a fourth revolution, transitioning toward the digitalisation of the sector, which redefines the Water-Human-Data Nexus. In this contribution, a product of collaboration between academics and practitioners from water utilities, we delve into the multiple impacts that the pandemic is currently causing and their possible consequences in the future. We show how the digitalisation of the water sector can provide useful approaches and tools to help address the impact of the pandemic. We expect this discussion to contribute not only to current challenges, but also to the conceptualization of new projects and the broader task of ameliorating dimate change. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

1287,Assessment of wind-induced nonlinear post-critical performance of bridge decks,"Zhang, Mingjie; Xu, Fuyou; Han, Yan","A quantitative analysis of the wind-induced post-critical performance of bridge decks is presented in order to highlight the underlying wind-resistant capacity after the critical wind speeds. Two simple indices, i.e., the wind speed extension (after the critical state) with acceptable post-critical vibrations and the relative post-critical capacity (i.e., the ratio between the aforementioned wind speed extension and the critical speed value), are utilized to quantify the post-critical performance of bridge decks. A short review on available limit states of vibration in literatures and design codes is presented in order to define a suitable threshold for acceptable post-critical vibrations. The post-critical performances of three typical cross-sections are quantitatively analyzed with the proposed indices, in which the limit states of vibration are reasonable defined considering either structural normal operation or structural safety. The effects of various mechanical and aerodynamic properties (e.g., mechanical damping ratio, natural frequency, initial angle of attack, and aerodynamic derivatives) on the post-critical behaviors of the selected cross-sections are highlighted. The quantitative analysis of the post-critical performance in the present work may deepen the understanding of the wind-resistant performance of bridges and potentially serve as a building block for a more economic wind-resistant design framework for future long-span bridges."

Meanwhile, the corresponding layered double oxides (CoxCuy-LDOs) were prepared as controls. In this study, Electrical energy per order was performed to evaluate economic analysis. Correspondingly, we found that CoxCuy-LDHs possessed a significantly better PMS activation capability than the corresponding metal oxide composite (Co3O4/CuO). Compared with other Co(x)Cu(y)LDHs, Co2Cu1 LDH possessed the best PMS activation capability for LOM degradation and the lowest electrical energy per order (EE/O) value during the reaction. Additionally, Co2Cu1 LDH presented an excellent stability and worked over a wide pH range. The hydroxide states of Co(III), Co(II), Cu(I) and Cu(II) were all able to activate PMS, indicating that there were many active sites on the surface of Co2Cu1 LDH. The involvement of radicals in this reaction system was determined via scavenger experiments and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR). Meanwhile, it's worth noting that a mathematical model was developed to quantify the involvement of SO4 center dot- and center dot OH. Subsequently, we determined PMS activation mechanism and LOM decomposition pathway for the PMS/Co2Cu1 LDH system."

However, many of the potential applications of large-scale battery systems are not economically viable at this point in time. As a result, several BESS projects are being pushed by the industry towards specific niches which are based on revenue streams that can be rather complex than straightforward. The aim of this paper is to provide an overview of how large-scale Li-ion BESS are currently being implemented in the EMEA region, giving an answer to the following questions: what are the main use-cases of large-scale Li-ion batteries that are being implemented? What are the key factors that are enabling the deployment of BESS projects in the present markets? How can current tendencies be extrapolated to the future outlook of Li-ion BESS implementations? The large-scale energy storage market is evolving at a very fast pace, hence this review paper intends to contribute to a better understanding of the current status of Li-ion battery systems focusing on the economic feasibility that is driving the realization of Li-ion BESS projects in the EMEA region."
1290,On the snow leopard Trails: Occupancy pattern and implications for management in the Pamir,"Jaffar Ud Din,Shoaib Hameed,Hussain Ali,Yusoff Norma-Rashid,Durriyyah Sharifah Hasan Adli,Muhammad Ali Nawaz,Jaffar Ud Din,Shoaib Hameed,Hussain Ali,Yusoff Norma-Rashid,Durriyyah Sharifah Hasan Adli,Muhammad Ali Nawaz","The snow leopard (Panthera uncia) inhabits one of the most challenging environments on Earth, referred to as the 'third pole'. Only a fraction of its vast range has been explored thus far, owing to myriad of barriers inflicted by the remote terrain and socio-ecological realities of the landscapes. Understanding distribution patterns of species is essential to devise practical management measures. This study aimed to understand the distribution pattern and factors influencing occupancy of snow leopard in the Pamir Mountain range through sign-based occupancy modelling. Our study confirmed that the Pamir range is a snow leopard stronghold, with occupancy estimated at 0.57 ± 0.02. The topographic features positively influenced the detection probability (p = 0.37 ± 0.005) of snow leopards. Occupancy was influenced by mean annual precipitation (β = -6.12 ± 1.8), density of roads (β = -1.61 ± 0.6) and water sources (β = 0.74 ± 0.4). Our findings underpin that sign-based distribution surveys provide vigorous scientific knowledge about elusive species and merit replication being used for other species. We propose to redefine the protected area boundaries based on ecological knowledge and encourage transboundary cooperation to safeguard snow leopards at a landscape scale."

Due to specific characteristics of grey wastewater, treatment and recycling of this type of wastewater capture global attention. This paper presents a literature review of the remediation of greywater by adsorption processes. Besides, the reclamation of the grey wastewater in the context of the circular economy is highlighted. In this regard, the characterization of various types of grey wastewater, the potential risks associated with greywater, and the properties of reclaimed water as per the regulation or guideline are summarized. These standards vary based on the application of reused water and from a country to another country. Furthermore, this review elucidates the adsorption process in terms of the type of adsorbents, modification of adsorbents and their regeneration process, adsorption isotherm, kinetics and thermodynamic of adsorption, and optimization of adsorption system. Finally, the removal of different pollutants from greywater by various adsorbents and techno-economic aspects are illustrated."
1292,Prehospital Surgical Airway Management: An NAEMSP Position Statement and Resource Document,"Robert F Reardon,Aaron E Robinson,Rebecca Kornas,Jeffrey D Ho,Brendan Anzalone,Jestin Carlson,Michael Levy,Brian Driver,Robert F Reardon,Aaron E Robinson,Rebecca Kornas,Jeffrey D Ho,Brendan Anzalone,Jestin Carlson,Michael Levy,Brian Driver","Bag-valve-mask ventilation and endotracheal intubation have been the mainstay of prehospital airway management for over four decades. Recently, supraglottic device use has risen due to various factors. The combination of bag-valve-mask ventilation, endotracheal intubation, and supraglottic devices allows for successful airway management in a majority of patients. However, there exists a small portion of patients who are unable to be intubated and cannot be adequately ventilated with either a facemask or a supraglottic airway. These patients require an emergent surgical airway. A surgical airway is an important component of all airway algorithms, and in some cases may be the only viable approach; therefore, it is imperative that EMS agencies that are credentialed to manage airways have the capability to perform surgical airways when appropriate. The National Association of Emergency Medical Services Physicians (NAEMSP) recommends the following for emergency medical services (EMS) agencies that provide advanced airway management.A surgical airway is reasonable in the prehospital setting when the airway cannot be secured by less invasive means.When indicated, a surgical airway should be performed without delay.A surgical airway is not a substitute for other airway management tools and techniques. It should not be the only rescue option available.Success of an open surgical approach using a scalpel is higher than that of percutaneous Seldinger techniques or needle-jet ventilation in the emergency setting."

However, there is a limited understanding of the underlying pathophysiology of VCI, especially in relation to CCH. Neuroinflammation is a significant contributor in the progression of VCI as increased systemic levels of the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin-1β (IL-1β) has been extensively reported in VCI patients. Recently it has been established that CCH can activate the inflammasome signaling pathways, involving NLRP3 and AIM2 inflammasomes that critically regulate IL-1β production. Given that neuroinflammation is an early event in VCI, it is important that we understand its molecular and cellular mechanisms to enable development of disease-modifying treatments to reduce the structural brain damage and cognitive deficits that are observed clinically in the elderly. Hence, this review aims to provide a comprehensive insight into the molecular and cellular mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of CCH-induced inflammasome signaling in VCI."
1294,Utilization of biochar produced from invasive plant species to efficiently adsorb Cd (II) and Pb (II),"Lian, Wanli; Yang, Li; Joseph, Stephen; Shi, Wei; Bian, Rongjun; Zheng, Jufeng; Li, Lianqing; Shan, Shengdao; Pan, Genxing","Global expansion of invasive plant species has caused serious ecological and economic problems. Two such invasive species, ragweed and horseweed, were pyrolyzed at temperatures of 350, 450 and 550 degrees C for biochar production (RB350, RB450, RB550 and HB350, HB450, HB550). The biochars produced were used for Cd(II) and Pb(II) removal in aqueous solutions. The results indicated that the properties of the biochars varied with pyrolysis temperature, which further affected their adsorption performance. The maximum adsorption capacity of RB450 for Cd(II) (139 mg.g(-1)) and Pb(II) (358.7 mg.g(-1)) was much higher than that shown in previous studies. The immobilized Cd(II) and Pb(II) fraction on RB450, RB550, HB450 and HB550 was mainly attributable to the acid soluble and non-available fractions. These findings suggested that pyrolysis of invasive plants at 450 degrees C could not only be an option to control invasive plants but also could be of benefit in using biochar as excellent adsorbent."

Drug shortages not only worsen patient outcomes, but also significantly burden healthcare systems with additional costs. This study aimed to assess community pharmacy staff knowledge, opinion, and practice toward drug shortages in Saudi Arabia from November 2019 to March 2020. This was a cross-sectional study carried out among 1,008 community pharmacists from Saudi Arabia using a validated, self-administered and Internet-based survey. Analysis was done using chi square and fisher exact tests. Most participants were males (97.2%), less than 30 years old (48.1%), and non-Saudi citizens (94.4%), and 72.0% had good knowledge of drug shortages (score = 4-5). Around 36.0% reported that it takes 1-3 days to receive a response to the shortage report. There was a statistically significant association between the professional level of the community pharmacists and their opinion about reporting drug shortages (P < .05). Most community pharmacies (56.2%) did not receive any notification about drug shortages. In conclusion, most community pharmacists are knowledgeable and have good practice regarding drug shortages, but their opinions about drug shortages differ according to each pharmacy reporting policy."

The single crystal X-ray structural analysis of B1 suggests that the disubstituted benzimidazole compound crystallizes in a monoclinic system and the indole groups exist in a perpendicular fashion with respect to benzimidazole moiety. The SARS-CoV-2 screening activity has been studied against 1 × 10e4 VeroE6 cells in a dose-dependent manner following Hoechst 33342 and nucleocapsid staining activity with respect to remdesivir. The compound exhibits 92.4% cell viability for 30 h and 35.1% inhibition against VeroE6 cells at non-cytotoxic concentration. Molecular docking studies predict high binding propensities of B1 with the main protease (Mpro) and non-structural (nsp2 and nsp7-nsp8) proteins of SARS-CoV-2 through a number of non-covalent interactions. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation analysis for 100 ns confirms the formation of stable conformations of B1-docked proteins with significant changes of binding energy, attributing the potential inhibition properties of the synthetic benzimidazole scaffold against SARS-CoV-2.

This model has been applied for several decades in even-aged, clearcutting (CC) systems but less so in uneven-aged, continuous-cover forestry (CCF). We provide an overview of retention in CCF in temperate regions of Europe, currently largely focused on habitat trees and dead wood. The relevance of current meta-analyses and many other studies on retention in CC is limited since they emphasize larger patches in open surroundings. Therefore, we reflect here on the ecological foundations and socio-economic frameworks of retention approaches in CCF, and highlight several areas with development potential for the future. Conclusions from this perspective paper, based on both research and current practice on several continents, although highlighting Europe, are also relevant to other temperate regions of the world using continuous-cover forest management approaches."

The records of patients who underwent the modified Harada-Ito procedure by the same surgeon during 2012-2019 were retrospectively reviewed regarding pre- and post-operative data and individual dose-scale used for the surgery. The modified Harada-Ito procedure involved advancing the anterior half of the superior oblique tendon toward the inferior edge of the lateral rectus muscle by a distance determined using a five-graded scale. A total of 27 patients (mean age 57.6 years, range, 22-81 years; 10 female) were included. Evaluating surgical outcome showed a significant difference in pre- to post-operative cyclodeviation (p = <0.001). Pre-operative mean extorsion was -10.4° and mean torsional correction achieved was 7.7°. The dose-effect relationship showed a wide spread effect, yet yielded a high success rate. All but two patients were symptom free from their torsional diplopia at the last post-operative evaluation, on average 24 months after surgery. Post-operative results and the dose-effect of the modified Harada-Ito corresponded with the aimed-for correction of torsional diplopia.. Fusion evaluation and individually based pre-operative assessments proved essential in determining individual doses for successful surgical outcomes."
1300,The role of the focal company in sustainable development goals: A Brazilian food poultry supply chain case study,"Pohlmann, Christopher Rosa; Scavarda, Annibal Jose; Alves, Murilo Barros; Korzenowski, Andre Luis","Food supply chains face challenges of sustainable supply chain management, such as waste management and environmental issues. Vertical integration or system integration is a corporate strategy for chicken production managed by the focal company. This research study discusses the role of the focal company for achieving sustainable development goals (SDGs) in a Brazilian food poultry supply chain. The research consisted of a single case study with the following steps: literature review, identification of the gaps, concepts synthesis, and case study. The findings indicated theoretical and empirical guidelines for SDGs. The literature review indicated the relevance of exploring some approaches to achieve sustainable supply chain management: corporate social responsibility, green supply chain management, industrial ecology, stakeholder theory, circular economy (reduce, reuse, and recycle with economic prosperity), and sustainability science. The focal company plays a strategic role in the vertical integration operation of the Brazilian poultry supply chain. The case study findings indicate the role of the focal company toward the actors, including the feed mill supplier, live poultry transport, poultry processor, rendering plant, and distributor. However, much remains to be accomplished to answer the question ""how to be sustainable?"", especially in environmental and social issues involving all actors in the poultry supply chain. The Brazilian environmental legislation still needs to be revised to be aligned with SDGs because the legislation will not guarantee sustainable management and efficient use of natural resources. The critical issues and challenges are radical changes in business models, measurement of supply chain impacts, collaboration and network picturing, corporate social responsibility versus supply chain responsibility, stakeholder engagement, frameworks to implement SDGs, education about SDGs and public participation, and food supply chain integrated system forums.

In the past three decades, there is a revived research interest in the therapeutic potential of psychedelic drugs with expected FDA approvals for treatment of various conditions. Given the exponential scientific growth of this field, we sought to characterize, analyze, and visualize trends in its top-cited articles. Bibliometric analyses are quantitative approaches to characterize a scientific field, including evaluation of the impact of academic literature. The bibliometric analysis and visualizations were conducted with R-tools for comprehensive science mapping. The top-cited 100 articles were cited between 82 and 668 times (median 125; mean 158). Fifty-four percent of the T100 articles were produced in the past decade (2010-2020). Network and author impact analysis highlighted key figures and primary collaboration networks within the top 100 publications. UK, USA, Switzerland, Spain, and Brazil lead the field. Results are discussed in terms of research growth, access, diversity, and the distribution of knowledge and experience in the field.

1302,Child Maltreatment and Substance Use: A Behavior Genetic Analysis,"Andia M Azimi,Eric J Connolly,Andia M Azimi,Eric J Connolly","Child maltreatment is a pervasive social problem often perpetuated by family members and is related to a wide array of negative life outcomes. Although substance use is an outcome commonly associated with experiences of child maltreatment, not all individuals who experience maltreatment struggle with such issues. Many individuals can positively adapt to experiences of maltreatment based on levels of resilience and susceptibility. Research suggests that genetic differences may partly explain why negative outcomes develop for some, but not for others. Few studies have examined the extent to which genetic and environmental factors influence the longitudinal association between child maltreatment and varying forms of substance use, leaving a fundamental gap in our current understanding of this association. The current study aims to address this gap by analyzing a sample of twins from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (Add Health). Findings from a series of univariate and bivariate biometric models reveal that the longitudinal associations between maltreatment, cigarette use, and marijuana use are accounted for by additive genetic and nonshared environmental factors. Moreover, the magnitude of the contribution varies across unique subgroups of cigarette and marijuana use. Directions for future research and theoretical implications are discussed."
1303,Temporal dynamics and spatial differences of household carbon emissions per capita of China's provinces during 2000-2019,"Ce Song,Tao Zhao,Yange Xiao,Ce Song,Tao Zhao,Yange Xiao","To assess the characteristics of household carbon emissions per capita (HCPC), this paper divided China's provinces into 4 groups based on the decoupling relationship between household consumption and related emissions. This classification helped to analyze the correlation and reflected the decoupling status between carbon emissions and household consumption and explored the effect of consumption growth on carbon emissions. Then, according to logarithmic mean divisia index (LMDI) model, HCPC in China's provinces was decomposed into four drivers including carbon coefficient, energy structure, energy consumption, and population structure effect. Through multi-regional (M-R) analysis, temporal evolution and spatial differences of these four drivers in both national and provincial level were studied. This comparison method introduced temporal and spatial decomposition results into the same framework, which may provide a new perspective for analyzing carbon emission trends. The results showed that (a) the HCPC in all 30 provinces increased significantly especially in Inner Mongolia, Tianjin, Xinjiang, Heilongjiang, and Beijing. Energy consumption effect was the leading factor promoting HCPC growth. Energy structure and population structure also promoted HCPC growth slightly, and carbon coefficient was the effect which had inhibitory effect on HCPC growth at regional level. (b) Spatial differences of HCPC between regions narrowed during this period. This is mainly due to the rapid growth of HCPC in region IV. Energy consumption effect was the dominant factor for the spatial differences. Based on the results, this paper proposed to adopt more effective measures to improve energy efficiency, develop clean energy, and optimize energy structure, especially in the provinces with faster growth in carbon emissions."

Water resources depletion has become a significant problem in this region that is likely to worsen. Current research by remote sensing analysis indicates a descending trend of water storage in the Middle East region, where agriculture plays a crucial role in socio-economic life. This study introduces an approach quantifying water depletion in the Middle Eastern countries, which are being challenged in the management of their water resources. Furthermore, this paper presents results of a survey assessing the status of water use and supply in Middle Eastern countries and outlines some potential remedies. Specifically, Iran's water use is evaluated and compared with its neighbors'. The water equivalent anomaly (WEA) and total water storage (TWS) depletion are two indexes of water scarcity calculated for Middle Eastern countries surveyed herein. Our analysis reveals that Lebanon, Syria, Iraq, and Iran are countries with very negative water scarcity indexes. These estimates prove that international cooperation is needed to manage available regional water resources and reverse depletion of natural water sources. It is demonstrated herein that virtual water trade can help remediate regional water shortage in Middle Eastern countries."
1305,Integrated assessment of sulfate-based AOPs for pharmaceutical active compound removal from wastewater,"Sbardella, Luca; Velo Gala, Inmaculada; Comas, Joaquim; Morera Carbonell, Serni; Rodriguez-Roda, Ignasi; Gernjak, Wolfgang","Advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) have been proposed as tertiary treatments for municipal WWTP effluents. UV-activated peroxydisulfate (PDS) and peroxymonosulfate (PMS) are viable technological alternatives for treating secondary WWTP effluent containing PhACs. This article examines the feasibility of applying UV/PDS and UV/PMS technologies at pilot scale, assessing their energy and cost requirements. In addition, life cycle assessment (LCA) impacts associated with the treatment of 1 m(3) of wastewater with an effective average pharmaceutical active compounds (PhACs) removal of 80% has also been evaluated. Photolysis (UV) treatment alone was not capable of degrading PhACs to a sufficient extent in WWTP secondary effluent. The addition of 0.4 mmol of PDS or PMS, applying 416 mJ/cm(2 )of UV fluence, resulted in average removals of 84% and 85% for UV/PDS and UV/PMS, respectively. The electrical energy (kWh) required to degrade the mix of PhACs by one order of magnitude in 1 m(3) of contaminated water was calculated as 0.9 kWh/m(3)/order and 0.8 kWh/m(3)/order 4 for UV/PDS and UV/PMS, respectively. However, the overall cost, including operation, materials and maintenance, of applying UV/PDS and UV/PMS, based on an average PhAC removal of 80%, was 0.088 (sic)/m(3) and 0.280 (sic)/m(3), respectively. From the sustainability assessment, the factors with the greatest environmental footprint for the UV/PDS process were chemical production (PDS: 52.9%, PMS: 85%) and electricity consumption (UV/PDS: 33.4%, UV/PMS: 11.2). Finally, the normalized environmental impact analysis showed that UV/PDS was associated with an environmental footprint three times lower than UV/PMS. The overall assessment revealed that UV/PDS is preferable to UV/PMS to remove PhACs in secondary effluents of municipal WWTPs having a lower economic and environmental impact. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Thus, a cascade ASHP for high-temperature water (such as 75 degrees C) at low ambient temperature (-20 degrees C) is developed. To exam its feasibility and study its energy performance under various hot water temperature, an experiment is carried out within hot water supply temperature from 55 to 75 degrees C and at ambient temperature as low as -21 degrees C. The results show that the cascade heat pump has excellent energy efficient at low ambient temperature and high water-supply temperature and proves the thermodynamic feasibility of the unit to supply high-temperature water for residential heating and industry use. In addition, cascade ASHP and other clean hot water technologies are compared from an economic and environmental perspective. The total economic cost of the cascade heat pump is the lowest, while the carbon dioxide cascade heat pumps is higher than gas boiler. In general, the studied heat pump reveals good energy, economic performance and acceptable environmental performance, proving its feasibility. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."

Psychometric and logometric principles were used to develop an assessment questionnaire capable of evaluating the communication state domains important to patients with neurological disorders. The hypothesized domains were to include (1) auditory function, (2) speech function (3) cognitive functions (4) sensorimotor function, and (5) activities of daily living (ADL). An initial pool of 78 questions was pilot-tested for clarity in 10 patients; following factor analysis, the number of questions was reduced to 39-items. Then the questionnaire was subjected to reliability and validity testing. Factor analysis supported the 5 hypothesized domains. Test-retest reliability using Spearman's correlation demonstrated substantial agreement, ranging from 0.72 for the ADL domain to 0.92 for the auditory function domain. In testing for internal consistency, Cronbach's alphas ranged from 0.86 for-the ADL domain to 0.96 for the cognitive function domain. Correlation between domains gave evidence of construct validity. In comparing similar domains in the AAC questionnaire, a moderate correlation (range 0.33-0.83) for the ADL and sensorimotor function scales were found. The correlation was more positive between the other domains. Testing of reliability for the phraseological, syntactic and semantic competence indices showed good positive correlation between initial and retest scores. The questions in the AAC questionnaire have undergone rigorous psychometric and logometric testing, and the tool is an appropriate instrument for the assessment of neurological patients with communication deficit. The psycholinguistic assessment provides with the main weight of data for successful communication therapy."
1308,Experimental assessment of cycling ageing of lithium-ion second-life batteries from electric vehicles,"Braco, Elisa; San Martin, Idoia; Berrueta, Alberto; Sanchis, Pablo; Ursua, Alfredo","The reutilization of batteries from electric vehicles allows to benefit from their remaining energy capacity and to increase their lifespan. The applications considered for the second life of these batteries are less demanding than electric vehicles regarding power and energy density. However, there is still some uncertainty regarding the technical and economic viability of these systems. In this context, the study of the ageing and lifetime of reused batteries is key to contribute to their development. This paper assesses the experimental cycle ageing of lithiumion modules from different Nissan Leaf through accelerated cycling tests on their second life. The evolution of the internal parameters during ageing and the correlation between them are shown, including the analysis of best fitting curves. In addition, a second-life end-of-life criterion is proposed, based on capacity and internal resistance measurements during cells ageing, which can be applied to real application in order to prevent safety issues. By estimating future values from degradation trends and checking latter measurements, the ageing knee is identified. Results show that the modules operate for at least 2033 equivalent full cycles before reaching their ageing knee. This would mean more than 5 years of operation in a real second-life application, such as a photovoltaic self-consumption installation with daily cycling. Moreover, it is shown that a traditional cell characterisation based on capacity and internal resistance measurements is not enough to predict the durability of a cell during its second life."
1309,Extracting Nonlinear Dynamics from Psychological and Behavioral Time Series Through HAVOK Analysis,"Robert G Moulder,Elena Martynova,Steven M Boker,Robert G Moulder,Elena Martynova,Steven M Boker","Analytical methods derived from nonlinear dynamical systems, complexity, and chaos theories offer researchers a framework for in-depth analysis of time series data. However, relatively few studies involving time series data obtained from psychological and behavioral research employ such methods. This paucity of application is due to a lack of general analysis frameworks for modeling time series data with strong nonlinear components. In this article, we describe the potential of Hankel alternative view of Koopman (HAVOK) analysis for solving this issue. HAVOK analysis is a unified framework for nonlinear dynamical systems analysis of time series data. By utilizing HAVOK analysis, researchers may model nonlinear time series data in a linear framework while simultaneously reconstructing attractor manifolds and obtaining a secondary time series representing the amount of nonlinear forcing occurring in a system at any given time. We begin by showing the mathematical underpinnings of HAVOK analysis and then show example applications of HAVOK analysis for modeling time series data derived from real psychological and behavioral studies."

Also, hydrodynamics was assessed using the Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) method. Initially, the UASB reactor was operated with synthetic wastewater at Hydraulic Retention Time (HRT) of 24 h in 20 ± 2 °C and 30 ± 2 °C to measure the biogas bubbles production for CFD study. COD removal efficiencies of 85 ± 3% and 95 ± 3%, respectively, with production of 27 and 39 ml CH4/h, correspondingly, were observed. After that, the reactor was fed with complex industrial wastewater. It was evaluated at 24 h in both temperatures. At 30 °C, low COD removal efficiency was observed, being 48 ± 13%, with methane production of 20 ± 3 ml CH4/h. The plug flow pattern was observed in the CFD modelling at HRT of 24 h and 20 °C without considering biogas bubbles interaction. Similar hydrodynamic behaviour was observed at HRT of 24 h and 30 °C. Nonetheless, when biogas bubbles were considered in the CFD modelling, hydrodynamics significantly changed, passing from a plug flow to a complete mix flow pattern."

A global perspective,"Yang, Bo; Jahanger, Atif; Khan, Muhammad Atif","In recent decades, remittances inflow has become a major source of capital which has multidimensional consequences on various economic indicators and potentially associated with CO(2)emissions. This study investigates the impact of remittances, energy use, and globalization on CO(2)emissions using a global sample of 97 countries during 1990-2016. Our findings based on robust system GMM indicate that remittances and energy use increases CO(2)emissions, however, globalization reduces CO(2)emissions. To capture the national difference, this study divides the global sample into two sub-samples: first comprised of developed countries and second developing and emerging countries. Interestingly our findings are similar in both sub-samples. Further, our results are robust to various robustness checks, which ensures the reliability of our findings. Based on our results, we suggest governments, regulators and other stakeholders to mitigate the adverse impact of remittances and energy use on environmental quality by strict market regulations and monitoring, allocating substantial financial resource to research and development for innovating environmental friendly production technologies and renewable energy sources and by giving incentives i.e tax rebates and subsidies on imports of environment-friendly production technology from the advanced countries. Lastly, considering the negative impact of globalization on CO(2)emissions, governments can use globalization as a tool to reduce CO(2)emissions and promote environmental quality."
1312,Another outlook to sector-level energy consumption in Pakistan from dominant energy sources and correlation with economic growth,"Rehman, Abdul; Ma, Hengyun; Ozturk, Ilhan; Ahmad, Munir; Rauf, Abdul; Irfan, Muhammad","The present study seeks to investigate the sector-level energy consumption of oil and natural gas and to explore the linkage between economic growth, households, agriculture, industry, power, fertilizers, and commercial sector in Pakistan for the period of 1980-2016. The energy sector of Pakistan is facing severe crisis from the last few years due to inadequate production and supply. Long-lasting deficits of natural gas and oil, the two supreme types of fuel in Pakistan, had detrimental consequences for the growth as well as for the economic development. An autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) method and Granger causality test under vector error correction model (VECM) were employed to check the association among the variables. Furthermore, the innovative accounting method was used to investigate the responsiveness of each variable to another within the study framework. Empirical results show long-run association among the variables, as oil consumption in the agriculture and power sector show a positive effect on Pakistan's economic growth. Similarly, energy consumption from natural gas in the households and fertilizers as well as in the industry sector has had a constructive association with economic growth. In contrast, energy consumption from oil in the households and industry sectors has adverse association with economic growth, while natural gas consumption in the commercial sector has negative linkage with economic growth. Possible steps should be taken by the Government of Pakistan to enhance the production of oil and natural gas from other alternatives to meet the requirements of these sectors."
1313,Multi-effect distillation plants for small-scale seawater desalination: thermodynamic and economic improvement,"Liponi, Angelica; Wieland, Christoph; Baccioli, Andrea","The growing global demand for fresh water coupled to the increasing interest in renewable energies and waste heat recovery has resulted in flourishing attention to the multi-effect distillation process for seawater desalination. The low operating temperature makes this technology attractive in the case of low temperature heat sources such as geothermal, solar or waste heat recovery. The low energy density of these heat sources requires small-scale desalination systems whose layout and operation may differ from large-scale plant. In this work, new plant configurations for a small-scale multi-effect distillation system are proposed and analyzed from a thermodynamic and economic point of view. Each configuration tends to better exploit the energy content of the various streams by improving heat recovery, according to an increasing layout complexity. These configurations were studied in two layouts, differing in the way seawater and brine fed the various effect. The feed mass flow in each effect was varied to maximize the recovery ratio by imposing the maximum salt concentration in the brine related to calcium sulphate precipitation. Numerical simulations were conducted in Aspen Plus environment by varying the top brine temperature with a fixed bottom brine temperature of 40 degrees C. The electrolyte non-random two liquid equation of state was adopted to evaluate saltwater properties and an inter-model comparison with a validated algebraic model was carried out. The configurations implementing seawater preheating increased the performance ratio up to 10% due to the better exploitation of the energy content of distillate streams. The proposed solutions with the maximization of the recovery ratio demonstrated to be cost-effective with respect to the base multi-effect distillation configuration when thermal energy cost became relevant. In the case of negligible thermal energy cost (waste heat recovery) the base configuration was the preferable solution in terms of water cost, despite the lower performance ratio."

A total of fifteen Sangsari male lambs with an average body weight of 48 ± 2 kg and an average age of 8 ± 1 months were randomly allocated to one of three experimental treatments: (1) PalOil group received a calcium soap of palm oil fatty acids in the diet as source of palmitic acid (16:0), (2) SunOil group received a calcium soap of sunflower oil fatty acids in the diet as source of linoleic acid (n-6 18:2), and (3) LinOil group received a calcium soap of linseed oil fatty acids in the diet as source of α-linolenic acid (n-3 18:3). The greatestand the least expression of IL-4 mRNA were measured in SunOil and LinOil groups, respectively. Expression of IL-8 mRNA was greater in SunOil treatment when compared with PalOil and LinOil groups. In conclusion, the results of the study confirmed that inclusion of α-linolenic acid in virally infected lambs'diet results in lower expression of IL-4 and IL-8 mRNA."
1315,Factors driving oil price - from the perspective of United States,"Su, Chi-Wei; Qin, Meng; Tao, Ran; Moldovan, Nicoleta-Claudia; Lobont, Oana-Ramona","This paper chooses monthly data covering the period from 1990:M1 to 2018:M12 to investigate the contributions of partisan conflicts (PCI), the dollar index (USDX) and U.S. oil production (PRO) on the oil price (OP) by applying the time-varying parameter-stochastic volatility-vector autoregression (TVP-SV-VAR) model. The empirical results are consistent with the general equilibrium model, which states that the PCI has certain influences on the OP. However, the impact of the PCI is less than that of the USDX, and the negative effect of the USDX was strengthened after the global economic crisis. Moreover, the PRO is less important to the oil market than the PCI and USDX. In general, we can conclude that there are important roles that U.S. factors play in the oil market, especially those of partisan conflicts and the dollar value. Understanding the effects of U.S. factors on the oil market can provide revelations for countries, allowing them to formulate energy policies and stabilize the oil market. Additionally, an understanding of these factors can allow investors to adjust their investment decisions and diversify their assets. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."

It is important that integrated optimization of passive performance by considering energy demand, cost and thermal comfort. This paper proposed a set three-stage multi-objective optimization method that combines redundancy analysis (RDA), Gradient Boosted Decision Trees (GBDT) and Non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) for PH design. The method has strong engineering applicability, by reducing the model complexity and improving efficiency. Among then, the GBDT algorithm was first applied to the passive performance optimization of buildings, which is used to build meta-models of building performance. Compared with the commonly used meta-model, the proposed models demonstrate superior robustness with the standard deviation at 0.048. The optimization results show that the energy-saving rate is about 88.2% and the improvement of thermal comfort is about 37.8% as compared to the base-case building. The economic analysis, the payback period were used to integrate initial investment and operating costs, the minimum payback period and uncomfortable level of Pareto frontier solution are 0.48 years and 13.1%, respectively. This study provides the architects rich and valuable information about the effects of the parameters on the different building performance. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."

The effects of extremely low-frequency electromagnetic fields, such as second-generation and third-generation radiation, have been studied in most studies. The current study aimed to explore fourth-generation cellular phone radiation on hippocampal morphology and behavior in mice. Swiss albino male mice (n = 30) were randomly categorized into 3 groups; control, 40 min, and 60 min exposure to 2400 MHz radiofrequency electromagnetic radiation (RF-EMR) daily for 60 days. The control mice were housed in the same environments but were not exposed to anything. Anxiety-like behaviors were tested using the elevated plus-maze. For histological and stereological examination, the brain was dissected from the cranial cavity. On Cresyl violet stained brain slices, the number of pyramidal neurons in the cornu ammonis of the hippocampus were counted. In exposed mice compared to control mice, a significant increase in anxiety-like behavior has been observed. Histological observations have shown many black and dark blue cytoplasmic cells with shrunken morphology degenerative alterations in the neuronal hippocampus in the radiation exposed mice. In the RF-EMR mouse hippocampus, stereological analyses revealed a significant decrease in pyramidal and granule neurons compared to controls. Our findings suggest that 2400-MHz RF-EMR cell phone radiation affects the structural integrity of the hippocampus, which would lead to behavioral changes such as anxiety. However, it alerts us to the possible long-term detrimental effects of exposure to RF-EMR."
1320,Techno-economic and life cycle assessment of an integrated hydrothermal carbonization system for sewage sludge,"Medina-Martos, Enrique; Istrate, Ioan-Robert; Villamil, John A.; Galvez-Martos, Jose-Luis; Dufour, Javier; Mohedano, Angel F.","The need of more effective solutions for sewage sludge management is twofold: i) to alleviate the overall operating costs for wastewater treatment and ii) to ensure proper utilization/disposal considering environmental legislation. A comprehensive solution integrating hydrothermal carbonization and anaerobic digestion to treat sewage sludge was analyzed and compared with that of standalone anaerobic digestion. In order to evaluate its performance, a process simulation model in Aspen Plus (R) served as the main data source of the required input-output inventories to perform both techno-economic and life cycle assessment, which follow conventional methodological standards. It was observed that the integrated strategy generally reduces the environmental impacts compared to the standalone configuration due to the recovery of a hydrochar that could replace fossil fuels. In contrast, the standalone option only recovers a digestate that can generate even a higher impact than its counterfactual alternative. The integration of hydrothermal treatments showed an increase of 14% in the gross energy efficiency of the anaerobic digestion. However, economic concerns make the approach to require further optimization, since the estimated cost for the HTC option were 42% higher in comparison to the conventional anaerobic digestion alternative. Although there is a changing regulatory framework around sewage sludge, especially on nutrient recovery, hydrothermal treatments have been proven as a potentially sustainable route for sewage sludge treatment.

Most CSAs develop relationships that build a sense of community, and engage in activities that facilitate access to food and economic opportunities. CSAs may also contribute to personal development, education and income, working experience, and knowledge. CSA principles align with the principles of HC, specifically the pursuit of economic development. While research on the connection between CSA and HC has broadly focused on the economic aspect, the human development dimension has remained at the conceptual level. The purpose of this study was to assess the potential HC contributions by CSA and the implications for health outcomes in central/northern New Mexico. Primary and secondary data were collected through a semi-structured, open-ended questionnaire and an internet search. Purposive sampling was used to select 13 CSAs. Eight (61.5%) responded and reported activities that address HC and SDH such as training, job creation, education, access to healthy food, food security, health education and disease management, social connections, and food justice. Given the potential impact, public health must contribute to CSA by generating evidence on its health and social benefits, training practitioners on supporting local food program, and promoting policy that stimulates the local economy, fosters social relations and food justice, and empowers community members. This study calls for research and practice to take a multilevel perspective on the contribution of LFSs to equity and wellbeing."

The aerobic biodegradation rate, organic toxicity, and microbial community structure at different acclimation stages of degradation of hydroquinone by activated sludge were investigated. In each acclimation cycle, the removal of hydroquinone reached 100% after 5 days, indicating that high-concentration hydroquinone in the activated sludge could be completely biodegraded. When the microbial flora was inhibited by the influent hydroquinone, the enzyme system experienced stress conditions and led to the secretion of secondary metabolites, extracellular protein of 5-10 kDa mainly contributing to the sludge organic toxicity. Microbial diversity analysis showed that with the increase of the concentration of hydroquinone, β-Proteus bacteria such as Azoarcus and Dechloromonas gradually accumulated, which improved the removal of hydroquinone with aerobic activated sludge in the sequencing batch reactor (SBR) system. As the inhibition degree exceeded the appropriate tolerance range of microorganisms, bacteria would secrete much more secondary metabolites, and the organic toxicity of sludge would reach a relatively high level."
1323,Modeling and performance analysis of a fully solar-powered stand-alone sweeping gas membrane distillation desalination system for island and coastal households,"Li, Guopei; Lu, Lin","Solar-powered membrane distillation is a promising desalination technology. This study newly proposed a solar-powered stand-alone sweeping gas membrane distillation desalination system to provide flexible fresh water for remote island households without reliable infrastructure, such as water and power supplies. Solar energy is the only source of energy to drive the system. A solar thermal collector is installed to provide thermal energy and a solar photovoltaic array is installed to supply direct current power respectively. To evaluate the system performance, a system-scale mathematical model was established and validated by test results under real meteorological conditions. The performance of the major components of the system, including the thermal efficiency of the solar thermal collector, the electrical efficiency of the photovoltaic array, the humidification efficiency of the hollow-fiber-membrane module and the dehumidification efficiency of the condenser, was analyzed. The effects of structural parameters, such as solar collector area, solar photovoltaic area, and desalination operating parameters, on system freshwater yield and Gained Output Ratio were investigated. In addition, the system's daily freshwater production in each month was predicted under local weather conditions of Hong Kong. In summary, for the proposed system, the average daily freshwater production is between 9.98 kg/d and 23.26 kg/d (9.98 kg/d in January and 23.26 kg/d in July), which is enough to meet the daily drinking water demand of a typical family of four (two adults and two children). The ratio of solution flow rate to air flow rate should be selected in the range of 4.0-6.0 to obtain the optimal freshwater yield. The average thermal efficiency of the solar thermal collector is 50%, which is about three times as much as the power conversion efficiency of the solar photovoltaic panels (about 15%). Thus, the solar collector area shows a more significant impact on the system performance than the photovoltaic area. The final water production cost of the system is about 18.34 $/m(3). The system proposed in this paper as a small-scale fully solar-powered desalination system is attractive to provide a flexible and reliable fresh water supply for island and coastal households."
1324,Musical and linguistic syntactic processing in agrammatic aphasia: An ERP study,"Brianne Chiappetta,Aniruddh D Patel,Cynthia K Thompson,Brianne Chiappetta,Aniruddh D Patel,Cynthia K Thompson","Language and music rely on complex sequences organized according to syntactic principles that are implicitly understood by enculturated listeners. Across both domains, syntactic processing involves predicting and integrating incoming elements into higher-order structures. According to the Shared Syntactic Integration Resource Hypothesis (SSIRH; Patel, 2003), musical and linguistic syntactic processing rely on shared resources for integrating incoming elements (e.g., chords, words) into unfolding sequences. One prediction of the SSIRH is that people with agrammatic aphasia (whose deficits are due to syntactic integration problems) should present with deficits in processing musical syntax. We report the first neural study to test this prediction: event-related potentials (ERPs) were measured in response to musical and linguistic syntactic violations in a group of people with agrammatic aphasia (n=7) compared to a group of healthy controls (n=14) using an acceptability judgement task. The groups were matched with respect to age, education, and extent of musical training. Violations were based on morpho-syntactic relations in sentences and harmonic relations in chord sequences. Both groups presented with a significant P600 response to syntactic violations across both domains. The aphasic participants presented with a reduced-amplitude posterior P600 compared to the healthy adults in response to linguistic, but not musical, violations. Participants with aphasia did however present with larger frontal positivities in response to violations in both domains. Intriguingly, extent of musical training was associated with larger posterior P600 responses to syntactic violations of language and music in both groups. Overall, these findings are not consistent with the predictions of the SSIRH, and instead suggest that linguistic, but not musical, syntactic processing may be selectively impaired in stroke-induced agrammatic aphasia. However, the findings also suggest a relationship between musical training and linguistic syntactic processing, which may have clinical implications for people with aphasia, and motivates more research on the relationship between these two domains."

R. J.; Beck, P. S. A.; Boscia, D.; Navas-Cortes, J. A.; Zarco-Tejada, P. J.","Outbreaks of Xylella fastidiosa (Xf) in Europe generate considerable economic and environmental damage, and this plant pest continues to spread. Detecting and monitoring the spatio-temporal dynamics of the disease symptoms caused by Xf at a large scale is key to curtailing its expansion and mitigating its impacts. Here, we combined 3-D radiative transfer modelling (3D-RTM), which accounts for the seasonal background variations, with passive optical satellite data to assess the spatio-temporal dynamics of Xf infections in olive orchards. We developed a 3D-RTM approach to predict Xf infection incidence in olive orchards, integrating airborne hyperspectral imagery and freely available Sentinel-2 satellite data with radiative transfer modelling and field observations. Sentinel-2A time series data collected over a two-year period were used to assess the temporal trends in Xf-infected olive orchards in the Apulia region of southern Italy. Hyperspectral images spanning the same two-year period were used for validation, along with field surveys; their high resolution also enabled the extraction of soil spectrum variations required by the 3D-RTM to account for canopy background effect. Temporal changes were validated with more than 3000 trees from 16 orchards covering a range of disease severity (DS) and disease incidence (DI) levels. Among the wide range of structural and physiological vegetation indices evaluated from Sentinel-2 imagery, the temporal variation of the Atmospherically Resistant Vegetation Index (ARVI) and Optimized Soil-Adjusted Vegetation Index (OSAVI) showed superior performance for DS and DI estimation (r(VALUES)(2) > 0.7, p < 0.001). When seasonal understory changes were accounted for using modelling methods, the error of DI prediction was reduced 3-fold. Thus, we conclude that the retrieval of DI through model inversion and Sentinel-2 imagery can form the basis for operational vegetation damage monitoring worldwide. Our study highlight the value of interpreting temporal variations in model retrievals to detect anomalies in vegetation health."

In this study, we investigated the influencing factors of PM2.5 by employing the Logarithmic Mean Divisia Index (LMDI). The sensitivity of PM2.5 to various emission reduction factors was also explored. Then, by constructing an indicator of PM2.5 decoupling efforts (PDE), PDE of different regions and the degree of efforts caused by various factors were explored. Finally, the spatiotemporal heterogeneity of internal and external factors influencing PDE was explored using the Geographically and Temporally Weighted Regression Model (GTWR). The main results are as follows. (1) The emission coefficient was the main negative driving factor of changes in PM2.5, and per capita GDP was the main positive driving factor. (2) The sensitivity of PM2.5 to emission reduction factors in most regions followed the ranking: emission coefficient > energy intensity > population. In the analysis of the sensitivity of PM2.5 to various emission reduction factors throughout the country, the sensitivity of the emission coefficient was highest in Shandong province. (3) From 2000 to 2014, all provinces made decoupling efforts (PDE>0), among which PDE in Guizhou province were the largest. According to various indicators of decoupling efforts, the contribution of decoupling effort of emission coefficient was the largest. (4) All influencing factors exhibited spatiotemporal heterogeneity. In most regions, the interaction between environmental regulation and industrial structure had a positive impact on PDE, which verifies the existence of the ""Porter Hypothesis"". However, in some central and western regions, this interaction exhibited a dynamic change from negative to positive. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."
1327,Testing the environmental Kuznets Curve hypothesis for E-waste in the EU28+2 countries,"Boubellouta, Bilal; Kusch-Brandt, Sigrid","This paper investigates the Kuznets Curve hypothesis for e-waste using a balanced panel of 30 European countries (EU28 + 2) over the period 2000e2016. To account for the dynamic and the time-invariant characteristics, we employed the generalized method of moments (GMM) estimator as a core method and used the 2SLS estimator and cross-section method to analyze the robustness of results. We found that the Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) hypothesis is well supported for e-waste generated in the EU28 + 2 area. In addition, this relationship is robust and is not sensitive to the choice of control variables and the estimation methods. All three methods evidenced EKC in e-waste for the studied European area. This reveals that e-waste generation increases with an increasing GDP up to a certain GDP level (turning point), but thereafter decreases despite further economic growth. While this suggests that ewaste generation and the related adverse environmental impacts will decline at elevated GDP levels, the results of this study highlight that the turning point occurs at rather exceptionally high levels of GDP. The evidence of EKC in e-waste contributes to better understanding the interlinkage between economic growth and e-waste generation, but it does not diminish the urgent need to implement effective e-waste collection and valorization schemes.

1328,Urbanization and energy consumption effects on carbon dioxide emissions: evidence from Asian-8 countries using panel data analysis,"Abbasi, Muhammad Ali; Parveen, Shabana; Khan, Saleem; Kamal, Muhammad Abdul","The developing world is facing pivotal challenges in recent times. Among these, global warming has ominous repercussions on every segment of society, thus tracing its underlying causes is imperative. This research attempts to investigate the impact of urbanization and energy consumption on carbon dioxide emissions (CO2) for a panel of 8 Asian countries (Bangladesh, China, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Nepal, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka) over the period 1982 to 2017. The analyses are executed using panel co-integration and Granger causality techniques. The main findings of panel co-integration reveal a long-run relationship between urbanization, energy consumption, and CO2 emissions. Furthermore, the results indicate a positive and significant impact of urbanization and energy consumption on CO2 emissions, indicating that urban development and high energy consumptions are barriers to improve environmental quality in the long run. The results also highlight bi-directional causality between energy consumption and urbanization, while unidirectional causality exists between energy consumption and CO2 emissions. Based on the obtained results, this study offers useful policy implications for plummeting carbon emissions."

Because of the existence of a chiral carbon center, PG forms R (Rectus)- and S (Sinister)-enantiomers. Currently, the toxicity study of its R-, S-enantiomers is still very scarce. In this study, we have assessed the developmental toxicity and neurotoxicity of the R-, S-, and RS-PG enantiomers in zebrafish larvae. We found that exposure to R-, S-, and RS-PG enantiomers did not significantly affect the basic developmental endpoints of embryos or larvae (i.e., embryonic movement, hatching, mortality, malformation, heartbeat, body length), indicating that R-, S-, and RS-PG exposures did not exhibit the basic developmental toxicity in zebrafish larvae. The toxicity of three enantiomers was lower than that of ethanol, and there was no significant difference between them. However, R-, S-, and RS-PG exposures with high doses could significantly change the eye diameter and locomotor activity of larval zebrafish, indicating that R-, S-, and RS-PG enantiomers of high doses could potentially exhibit the neurotoxicity and ocular developmental toxicity in zebrafish larvae. Therefore, the potential neurotoxicity and ocular developmental toxicity of R-, S-, and RS-PG enantiomers for infants and toddlers should be considered."

Herein, an iron ore tailings-based Fenton-like catalyst (I/W(3:1)-900-60) with a relatively fast catalysis rate was constructed by co-pyrolysis (900°C, 60 min holding time) of iron ore tailings and wheat straw with a mass ratio of 3:1. With wheat straw blending, the generated I/W(3:1)-900-60 presented a larger surface area (24.53 m2/g), smaller pore size (3.76 nm), reduced iron species (Fe2+ from magnetic), and a higher catalytic activity (0.0229 min-1) than I-900-60 (1.32 m2/g, 12.87 nm, 0.012 min-1) pyrolyzed using single iron ore tailing under the same pyrolysis conditions. In addition, biochar and iron ore tailings in I/W(3:1)-900-60 were tightly combined through chemical bonding. The optimal catalyst remains active after three cycles, indicating its catalytic stability and recyclability. The good Fenton-like methylene blue degradation efficiency of I/W(3:1)-900-60 was ascribed to the sacrificial role of biochar, as well as the electron transfer between biochar and iron active sites or the redox cycles of ≡Fe3+/Fe2+. This finding provides a facile construction strategy for highly active iron ore tailings-based Fenton-like catalyst and thereby had a great potential application in wastewater treatment."
1331,Low carbon roadmap of residential building sector in China: Historical mitigation and prospective peak,"Ma, Minda; Ma, Xin; Cai, Wei; Cai, Weiguang","Fast-growing carbon emissions from the residential building sector are a hindrance for China to achieve its 2030 emission peak goal. To identify future low carbon roadmaps of residential buildings, this study is the first to assess the historical carbon mitigation and simulate the energy and emission peaks of China's residential building sector using a dynamic emission scenario. It shows that the emission mitigation of the residential building sector during 2000-2015 is 1.817 (+/- 0.643) billion tons of carbon dioxide (BtCO(2)), and the normal distribution-based scenario simulation demonstrates that the residential building sector will achieve its carbon emission peak in 2037 (+/- 4) with a peak value of 1.419 (+/- 0.081) BtCO(2). The sensitivity analysis reveals that the impacts of floor space per capita and energy intensity of urban residential buildings are the most significant for the uncertainty of emission peaks. A strict energy demand benchmark of the residential building sector suggests a control at 0.661 billion tons of standard coal equivalent (Btce), and its peaking time is estimated for 2035, which is 5 years ahead of the business-as-usual scenario, with energy savings of 0.042 Btce. For the earliest peaking time, if the residential building sector aims to achieve its emission peak before 2030, the emission peak should be controlled at 1.258 BtCO(2). Overall, this paper can assist the government in more accurate and feasible building emission mitigation strategies. Moreover, the results provide a more powerful decision-making reference in issuing targeted and feasible strategies for future residential building emission mitigation."

Although these models can predict the effect of CPPs on product yield, there is room to improve CQA prediction performance by capturing the complex relationships in high-dimensional data. In this regard, machine learning (ML) approaches offer immense potential in handling non-linear datasets and thus are able to identify new CPPs that could effectively predict the CQAs. ML techniques can also be synergized with mechanistic models as a 'hybrid ML' or 'white box ML' to identify how CPPs affect the product yield and quality mechanistically, thus enabling rational design and control of the bioprocess. In this review, we describe the role of statistical modeling in Quality by Design (QbD) for biomanufacturing, and provide a generic outline on how relevant ML can be used to meaningfully analyze bioprocessing datasets. We then offer our perspectives on how relevant use of ML can accelerate the implementation of systematic QbD within the biopharma 4.0 paradigm."
1333,"Magnetic adsorbent developed with alkali-thermal pretreated biogas slurry solids for the removal of heavy metals: optimization, kinetic, and equilibrium study","Roshini Sasidharan,Arvind Kumar,Roshini Sasidharan,Arvind Kumar","Discharge of effluents containing heavy metal without adequate treatment causes contamination of water resources and creates environmental and health issues. Adsorption could be applied to remediate heavy metals from wastewater effectively. In this study, a low-cost adsorbent was prepared by magnetic modification of pretreated biogas slurry solids (BSS) to remove heavy metals such as Cu2+, Cd2+, and Pb2+. The temperature (423 K) and time (1.5 h) of pretreatment, the BSS to KOH ratio (1:10 w/v), and the ratio of magnetic iron nanoparticle (MIN) to pretreated BSS (PSS) (1:2 w/w) were optimized for the preparation of adsorbent. The magnetically modified pretreated biogas slurry solid (MMPSS) adsorbent was characterized by BET isotherm, FTIR, XRD, FESEM, VSM, and EDX analysis. MMPSS attained equilibrium at 60 min and showed an adsorption capacity of 26.84 mg/g, 24.79 mg/g, and 23.86 mg/g with removal percentages 89.46%, 82.63%, and 79.54% for Cu2+, Cd2+, and Pb2+, respectively, at 310 K and pH 6 with an initial concentration of 150 mg/L. The adsorption process followed a pseudo second-order model with an R2 value above 0.9 for all metals with a well-approaching equilibrium pattern. The good fit of experimental data by the Langmuir isotherm model implied monolayer adsorption. The metal ions adsorbed onto MMPSS were able to desorb effectively in the presence of HCl and retained 83.01%, 84.66%, and 81.83% of the initial adsorption capacity for Cu2+, Cd2+, and Pb2+ respectively after 5 consecutive cycles."
1334,"Is a liveable city a healthy city? Health impacts of urban and transport planning in Vienna, Austria","Khomenko, Sasha; Nieuwenhuijsen, Mark; Ambros, Albert; Wegener, Sandra; Mueller, Natalie","Each year, The Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU) computes the Global Liveability Index and determines the most liveable cities around the world. Vienna, Austria, was ranked by the EIU as the most liveable city worldwide in 2018 and 2019. However, the relationship between a liveable as well as healthy and environmentally-just city has not been previously explored. To explore whether the most liveable city is also a healthy and environmentally-just one, we estimated the premature mortality burden related to non-compliance with international exposure level recommendations for physical activity (PA), air pollution (PM2.5 and NO2), road traffic noise, green space and heat for Vienna, as well as its distribution by socioeconomic status (SES). We applied the Urban and TranspOrt Planning Health Impact Assessment (UTOPHIA) methodology and estimated the annual mortality, life expectancy (LE) and economic impact of non-compliance with exposure guidelines for the Viennese adult population >= 20 years. We compared current with recommended exposure levels, quantified the association between exposures and mortality and calculated attributable health impact fractions. Eight percent of premature mortality (i.e. 1239 deaths, 95% CI: 679-1784) was estimated to be attributable to non-compliance with the recommended exposure levels. Seventy-six percent of the attributable premature mortality was due to PM2.5 exposure and insufficient PA. Non-compliance also resulted in an average of 199 days of LE lost for the adult population (95% CI: 111-280) and an economic impact of 4.6 (95% CI: 2.5-6.7) billion 2015(sic) annually. Overall, residents of lower SES neighbourhoods faced higher risk of premature mortality due to higher exposure to NO2, road traffic noise, heat and less green space. Despite high liveability standards according to EIU definition, a considerable premature mortality burden was attributable to non-compliance with exposure recommendations, and socioeconomic inequalities were estimated. Although the exposure attributable mortality burden was lower than in other European cities and local Viennese policies favour the reduction of motorized traffic, alongside the promotion of active and public transport and urban greening, there is room for further alignment of liveability, environmental health and justice objectives."
1335,Insect Farming for Feed and Food Production from a Circular Business Model Perspective,"Madau, Fabio A.; Arru, Brunella; Furesi, Roberto; Pulina, Pietro","The studies focused on the use of insects have outlined numerous reasons for using insects as food and feed as an important method to increase food opportunities for consumers. Insects have been emphasized as a food source with a low environmental impact due to the limited requirement for arable land and water, low ecological cost, and high-quality protein provision. In Europe and Western countries, insect farming is a growing business in which, however, some critical economic aspects must be recognized. The sector needs to be adequately promoted to rationally exploit the huge amount of potential. As such, the aim of this study was to analyze the recent research on economic aspects related to insect farming for feed and food production with the purpose of providing evidence of the critical economic points in this emerging sector. The focus was mainly oriented to understanding how insect farming can foster virtuous circular economic processes, specifically considering economic aspects on the basis of the limited literature currently available and the circular economic principles. A circular business model approach was proposed to address the entire insect-based feed and food supply chain from a circular economic perspective. In our opinion, the findings underline some economic research questions that need to be addressed in the near future, and the conceptual approach can be individualized to help increase cost- and eco-effectiveness from a circular economic perspective."
1336,What are the critical barriers to the development of hydrogen refueling stations in China? A modified fuzzy DEMATEL approach,"Xu, Chuanbo; Wu, Yunna; Dai, Shuyu","Hydrogen fuel cell vehicle is one of the important modalities of the next generation of new energy vehicles. As the basic infrastructure of hydrogen fuel cell vehicles, hydrogen refueling stations (HRSs) have drawn attention from all social circles. However, hindered by various barriers, the development of HRSs is much slower than the Chinese government's expectation. Hence, this study aims to explore critical barriers of the HRS development in China based on a modified fuzzy decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL) method. Firstly, a barrier list is identified through a literature survey and expert consultation, which consists of four categories (economic, technological, social and political-regulatory aspect) and 12 potential barriers. Later, considering the subjectivity of threshold setting in the traditional fuzzy DEMATEL method, the K-means clustering algorithm is utilized to optimize the threshold value, and thus a modified fuzzy DEMATEL approach is proposed to investigate the prominence of these barriers and the cause-effect relationships among them. The results show that six barriers are regarded as key barriers to China's HRS development, and corresponding policy measures are formulated to mitigate or eliminate these critical barriers."
1337,Feasibility of incorporating autoclaved aerated concrete waste for cement replacement in sustainable building materials,"He, Xingyang; Zheng, Zhengqi; Yang, Jin; Su, Ying; Wang, Tingwei; Strnadel, Bohumir","Autoclaved aerated concrete waste (AACW) is a common low-strength cement-based construction and demolition waste, which is currently disposed by landfills and hard to be directly used as supplementary cementitious material. The present work proposed a potential approach incorporating AACW for cement substitution in sustainable building materials. Wet-milling technique was used to dispose and improve the fineness of AACW (median particle size, as low as 2.3 mu m). It was proved that AACW is suitable for wet-milling treatment due to its porous texture and low-strength. The pH value and electrical conductivity of the AACW slurry was notably improved. Water requirement was increased by the ultrafine AACW. Both setting time and the main hydration heat location were obviously brought forward by ultrafine AACW, indicating its early hydration acceleration. Compressive strength of ultrafine AACW replaced cement pastes present higher or equivalent value compared with pure cement paste, within 30% replacement level. Pore structure was effectively refined by the ultrafine wet-milling AACW. It was proved that AACW could be efficiently used as an alternative cementitious material in cement and concrete after wet-milling treatment, thus bring environmental and economic benefits.

1338,Thermal optimization of shell and tube heat exchanger using porous baffles,"Mohammadi, Mohammad Hadi; Abbasi, Hamid Reza; Yavarinasab, Adel; Pourrahmani, Hossein","In this study, total heat transfer rate and pressure drop along a shell and tube heat exchanger (STHX) with 6 porous baffles are numerically investigated. To study the impacts of segmental porous baffles, three values for the permeability (10(-9) m(2), 10(-12) m(2), and 10(-15) m(2)), porosity (0.2, 0.5, and 0.8), and baffle cut (25%, 35%, 50%) were considered, and the output parameters were calculated. Low baffle cuts provided the highest heat transfer; however, it generated a considerable amount of pressure drop as well. Although the porosity of 0.2 was superior in terms of heat transfer, higher pressure drop at lower baffle cut is the obstacle to consider it as the optimum value. The data was then utilized to train an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to characterize the STHX and perform the sensitivity analysis. Baffle cut had the highest impact on the heat transfer as well as pressure drop while the porosity had the least in both by having 5% contribution. Finally, using genetic algorithm (GA), the optimum values for permeability, porosity, and baffle cut are calculated to gain the maximum heat transfer and minimum pressure drop in the system."

Every PP Lactating mare on the day of parturition was paired with a N-PP Cycling mare, and the data analyses considered the partum-ovulation interval (POI) and the postpartum interovulatory interval (PPIOI) in PP Lactating mares and two interovulatory intervals in N-PP Cycling mares. The results of the present study revealed several novel and unique aspects of DF development and FSH and LH dynamics before ovulation in PP Lactating mares when compared with N-PP Cycling mares. The most remarkable differences between both groups of mares were the following: (1) a shorter interval to ovulation in PP Lactating mares during the foal heat (POI ≤22 days) compared with all other intervals; (2) a larger DF in PP Lactating mares, and an earlier day of DF at maximum diameter during the foal heat; and (3) lower gonadotropin levels in PP Lactating mares. Regarding the particularities, PP Lactating mares had lower LH levels during the POI than the PPIOI, demonstrating a strong partum effect; spring-foaled mares had longer POIs, larger DF diameters, and lower LH levels; and lower body condition scores and higher body-weight loss led to longer POIs and smaller DF diameters in PP Lactating mares. This study contributes to a broad understanding of ovarian function in the postpartum mare."

This review aimed at investigating the antimicrobial properties of black pepper (Piper guineense) against foodborne microorganisms. The existence of foodborne illness, food spoilage, food waste, the resulting negative economic impact of these issues, and consumer interests have all pushed the food industry to find alternative, safe, and natural antimicrobials to be used in foods and beverages. Consumers have also influenced the demand for novel antimicrobials due to the perceived association of current synthetic preservatives with diseases and adverse effects on children. They also have a desire for clean-label products. These combined concerns have prompted researchers at investigating plant extracts as potential sources for antimicrobials. Plants possess many antimicrobial properties; therefore, evaluating these plant extracts as a natural source of antimicrobials can lead to a preventative control method in reducing foodborne illness and food spoilage, inclusively meeting consumer needs. In most regions, P. guineense is commonly utilized due to its potent and effective medicinal properties against foodborne microorganisms."
1342,Testing the role of aerobic exercise in the treatment of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms in U.S. active duty military personnel: a pilot study,"Stacey Young-McCaughan,Alan L Peterson,Jim Mintz,Willie J Hale,Katherine A Dondanville,Elisa V Borah,Tabatha H Blount,Abby E Blankenship,Brooke A Fina,Brittany N Hall-Clark,Ann Marie Hernandez,Vanessa M Jacoby,Steffany L Malach,Jacob M Williams,Katherine E Compton,Mona O Bingham,Catherine A Vriend,Alice W Inman,Antoinette Brundige,Sonya M Arzola,M Danet Lapiz-Bluhm,Douglas E Williamson,Brett T Litz,Elizabeth A Hembree,John D Roache,Daniel J Taylor,Kristi E Pruiksma,Adam M Borah,Jeffrey S Yarvis,Stacey Young-McCaughan,Alan L Peterson,Jim Mintz,Willie J Hale,Katherine A Dondanville,Elisa V Borah,Tabatha H Blount,Abby E Blankenship,Brooke A Fina,Brittany N Hall-Clark,Ann Marie Hernandez,Vanessa M Jacoby,Steffany L Malach,Jacob M Williams,Katherine E Compton,Mona O Bingham,Catherine A Vriend,Alice W Inman,Antoinette Brundige,Sonya M Arzola,M Danet Lapiz-Bluhm,Douglas E Williamson,Brett T Litz,Elizabeth A Hembree,John D Roache,Daniel J Taylor,Kristi E Pruiksma,Adam M Borah,Jeffrey S Yarvis","The purpose of this pilot study was to determine if the efficacy of imaginal exposure for symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) could be improved by adding aerobic exercise. We hypothesized that aerobic exercise would enhance the efficacy of exposure therapy. Active duty service members with clinically significant symptoms of posttraumatic stress (PTSD Checklist-Stressor-Specific Version, [PCL-S], ≥25) were randomized into one of four conditions: exercise only; imaginal exposure only; imaginal exposure plus exercise; no exercise/no exposure therapy (control). Participants (N = 72) were primarily male, Army, noncommissioned officers ranging in age from 22 to 52. PTSD symptom severity decreased over time (p < .0001); however, there were no significant differences between the experimental conditions. The prediction that imaginal exposure augmented with aerobic exercise would be superior to either imaginal exposure alone or aerobic exercise alone was not supported, suggesting that engaging in exercise and imaginal exposure simultaneously may not be any better than engaging in either activity alone. A better understanding of individually administered and combined exercise and exposure therapy interventions for PTSD is warranted."
1343,Dramatic decrease of flood frequency in the Mekong Delta due to river-bed mining and dyke construction,"Park, Edward; Huu Loc Ho; Dung Duc Tran; Yang, Xiankun; Alcantara, Enner; Merino, Eder; Vu Hai Son","Here we present a proof of concept evaluation of the impacts of riverbed-mining on river-wetland connectivity by analyzing the temporal trends of the flood frequencies in the Vietnamese Mekong Delta (VMD), while accounting for the effect of dyke constructions. We focus on the Long Xuyen Quadrangle (LXQ), which is significant in terms of biodiversity and economic contribution to the VMD as it is one of the most important food baskets of Southeast Asia that depends on seasonal flooding. Our results indicate that the flood frequency in LXQ has decreased significantly over the past 20 years (1995-2015). Time-series analyses of water level data at Chau Doc, Tan Chau, and Can Tho stations confirmed that the overall descending trend is statistically significant (p-value < 0.001 and tau similar to 0.1). However, the river discharge at Kratie showed no significant trend (p-value = 0.98) over the same period. This indicates that the flood frequency is associated with the lowering of the riverbed (incision) other than climatic factors. The connectivity analysis also revealed a remarkable drop in the inundation duration after early 2000, which corresponds to the previous observations of the shifting shoreline of the VMD from construction to shrinking. Finally, regression and principal component analyses underpinned the strong causality between the riverbed-mining and the decreased seasonal flooding patterns in LXQ, while accounting for the effect of the dyke system over the last decades (R-2 = 0.75). This study offers compelling evidences on the relationship between sand-mining in the river and the disrupted flood regimes in VMD. The reduction in water and sediments that is necessary for sustaining current rates of agricultural production in the long term would endanger the livelihoods of millions of VMD inhabitants.

1344,Employment and child support outcomes among noncustodial fathers: An evaluation of the Fathers Advancing Community Together program,"Bryce E Peterson,Lindsey Cramer,Paige S Thompson,Bryce E Peterson,Lindsey Cramer,Paige S Thompson","Prior research underscores the importance of fathers' involvement in their children's lives. However, there is mixed evidence about the degree to which fatherhood programs improve economic stability and child support outcomes among noncustodial fathers. We attempted to address some of these gaps in the literature by evaluating the Fathers Advancing Community Together (FACT) program. FACT was implemented by Rubicon Programs, a community-based nonprofit organization in the Bay Area, California known for providing services to help move people out of poverty. The program provided parents economic stability, responsible parenting, and healthy relationship workshops, as well as support services and intensive case management. We relied on data from the Department of Child Support Services to assess whether FACT increased the likelihood of employment, child support modifications, and child support payments among noncustodial fathers during a 6-month post-enrollment period. Using 3:1 coarsened exact matching procedures, the total sample resulted in 744 fathers (186 in the intervention group and 558 in the comparison group). Results from logistic regression models indicate that FACT participants were more likely to be employed and more likely to receive a child support modification during the post-enrollment period than their comparison counterparts, though we found no significant relationship between FACT participation and whether fathers made a child support payment."

General hospitalists in Japan perform various roles. Thus, the ideal image of general hospitalists there has been unclear. We summarize the 10 key skills for Japanese hospitalists indicated in the specialty programs of the Japanese Society of Hospital General Medicine. We identified the following five crucial points for ideal general hospitalists: general mindset; leadership and management; community-based comprehensive care and cooperation with various professions; appropriate medical interviewing, physical examination, and diagnostic reasoning; and proactive education and academic activities. This paper presents five tips, which deal with why those items are necessary and how they should be learned."
1346,Changing the urban design of cities for health: The superblock model,"Mueller, Natalie; Rojas-Rueda, David; Khreis, Haneen; Cirach, Marta; Andres, David; Ballester, Joan; Bartoll, Xavier; Daher, Carolyn; Deluca, Anna; Echave, Cynthia; Mila, Carles; Marquez, Sandra; Palou, Joan; Perez, Katherine; Tonne, Cathryn; Stevenson, Mark; Rueda, Salvador; Nieuwenhuijsen, Mark","Background: Car-dependent city planning has resulted in high levels of environmental pollution, sedentary lifestyles and increased vulnerability to the effects of climate change. The Barcelona Superblock model is an innovative urban and transport planning strategy that aims to reclaim public space for people, reduce motorized transport, promote sustainable mobility and active lifestyles, provide urban greening and mitigate effects of climate change. We estimated the health impacts of implementing this urban model across Barcelona. Methods: We carried out a quantitative health impact assessment (HIA) study for Barcelona residents >= 20 years (N= 1,301,827) on the projected Superblock area level (N= 503), following the comparative risk assessment methodology. We 1) estimated expected changes in (a) transport-related physical activity (PA), (b) air pollution (NO2), (c) road traffic noise, (d) green space, and (e) reduction of the urban heat island (UHI) effect through heat reductions; 2) scaled available risk estimates; and 3) calculated attributable health impact fractions. Estimated endpoints were preventable premature mortality, changes in life expectancy and economic impacts. Results: We estimated that 667 premature deaths (95% CI: 235-1,098) could be prevented annually through implementing the 503 Superblocks. The greatest number of preventable deaths could be attributed to reductions in NO2 (291, 95% PI: 0-838), followed by noise (163, 95% CI: 83-246), heat (117, 95% CI: 101-137), and green space development (60, 95% CI: 0-119). Increased PA for an estimated 65,000 persons shifting car/motorcycle trips to public and active transport resulted in 36 preventable deaths (95% CI: 26-50). The Superblocks were estimated to result in an average increase in life expectancy for the Barcelona adult population of almost 200 days (95% CI: 99-297), and result in an annual economic impact of 1.7 billion EUR (95% CI: 0.6-2.8). Discussion: The Barcelona Superblocks were estimated to help reduce harmful environmental exposures (i.e. air pollution, noise, and heat) while simultaneously increase PA levels and access to green space, and thereby provide substantial health benefits. For an equitable distribution of health benefits, the Superblocks should be implemented consistently across the entire city. Similar health benefits are expected for other cities that face similar challenges of environmental pollution, climate change vulnerability and low PA levels, by adopting the Barcelona Superblock model."

Examination of the wreck indicates a 19th-century carvel-built vessel. The sandbank is an active environment, meaning the wreck is rarely exposed to its full extent. Discussed here is work completed on the site before and during the social-distancing restrictions imposed by COVID-19. Documentary sources and previous detailed surveys suggest a possible identification for the wreck. The site appears to be an example of an everyday 19th-century coastal trading vessel, rarely explored archaeologically in the UK, with potential to contribute to discussions of the maritime technologies and maritime cultural landscape of regular folk. The investigation represents an excellent example of combining historical and archaeological data sets to further the interpretation of both sources, revealing details about the ship and its lasting impact on this stretch of coastline."
1348,"Inhibitory effect of CC chemokine ligand 23 (CCL23)/ transcription factor activating enhancer binding protein 4 (TFAP4) on cell proliferation, invasion and angiogenesis in hepatocellular carcinoma","Weiwei Wang,Jianjun Wu,Xulei Dai,Kun Cheng,Weiwei Wang,Jianjun Wu,Xulei Dai,Kun Cheng","Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a highly vascularized solid tumor with a fast growth rate. According to bioinformatics analysis, CC chemokine ligand 23 (CCL23) has clinical significance for survival and prognosis in HCC. The online databases TCGA and CCLE were used to analyze the expression level of CCL23, and its expression was also measured in HCC cell lines by RT-qPCR and Western blotting. The STRING database and co-immunoprecipitation were employed to evaluate the association between CCL23 and transcription factor activating enhancer binding protein 4 (TFAP4). Overexpression plasmids for CCL23 (Ov-CCL23) and TFAP4 (Ov-TFAP4) were transfected into Huh-7 cells to detect TFAP4 expression. Huh-7 cells injected with OV-negative control (NC)/Ov-CCL23 or OV-NC/Ov-CCL23 plus Ov-TFAP4 were utilized to study the function of CCL23/TFAP4. Cell proliferation, invasion and human umbilical vein endothelial cell tube formation assays were conducted. The database revealed decreased expression of CCL23 in HCC and that it was commonly downregulated in HCC cell lines. TFAP4 expression was negatively correlated with CCL23. The overexpression of CCL23 inhibited the proliferation and invasion of Huh-7 cells, whereas TFAP4 blocked these effects. Similarly, the supernatant of CCL23-upregulated cells exhibited significantly lower tube formation potential, and low vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA), VEGFRs expression compared with those of non-transfected Huh-7 cells, while TFAP4 plasmid co-transfected markedly increased these. Taken together, the present study suggests that CCL23 is expressed at low levels in HCC; it inhibits HCC cell proliferation, invasion and angiogenesis in vitro; and its action is negatively associated with and can be blocked by TFAP4."
1349,"European commitment to COP21 and the role of energy consumption, FDI, trade and economic complexity in sustaining economic growth","Dogan, Buhari; Balsalobre-Lorente, Daniel; Nasir, Muhammad Ali","The nexus between economic growth and energy consumption has been exhaustively explored, yet the empirical evidence and the theoretical points of view remain at odds. This study contextualises and capitalises on this discrepancy and examines the connection between non-renewable and renewable energy consumption and economic growth, considering the moderating impact of economic complexity, trade openness, FDI and institutional quality. We use a panel quantile regression model and data from 32 European countries in the period 1995-2014. Our key results show that economic complexity, renewable energy consumption, trade openness, FDI and institutional quality enhance economic growth. The results for non-renewable energy consumption showed both a positive and a negative impact in different quantiles, indicating that the consumption of renewable energy is in fact more effective for economic growth than the use of non-renewables. Our findings have far-reaching implications for stakeholders and policymakers working on sustainable economic growth and energy policy with a view to meeting the commitments made under the Paris Agreement (COP21)."

Chlorophylls and carotenoids, both primarily involved in photosynthesis, are found in the grana of chloroplasts, while anthocyanin vacuolar inclusions (AVIs) accumulate for light protection in red-skinned cultivars. A Mie model describing light scattering by absorbing spherical particles in a non-absorbing medium allowed to theoretically investigate the explicit influence of grana and AVIs on the effective scattering coefficient [Formula: see text] and the absorption coefficient [Formula: see text]. The reconstruction of the complex refractive indices of the organelles predicted anomalous dispersion, i.e., a local increase in the real part of the refractive index in the spectral regions with high chlorophyll and anthocyanin absorption, in agreement with the Kramers-Kronig relations. As a result, peaks in [Formula: see text] were predicted to be shifted to longer wavelengths compared to the corresponding [Formula: see text] bands. This selective scattering effect was confirmed experimentally with integrating sphere measurements for red- or green-skinned apple samples of the cultivars 'Elstar', 'Gala' or 'Jonagold'. Comparison between simulations and measurements indicated that the Soret bands of chlorophyll a and chlorophyll b are at 435 nm and 469 nm, respectively, and overlap with the absorption of carotenoids, whose red-most edge is at 488 nm. For anthocyanin absorption, a pronounced blue shift from 550 to 520 nm was observed, indicating structural or chemical changes of AVIs."
1351,A survey of polar stationary phases for hydrophilic interaction chromatography and recent progress in understanding retention and selectivity,"Yong Guo,Yong Guo","Various polar stationary phases are available for hydrophilic interaction chromatography (HILIC) and help drive continuous applications in biomedical, environmental, and pharmaceutical areas in the past decade. Although the stationary phases for HILIC have been reviewed previously, it is an appropriate time to take another look at the progresses made during the past 5 years. The current review provides an overview of the polar stationary phases commercially available for HILIC applications in an effort to assist scientists in selecting suitable columns. New types of stationary phases that were published in literature in the past 5 years are summarized and discussed. The trend in stationary phase research and development is also highlighted. Of particular interest is the experimental evidence for direct interactions of polar analytes with the ligands of the stationary phases under HILIC conditions. In addition, two different approaches have been developed to delineate the relative significance of the partitioning and adsorption mechanisms in HILIC, representing an important advancement in our understanding of the retention mechanisms in HILIC."

1355,Extracellular polymeric substance decomposition linked to hydrogen recovery from waste activated sludge: Role of peracetic acid and free nitrous acid co-pretreatment in a prefermentation-bioelectrolysis cascading system,"Liu, Zhihong; Zhou, Aijuan; Liu, Hongyan; Wang, Sufang; Liu, Wenzong; Wang, Aijie; Yue, Xiuping","Free nitrous acid (FNA) has been recently reported to be an effective and eco-friendly inactivator for waste activated sludge (WAS), while the limited decomposition of the extracellular polymeric substance (EPS) matrix hampers resource recovery from WAS. This work employed peracetic acid (PAA) to assist FNA and explored the contribution of co-pretreatment to hydrogen recovery in a prefermentation-bioelectrolysis cascading system. The results showed that co-pretreatment led to approximately 8.8% and 20.4% increases in the exfoliation of particulate proteins and carbohydrates, respectively, from tightly bound EPS (TB-EPS) over that of sole FNA pretreatment. Electron paramagnetic resonance analysis verified that the synergistic effect of FNA, PAA and various generated free radicals was the essential process. This effect further promoted the accumulation of volatile fatty acids (VFAs) after 96 h of prefermentation, and the peak concentration in co-pretreatedWAS (AD-FPWAS) was approximately 2.5-fold that in sole FNA-pretreated WAS (AD-FWAS). Subsequently, the cascading utilization of organics in the bioelectrolysis step contributed to efficient hydrogen generation. A total of 10.8 +/- 0.3 mg H-2/g VSS was harvested in microbial electrolysis cells (MECs) fed with AD-FPWAS, while 6.2 +/- 0.1 mg H-2/g VSS was obtained from AD-FWAS. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) revealed the effective decomposition of the phospholipid bilayer in the cytomembrane and the transformation of macromolecular organics into VFAs and hydrogen in the cascading system. Further microbial community analysis demonstrated that co-pretreatment enhanced the accumulation of functional consortia, including anaerobic fermentative bacteria (AFB, 28.1%), e.g., Macellibacteroides (6.3%) and Sedimentibacter (6.9%), and electrochemically active bacteria (EAB, 57.0%), e.g., Geobacter (39.0%) and Pseudomonas (13.6%), in the prefermentation and MEC steps, respectively. The possible synergetic and competitive relationships among AFB, EAB, homo-acetogens, nitrate-reducing bacteria and methanogens were explored by molecular ecological network analysis. From an environmental and economic perspective, this promising FNA and PAA co-pretreatment approach provides new insight for energy recovery from WAS biorefineries. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

1356,Environmental regulation and industrial capacity utilization: An empirical study of China,"Yu, Binbin; Shen, Chen","China's current economic development is faced with the two major problems of environmental pollution and production overcapacity. Environmental regulation is not only an effective means of controlling polluting emissions but is also an important factor which can affect industrial capacity utilization (ICU). For this work, 2004 to 2015 panel data from 30 provinces in China was employed to verify the evolution and spatial correlation of both environmental regulation intensity and industrial capacity utilization. The dynamic spatial panel model (DSPM) was then used to examine not only the impact of environmental regulation intensity on industrial capacity utilization but also the compliance cost effect and the innovation offset effect through which the environmental regulation intensity influences industrial capacity utilization. It was found that striking differences exist between provinces with respect to China's environmental regulation intensities and industrial capacity utilization, with a fluctuating but rising trend emerging over time. In parallel with this, there is also a significant spatial correlation in industrial capacity utilization. The results from the DSPM show that increases in environmental regulation intensity can significantly improve industrial capacity utilization. Environmental regulations can also improve industrial capacity utilization through the innovation offset effect, although the compliance cost effect of environmental regulation not significant.

Currently, the largest challenge in the molecular design and drug development of PROTACs is efficient identification of potent and drug-like degraders. This review aims to comprehensively summarize and analyse state-of-the-art methods and strategies in the design of PROTACs. We provide a detailed illustration of the general principles and tactics for designing potent PROTACs, highlight representative case studies, and discuss the advantages and limitations of these strategies. Particularly, structure-based rational PROTAC design and emerging new types of PROTACs (e.g., homo-PROTACs, multitargeting PROTACs, photo-control PROTACs and PROTAC-based conjugates) will be focused on."
1358,Evaluation of city sustainability using multi-criteria decision-making considering interaction among criteria in Liaoning province China,"Chen, Yang; Zhang, Danning","City sustainability is a complex system affected by economic, social, and environmental dimensions, with the existence of interaction and conflict among factor. However, there is a lack of real methodology on the measurement of interaction. Then, this article presents a method to calculate the interaction among multiple criteria, including static interaction and dynamic trend similarity, and to compute the weigh coefficient of each indicator induced by this interaction. In addition, the applicability of the proposed method is demonstrated by evaluating the sustainability performance of 14 cities in Liaoning province China in the context of the Triple Bottom Line (TBL) framework. Our results show that the sustainable development of 14 cities in Liaoning province experienced dramatically downward and has a crucial condition from 2013 to 2017. Only Dalian, Shenyang, Panjin, Benxi, and Yingkou could be classified as a Good level (Level.), and none of cities was an Excellent level (Level.). From spatial-temporal perspective, regional disparities of sustainability are demonstrated by spatial distributions of city sustainability. In detail, the comprehensive sustainability and subsystem exhibit a ""cold-spot in West"" feature. The scores for indicators reveal that the shortage of science expenditure, declining investment in fixed asset, lack of economic growth, and lagging public transportation are the main limit factor faced by most cities. Meanwhile, tertiary industry development, energy efficiency improvement, increase green coverage, and reduce pollutant emissions are primary driving factors for improving sustainability. Comparing with other methods, MCDM considering interaction among criteria is an appropriate method to evaluate city sustainability."

We performed an observational case series of three multigenerational families with high myopia (SER≤-6D), from the departments of Clinical Genetics and Ophthalmology of a tertiary Dutch hospital. Whole-exome sequencing (WES) with a vision-related gene panel was performed, followed by a full open exome sequencing. We identified three Caucasian families with high myopia caused by three different pathogenic variants in the ARR3 gene (c.214C>T, p.Arg72*; c.767+1G>A; p.?; c.848delG, p.(Gly283fs)). Myopia was characterized by a high severity (<-8D), an early onset (<6 years), progressive nature, and a moderate to bad atropine treatment response. Remarkably, a female limited inheritance pattern was present in all three families accordant with previous reports. The frequency of a pathogenic variant in the ARR3 gene in our diagnostic WES cohort was 5%. To conclude, we identified three families with early onset, therapy-resistant, high myopia with a female-limited inheritance pattern, caused by a mutation in the ARR3 gene. The singular mode of inheritance might be explained by metabolic interference due to X-inactivation. Identification of this type of high myopia will improve prompt myopia treatment, monitoring, and genetic counseling."

How loneliness affects social monitoring across the life span,"Ellie Pearce,Manuela Barreto,Christina Victor,Claudia Hammond,Alice M Eccles,Matthew T Richins,Alisha O'Neil,Megan L Knowles,Pamela Qualter,Ellie Pearce,Manuela Barreto,Christina Victor,Claudia Hammond,Alice M Eccles,Matthew T Richins,Alisha O'Neil,Megan L Knowles,Pamela Qualter","Previous experimental work showed that young adults reporting loneliness performed less well on emotion recognition tasks (Diagnostic Analysis of Nonverbal Accuracy [DANVA-2]) if they were framed as indicators of social aptitude, but not when the same tasks were framed as indexing academic aptitude. Such findings suggested that undergraduates reporting loneliness possessed the social monitoring skills necessary to read the emotions underlying others' facial expressions, but that they choked under social pressure. It has also been found that undergraduates reporting loneliness have better recall for both positive and negative social information than their non-lonely counterparts. Whether those effects are evident across different age groups has not been examined. Using data from the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) Loneliness Experiment that included participants aged 16-99 years (N = 54,060), we (i) test for replication in a larger worldwide sample and (ii) extend those linear model analyses to other age groups. We found only effects for participants aged 25-34 years: In this age group, loneliness was associated with increased recall of negative individual information, and with choking under social pressure during the emotion recognition task; those effects were small. We did not find any such effects among participants in other age groups. Our findings suggest that different cognitive processes may be associated with loneliness in different age groups, highlighting the importance of life-course approaches in this area."
1361,Emerging roles of SWI/SNF remodelers in fungal pathogens,"Vinutha K Balachandra,Santanu K Ghosh,Vinutha K Balachandra,Santanu K Ghosh","Fungal pathogens constantly sense and respond to the environment they inhabit, and this interaction is vital for their survival inside hosts and exhibiting pathogenic traits. Since such responses often entail specific patterns of gene expression, regulators of chromatin structure contribute to the fitness and virulence of the pathogens by modulating DNA accessibility to the transcriptional machinery. Recent studies in several human and plant fungal pathogens have uncovered the SWI/SNF group of chromatin remodelers as an important determinant of pathogenic traits and provided insights into their mechanism of function. Here, we review these studies and highlight the differential functions of these remodeling complexes and their subunits in regulating fungal fitness and pathogenicity. As an extension of our previous study, we also show that loss of specific RSC subunits can predispose the human fungal pathogen Candida albicans cells to filamentous growth in a context-dependent manner. Finally, we consider the potential of targeting the fungal SWI/SNF remodeling complexes for antifungal interventions."
1362,"A study on China's economic growth, green energy technology, and carbon emissions based on the Kuznets curve (EKC)","Sun, Yu; Li, Mingxing; Zhang, Mengjuan; Khan, Hira Salah Ud Din; Li, Jiaqiu; Li, Zeyu; Sun, Hongzheng; Zhu, Yue; Anaba, Oswin Aganda","China's rapid economic development is unavoidably characterized by environmental pitfalls, especially the carbon dioxide emissions of greenhouse gases from the use of energy. Since there is a relationship between economic growth, energy consumption, and carbon emission, it is important to note that the continuous improvement and application of solar energy technology will play an active role in carbon emission reduction. Therefore, this paper uses the Kuznets curve to probe the relationship between economic growth, solar energy technology, and carbon emissions. The results show that solar energy technology, economic development level, and carbon emissions are all integrated at the second order with a long-run cointegration relationship. In the long-run, the relationship between economic growth and carbon emissions is inverted ""U,"" which suggest that there is a turning point of carbon emissions, where the carbon emissions first increase with economic growth and then gradually decrease, which is reflected in the image as an inverted ""U"" curve. Also, the impact of economic factors on carbon emissions and the innovation of solar technology can negatively influence carbon emissions, and enhancing the innovation of solar technology has a positive effect on reducing carbon dioxide emissions."

This was a prospective, case-control study conducted in Izmir, Turkey. The aim of this study was to assess the relationship between COVID-19 and new-onset T1DM. We included pediatric patients (aged 6 mo-18 yr) with new-onset type-1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) diagnosed during the COVID-19 pandemic, between April 2020 and January 2021. Polymerase chain reaction was used to diagnose COVID-19 after hospital admission. An enzyme-linked immunoassay for IgM and IgG against SARS-CoV-2 was performed after the diagnosis was confirmed. In the control group, the blood antibody test was conducted as close as possible to the time of the T1DM patient referral. A total of 118 participants were included in the study, comprising 57 (48%) patients with new-onset T1DM and 61 (52%) healthy controls. Of the 57 patients, 36 (63.2%) presented with DKA, 17 (29.7%) with diabetic ketosis, and four (7%) incidentally. The SARS-CoV-2 antibody test was positive in five (8.7%) patients with T1DM and six (10%) controls. The rate of positivity did not differ between the two groups (p = 0.901). It was not possible to demonstrate a clear association between SARS-CoV-2 infection and new-onset T1DM. Whether SARS-CoV-2 increases susceptibility to diabetes by triggering islet cell autoimmunity and affects the timing of overt diabetes in patients with existing autoimmunity should be studied in large cohorts."

In this experiment, three tissue and blood samples of Rex rabbits at 3 growing periods were selected. The expression levels of APMAP gene in different tissues were detected by real-time fluorescence quantitative PCR and the content of APMAP in the blood was detected by Elisa. The results showed that fat deposition, the expression of APMAP in muscle and the content of APMAP in the blood increased rapidly during the growth of Rex rabbits. The correlation analysis showed that the correlation coefficient between APMAP content in the blood and the expression level of APMAP gene in longissimus lumborum muscle was 0.75(p < 0.05); the correlation coefficients between APMAP content in the blood and intramuscular fat and 24-hour pH were 0.90 (p < 0.01) and 0.75 (p < 0.05), respectively. According to the analysis results, we inferred APMAP content in the blood in Rex rabbits may influence meat quality and the meat quality of high APMAP content in the blood in Rex rabbits is better. These results revealed APMAP content in the blood may be one of the important signs for meat quality traits of molecular markers."

Therefore, using latent growth curve modeling, the current study explored adolescents' changes in the frequency of SEIM use before, during, and after a strict lockdown period was established in Belgium. Attention was given to individual differences (i.e., gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, pubertal timing, and sensation seeking). A three-wave panel study over a 15-month period among 522 adolescents was used (Mage = 15.36, SD = 1.51, 67.1% girls). In general, SEIM use did not significantly increase over a 15-month period in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Only gender predicted a change in SEIM use frequencies with girls showing a greater, increasing change of SEIM use than boys. When addressing why adolescents used SEIM during a strict lockdown period, sexual arousal, stress, and boredom regulation motivations emerged as the most prevalent motivations. Loneliness regulation was the least prominent motivation. Individual differences were found regarding the gratifications sought according to adolescents' gender, pubertal timing, and sensation seeking. The findings offer a response to sexual scholars' worries in terms of adolescents' SEIM use during the COVID-19 pandemic."

This paper was conducted to investigate the bio-efficacy of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) in improving phosphorous (P) utilization and increasing the yield of onion plant grown in sandy soil under a drip irrigation system. The obtained results showed that AMF inoculation of onion and application of 120 kg P fertilizer ha-1 significantly increased the fresh and dry weights, chlorophyll content of onion as well as P concentration in the root, shoot, and bulb during two growing seasons. Moreover, AMF increased the bioavailability of P in the rhizosphere and significantly enhanced the N-utilization by the inoculated plant. The economic yield of the onion plant inoculated by AMF and fertilized by different doses of P fertilizer was much higher than that obtained by the control (without AMF). These findings indicated that inoculating the onion plant in the field with AMF could be very effective in increasing the yield of the onion plant. Additionally, this study suggests AMF as a low-cost and promising candidate for the sustainable production of the onion crop using reclaimed sandy soils and a drip irrigation system."
1368,Testing for the existence of the Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) for CO(2)emissions in Ghana: evidence from the bootstrap rolling window Granger causality test,"Minlah, Michael Kaku; Zhang, Xibao","This paper investigates the existence of the Environmental Kuznets Curve for carbon dioxide emissions in Ghana. The causal relationship between economic growth and carbon dioxide emissions being examined and the short-run and long-run parameters of the estimated vector autoregressive models are found to be unstable. This necessitated the use of a time-varying approach and the rolling window Granger causality test to investigate the causal relationship between economic growth and carbon dioxide emissions. We find that GDP has a positive effect on carbon dioxide emissions in the sample periods where GDP Granger causes carbon dioxide emissions. Significant feedbacks from the environment to the economy are observed, with carbon dioxide emissions having a positive effect on GDP in most of the subsample periods. The empirical results show that the Environmental Kuznets Curve for carbon dioxide emissions for Ghana is upward sloping, contrary to the standard Environmental Kuznets Curve theory which postulates an inverted ""U""-shaped relationship between economic growth and environmental degradation. The implication of the result is that carbon dioxide emissions increase with increases in GDP. The study recommends that existing policies designed to ensure environmental sustainability and hence control carbon dioxide emissions need to be strengthened and enforced to ensure that the rapid urbanization and industrialization of the Ghanaian economy does not come at a cost to the quality of the environment"
1369,A Maximum Caliber analysis of the Foldon Hypothesis,"Eric Johnson,Eric Johnson","Different models of protein folding favor different mechanisms. Some models rely on a defined pathway, while other models rely on a more heterogeneous set of pathways. The Foldon Hypothesis is based on the concept of a defined pathway. According to the Foldon Hypothesis, protein folding is characterized by the stepwise assembly of small, cooperative units called foldons. The Maximum Caliber (Max Cal) method provides an opportunity to test this model. The Max Cal method gives the probabilities for dynamical trajectories, in much the same way that the maximum entropy principle gives the probabilities for equilibrium states. In this study, the Max Cal method was applied to folding data for the protein cytochrome c (cyt c; Hu W, Kan ZY, Mayne L, Englander SW. Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2016;113:3809-3814). The overall picture to emerge from this analysis is that the data do not require a dominant, defined pathway. The folding of cytochrome c is likely a heterogeneous process that includes multiple pathways."

This study assessed the effect of reduced emissions during the lockdown period, due to COVID-19, on air quality in three Italian cities, Florence, Pisa, and Lucca. For this study, we compared the concentration of particulate matter PM10, PM2.5, NO2, and O-3 measured during the lockdown period, with values obtained in the same period of 2019. Our results show no evidence of a direct relationship between the lockdown measures implemented and PM reduction in urban centers, except in areas with heavy traffic. Consistent with recently published studies, we did, however, observe a significant decrease in NO2 concentrations among all the air-monitoring stations for each city in this study. Finally, O-3 levels remained unchanged during the lockdown period. Of note, there were slight variations in the meteorological conditions for the same periods of different years. Our results suggest a need for further studies on the impact of vehicular traffic and industrial activities on PM air pollution, including adopting holistic source-control measures for improved air quality in urban environments."

Although the multimodality treatment (including orchiectomy, systemic chemotherapy, scrotal radiotherapy, and preventive central nervous system (CNS)-targeted treatment) is widely used to treat PTL, recurrence, especially CNS recurrence, occurred frequently. Patients with relapsed PTL have a dismal prognosis and limited treatment options. In this report, we described the case of a 63-year-old man with early-stage PTL. The patient received the multimodality treatment, but CNS relapse occurred 3 months following the front-line therapy. We gave him a combined chemo-free regimen treatment, including rituximab, ibrutinib, and lenalidomide (RIL), based on the tumor's gene mutation profile and the patient's preference. A complete response was achieved after the first cycle of treatment. Whole-brain radiotherapy was delivered as consolidative treatment following three more cycles of RIL. Thereafter, ibrutinib and lenalidomide continued as maintenance treatment. As of the submission of this manuscript, the response has lasted for more than 16 months. Based on the case, we believe chemo-free regimen RIL might be a favorable approach for PTL patients with CNS relapse, especially those frail elderly patients, when alternative treatments are not available."
1373,A new grading system for evaluating China's cultivated land quality,"Liu, Liming; Zhou, De; Chang, Xiao; Lin, Zhulu","Cultivated land is crucial to food security, social and economic stability, environmental quality, and sustainable urban-rural development in China and around the world. However, most of the current grading systems for evaluating cultivated land quality in China tend to generate homogeneous results and inadequate spatial descriptions mainly due to the use of a composite index method that often fails to recognize the matching relationship between land use needs and the quality of cultivated land. The purpose of this study is to propose a new grading system for evaluating China's cultivated land quality that involves two index systems and a scoring and grading scheme. In the proposed system, cultivated land quality is redefined in terms of production capacity quality and environmental quality, and the minimum limiting factor method and the weighted linear model are coupled for factor scoring and grading. The new system is demonstrated by a case-study in Yimen Town, a loess plateau region in western China's Shaanxi Province. The results of this study clearly indicate that the new grading system is superior to the current system when compared using two methods: the spatial pattern comparison method and the crop performance validation method. The results are also favorable in terms of matching relationships between the subclasses of cultivated land quality versus soil types and landforms. The new grading system not only helps to better understand the cultivated land quality but also provides a clear direction for science-based remediation and amelioration of cultivated land."
1374,"Mapping ecosystem services bundles for analyzing spatial trade-offs in inner Mongolia, China","Dou, Huashun; Li, Xiaobing; Li, Shengkun; Dang, Dongliang; Li, Xiang; Lyu, Xin; Li, Mengyuan; Liu, Siyu","Managing multiple ecosystem services (ESs) to facilitate synergy benefits is a crucial but challenging task for sustainable development, especially in arid and semi-arid regions. In this paper, the Inner Mongolia was used as a case study to systematically analyze the spatial trade-offs and synergies between 12 ESs consisting of 88 counties using the framework of ecosystem service bundle. We mapped ES distribution and then analyzed the relationships between ESs using Spearman correlation and hotspot/coldspot overlay analysis. In addition, ES bundles were identified using a self-organizing mapping network and the socio-ecological variables that drive the different ESs were explored using redundancy analysis. The results revealed complex spatial interactions between various ESs in Inner Mongolia due to water limitations. ES distribution and ES relationships correlated with gradients in biophysical and socioeconomic factors such as slope, precipitation, temperature, soil properties, and population density, and formed five types of ES bundles. These findings not only promote a clear understanding of the complex relationships among regional ESs, but lay a foundation for exploring win-win management strategies of ecological conservation and social-economic development in arid and semi-arid regions.

This paper does not find that comprehensive FDI quality has a significant impact on China's high-quality economic development. The further study sample is divided into three texts in the East and West, and found that the export capacity of the eastern provinces of FDI significantly promote high-quality economic development in the region; the technical level of the central provinces of FDI significantly promotes high-quality economic development in the region, but then the actual size of the FDI has a significant inhibitory effect on central provinces."
1376,How does high-speed railway affect green innovation efficiency? A perspective of innovation factor mobility,"Huang, Yue; Wang, Yebin","Growth effects of high-speed railway (HSR) have received increasing attention from scholars. However, little attention has been paid to HSR's effect on green innovation. To bridge this gap, using the difference in differences method, this paper aims to provide insights on how HSR affects green innovation from the perspective of innovation factor mobility, by employing the 108 cities in the Yangtze River Economic Belt of China in 2005-2016. The main findings are as follows: (1) Although the effects derived from HSR are heterogeneous, HSR significantly drives green innovation efficiency by 11.3%, which reveals that HSR is a critical variable for understanding the growth of green innovation. (2) This paper presents evidence that HSR promotes the mobility of innovative factors and then contributes to green innovation efficiency, based on which heterogeneity is explored. (3) HSR's effect on green innovation efficiency has a dynamic experience over time and shows an inverted U-shaped curve characterized by ""increased first and then decreased,"" which peaks in the 5th or 6th year. (4) Green innovation growth effects of HSR have spatial proximity: for every 1% increase in distance, the green innovation effect decreases by 0.0061%-0.0124%. A farther distance to an HSR station induces a lower growth effect. (5) This paper concludes with recommendations to improve green innovation through HSR construct and innovative factor mobility."
1377,The psychological role of music and attentional control for religious experiences in worship,"Yoshija Walter,Andreas Altorfer,Yoshija Walter,Andreas Altorfer","This study investigated the psychological dynamics during worship experiences under the influence of different music conditions. In total, 60 believers were recruited to participate in experiments where they were asked to engage in worship and to connect with God while continuously ranking how strongly they sensed the presence of the divine. After each condition, they were asked to rate how well they were able to focus on God during the worship procedure. Based on a previously published Feedback Loop Model that portrays global psychological mechanisms in worship, we deduced two hypotheses: (1) the ability to focus on God is positively associated with how strong the subjective religious experience becomes, and (2) the different musical conditions yield varying degrees in the intensity of the felt presence of God. Our statistical analyses on the current sample demonstrate that both alternative hypotheses can be accepted. For the latter thesis, two further assumptions were at play: (1) we speculated that religious worship songs were associated with stronger divine experiences than with secular ones, and (2) it was assumed that if they could worship to their own selection of songs, the experience would be more powerful than with the ones that were provided by the research team. Whereas upon our investigation the former assumption can be deemed correct, the latter shows a positive but insignificant association."
1378,Remanufacturing for the circular economy: Study and evaluation of critical factors,"Singhal, Deepak; Tripathy, Sushanta; Jena, Sarat Kumar","Remanufacturing is the vital component of the circular economy, which helps in harnessing the environmental, economic, and social benefits by extending the life cycle of end-of-life and end-of-use items. Remanufacturing is being practiced successfully in the developed states like the USA, UK, and Germany for various products while developing nations such as India, Brazil, and China are attempting to begin the remanufacturing on an enormous scale. This paper intends to identify and evaluate the critical factors which possess a significant influence on the remanufacturing. Authors have employed fuzzy DEMATEL method to establish the causal relationship among the critical factors and to determine the degree of importance of a factor. The results reveal that design for the manufacturing, collection strategy, management prescience, and purchase intention are the top factors which impact the remanufacturing most. Moreover, government policies, technology, sorting policies, and identity of the remanufacturer also possess a notable influence on the remanufacturing. It is also observed that design for remanufacturing and government regulations show the maximum number of relationships with other factors while inventory control and scheduling do not exhibit any relationships. Further, this paper provides valuable insights to the decision makers so that a firm may spearhead the remanufacturing business to maintain the circularity in the economy."
1379,"Energy, exergy, environmental and economic comparison of various solar thermal systems using water and Thermia Oil B base fluids, and CuO and Al2O3 nanofluids","Huang, Weibiao; Marefati, Mohammad","Recently, the use of solar thermal collectors has increased significantly. In the present work, energy, exergy, enviroeconomic and exergoeconomic analyses of various solar thermal collectors are investigated. These solar thermal collectors include flat-plate solar collector, linear Fresnel solar reflector, parabolic trough solar collector and solar parabolic dish collector. To examine the performance of these solar collectors two different working fluids, i.e. water and Thermia Oil B are considered. Furthermore, evaluation of the performance of solar collectors using nanofluids consisting of Al2O3 and CuO nanoparticles is presented. Also, in this paper, parameters such as exergy destruction rate, entropy generation rate, Sustainability index and Levelized Cost of Electricity for solar collectors are discussed. The performance of solar collectors in two different cities located in Iran (Tehran and Tabriz) is discussed for two different days (a winter day (2-Feb) and a summer day (14-Jun)). MATLAB software is used for mathematical modeling of solar thermal collectors. The results revealed that, the best and weakest performance from energy and energy points of view in all cases are related to the dish collector and flat-plate collector, respectively. Furthermore, the obtained results of the use of nanofluids as well as economic analysis may present new insights to the operation and development of such solar thermal systems. (C) 2020 The Authors.

1380,Assessing the energy dynamics of Pakistan: Prospects of biomass energy,"Irfan, Muhammad; Zhao, Zhen-Yu; Panjwani, Manoj Kumar; Mangi, Fareed Hussain; Li, Heng; Jan, Ali; Ahmad, Munir; Rehman, Abdul","The energy needs of Pakistan have increased many folds in recent years due to improved lifestyle, ever-increasing population, and economic development. Biomass energy has emerged as a promising renewable energy source and has an enormous potential to fulfill the energy requirements of the country. This paper aims to assess the current situation and future projections of electricity generation by using biomass energy resources. For this purpose, we critically reviewed extensive literature i.e., research papers, energy reports, official statistical data, relevant regulations, and government policies. Research findings reveal that the abundant biomass resources of the country include fuelwood, agricultural residues, animal dung, and municipal solid waste. 48% of the domestic energy needs are being fulfilled from fuelwood, while another 32% by crop and animal residues. 85 sugar industries of the country produce enough bagasse to generate 5800 GWh of electricity. Corn stalk, sugarcane trash, rice straw, wheat straw, and cotton stalks are the major crop residues having a production of 6.43, 8.94, 17.86, 35.6, and 50.6 Mt, respectively. The power generation potential from animal dung is 4800-5600 MW. Similarly, the electricity generation potential of municipal solid waste by thermochemical and biochemical conversion is 560 kWh/t and 220 kWh/t, respectively. As envisioned by the Pakistani government to enhance the share of renewables in the total energy mix of the country from 1.1% to 5% by 2030, biomass energy has high prospects to achieve this target.

1381,A techno-economic sizing method for grid-connected household photovoltaic battery systems,"Zhang, Yijie; Ma, Tao; Campana, Pietro Elia; Yamaguchi, Yohei; Dai, Yanjun","Battery storage provides an effective solution to alleviate the burden of the intermittent photovoltaic production on the grid and increase photovoltaic penetration in residential houses. Despite several existing work dedicated to the evaluation of photovoltaic battery system, the research on system sizing and operation strategy of the household system still has substantial areas to be explored such as techno-economic analysis under different electricity tariffs and comprehensive parametric analyses. In this paper, the mathematical model of a photovoltaic battery system is developed to investigate system performance, based on the various economic and technical indicators. This study demonstrates that the integration of battery energy storage could increase the value of self-consumption and self-sufficiency rates while making payback period longer. Substantial photovoltaic battery systems have been simulated under practical dynamic electricity tariffs in a typical electricity market. Eight cases with different technical performances from the recommended reference combinations are compared and studied in detail. The energy flows among photovoltaic, battery bank, grid and household user are discussed, revealing that systems with high self-sufficiency rate lead to more schedulable photovoltaic production, sold electricity and lower battery usage rate than those with high self-consumption rate. Besides, the entire lifecycle economic analysis indicates that a higher self-sufficiency rate refers to higher initial investment but shorter payback period and larger profit. The revenues breakdown of the cases shows that subsidies have a significant impact, especially for cases with high self-sufficiency rate. The levelized cost of electricity of photovoltaic and photovoltaic battery systems ranges from 0.373 to 0.628 CNY/kWh, demonstrating the possibility of partial grid parity under the current situation in Shanghai."
1382,Industry 4.0 and circular economy: Operational excellence for sustainable reverse supply chain performance,"Dev, Navin K.; Shankar, Ravi; Qaiser, Fahham Hasan","The present research proposes a roadmap to the excellence of operations for sustainable reverse supply chain/logistics by the joint implementation of principles of Industry 4.0 (I4.0) and ReSOLVE model of circular economy (CE) approaches. The connection between I4.0 and CE is unveiled by addressing the case-based model affecting the economic and environmental performances imparting two important dimensions: (i) the information sharing with the reverse logistics system is in real-time mode, and (ii) diffusion of green product in the market. The effectiveness of the virtual world in I4.0 environment is explored using simulation of reverse logistics model involving operations such as inventory and production planning policy, family-based dispatching rules of remanufacturing, and additive manufacturing. The remanufacturing model examines the trade-off between set-up delays and the availability of green transportation. For managerial insights, Taguchi experimental design framework has been used for the analysis. Based on the trade-off analysis between environmental and economic performances, the findings of the paper suggest appropriate combinations of information-sharing and family-based dispatching rules. Further, the findings suggest that, given the I4.0 and circular capabilities, it is necessary to focus on the cost of the socially influenced operations involving factors such as collection investment and size of the end-user market that governs the product returns. Therefore, in the present paper, the integration of I4.0 and CE represents a real-time decision model for the sustainable reverse logistics system."

This prospective cohort study included 112 pregnant women (with and without SGA, n = 56 each). Maternal serum samples were collected at 10-14 gestational weeks to quantify the levels of cortisol and its precursors and metabolites by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Increased maternal serum levels of tetrahydrocortisol (11.82 ± 8.16 ng/mL vs. 7.51 ± 2.90 ng/mL, P < 0.005) and decreased 21-deoxycortisol (2.98 ± 1.36 ng/mL vs. 4.33 ± 2.06 ng/mL, P < 0.0001) were observed in pregnant women carrying SGA fetus. In conjunction with individual steroid levels, metabolic ratios corresponding to the activity of related enzymes were calculated. In addition to increased tetrahydrocortisol/cortisol ratio (P < 0.006), the SGA group showed a significant increase in the two metabolic ratios including cortisol/11-deoxycortisol (P < 0.03) and cortisol/21-deoxycortisol (P < 0.0003). The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve generated in combination with three variables of 21-deoxycortisol concentration and two metabolic ratios of cortisol/21-deoxycortisol and tetrahydrocortisol/cortisol resulted in an area under the ROC curve = 0.824 (95% confidence interval, 0.713-0.918). A significant decrease in maternal serum levels of 21-deoxycortisol and an increase in two metabolic ratios of cortisol/21-deoxycortisol and tetrahydrocortisol/cortisol, indicating cortisol biosynthetic rate, represent potential biomarkers for the prediction of SGA in the first trimester."
1384,Phlegmonous gastritis in 2 yearling horses,"Julie B Engiles,Francisco A Uzal,Mauricio A Navarro,Virginia B Reef,Susan J Bender,Julie B Engiles,Francisco A Uzal,Mauricio A Navarro,Virginia B Reef,Susan J Bender","Phlegmonous gastritis was diagnosed in 2 yearling fillies that were presented with a 1-wk history of fever, lethargy, and hypoproteinemia, associated with a previous diagnosis of equine proliferative enteropathy based on clinical signs and PCR assay detection of Lawsonia intracellularis in fecal samples. Abdominal ultrasound revealed enlargement of the stomach and expansion of its submucosal layer with hypoechoic fluid, as well as thickened hypomotile small intestinal segments. Given the poor prognosis and poor response to treatment, both horses were euthanized, one on the day of presentation and the other after 3 wk of intensive medical management including a combination of antimicrobials, analgesics, and intravenous colloids. At autopsy, acute mural gastritis characterized by severe submucosal edema with suppurative inflammation (i.e., phlegmonous gastritis) and necroulcerative enteritis compatible with the necrotizing form of equine proliferative enteropathy were identified in both horses. The gastric inflammation was associated with thrombosis and mixed bacterial populations, including Clostridium perfringens, that were confined to the submucosa without evidence of mucosal involvement; toxin genes compatible with C. perfringens type C were identified in one case. Human phlegmonous gastritis is an uncommon, often-fatal pyogenic infection that is often associated with mucosal injury, bacteremia, or immunocompromise. Our finding of this unusual gastric lesion in 2 horses with similar signalment, clinical disease, and spectrum of postmortem lesions suggests a similar etiopathogenesis that possibly involves local, regional, or distant hematogenous origin, and should be considered a potential complication of gastrointestinal mucosal compromise in horses."
1385,Acute peri-operative neurocognitive disorders: a narrative review,"L Evered,K Atkins,B Silbert,D A Scott,L Evered,K Atkins,B Silbert,D A Scott","Peri-operative neurocognitive disorders are the most common complication experienced by older individuals undergoing anaesthesia and surgery. Peri-operative neurocognitive disorders, particularly postoperative delirium, result in long-term poor outcomes including: death; dementia; loss of independence; and poor cognitive and functional outcomes. Recent changes to the nomenclature of these disorders aims to align peri-operative neurocognitive disorders with cognitive disorders in the community, with consistent definitions and clinical diagnosis. Possible mechanisms include: undiagnosed neurodegenerative disease; inflammation and resulting neuroinflammation; neuronal damage; and comorbid systemic disease. Pre-operative frailty represents a significant risk for poor postoperative outcomes; it is associated with an increase in the incidence of cognitive decline at 3 and 12 months postoperatively. In addition to cognitive decline, frailty is associated with poor functional outcomes following elective non-cardiac surgery. It was recently shown that 29% of frail patients died or experienced institutionalisation or new disability within 90 days of major elective surgery. Identification of vulnerable patients before undergoing surgery and anaesthesia is the key to preventing peri-operative neurocognitive disorders. Current approaches include: pre-operative delirium and cognitive screening; blood biomarker analysis; intra-operative management that may reduce the incidence of postoperative delirium such as lighter anaesthesia using processed electroencephalography devices; and introduction of guidelines which may reduce or prevent delirium and postoperative neurocognitive disorders. This review will address these issues and advocate for an approach to care for older peri-operative patients which starts in the community and continues throughout the pre-operative, intra-operative, postoperative and post-discharge phases of care management, involving multidisciplinary medical teams, as well as family and caregivers wherever possible."
1386,"""New White Ethnics"" or ""New Latinos""?: Hispanic/Latino Pan-Ethnicity and Ancestry Reporting among South American Immigrants to the United States","Rebecca A Schut,Rebecca A Schut","This article explores the identification patterns of South American immigrants to the United States, as measured via Hispanic/Latino ethnicity and ancestry reporting on the US Census. Using data from the 2006-2010 and 2011-2015 American Community Survey, my analysis reveals four main findings. First, I show significant heterogeneity in identity patterns and in sociodemographic, immigration, and geographic characteristics between South American and Mexican immigrants in the United States. Second, I find that Southern Cone immigrants do not report Hispanic/Latino ethnicity and ""birth-country"" ancestry (ancestry that is concordant with birth country, such as Colombian or Chilean) to a greater extent than Andean immigrants, in favor of reporting more distal ""ancestral-origin"" ancestries (i.e., Spanish, Japanese, etc.). Third, I show that those immigrants who do report Hispanic/Latino ethnicity are more likely to report ""birth-country"" ancestry than ""ancestral-origin"" ancestry, net of other factors. Finally, my analysis demonstrates that Brazilian immigrants chart a different path of identification among South American immigrants and almost unanimously do not report Hispanic/Latino ethnicity while overwhelmingly reporting ""Brazilian"" ancestry. Taken together, variation in Hispanic/Latino ethnicity and ancestry reporting across South American immigrant groups has implications for their incorporation into US society, as well as for the degree to which these immigrants see themselves as racialized actors in the United States. Some South American immigrant groups (Southern Cone immigrants) appear to be incorporating as ""New White ethnics,"" and others (Andean immigrants) appear to be incorporating as ""New Latinos."" Researchers of international migration should carefully consider these identification differences and their implications for the measurement and study of ""Hispanic/Latino"" immigrants and their descendants in the United States."
1387,A review on experimental and numerical investigations of cortical bone fracture,"Ajay Kumar,Rajesh Ghosh,Ajay Kumar,Rajesh Ghosh","This paper comprehensively reviews the various experimental and numerical techniques, which were considered to determine the fracture characteristics of the cortical bone. This study also provides some recommendations along with the critical review, which would be beneficial for future research of fracture analysis of cortical bone. Cortical bone fractures due to sports activities, climbing, running, and engagement in transport or industrial accidents. Individuals having different diseases are also at high risk of cortical bone fracture. It has been observed that osteon orientation influences cortical bone fracture toughness and fracture mechanisms. Apart from this, recent studies indicate that fracture parameters of cortical bone also depend on many factors such as age, sex, temperature, osteoporosis, orientation, location, loading condition, strain rate, and storage facility, etc. The cortical bone regains its fracture toughness due to various toughening mechanisms. Owing to these factors, several experimental, clinical, and numerical investigations have been carried out to determine the fracture parameters of the cortical bone. Cortical bone is the dense outer surface of the bone and contributes to 80%-82% of the skeleton mass. Cortical bone experiences load far exceeding body weight due to muscle contraction and the dynamics of motion. It is very important to know the fracture pattern, direction of fracture, location of the fracture, and toughening mechanism of cortical bone. A basic understanding of the different factors that affect the fracture parameters and fracture mechanisms of the cortical bone is necessary to prevent the failure and fracture of cortical bone. This review has summarized the advancement considered in the various experimental techniques and numerical methods to get complete information about the fracture mechanisms of cortical bone."
1388,"Fiscal decentralization, environmental regulation, and pollution: a spatial investigation","Chen, Xia; Chang, Chun-Ping","To investigate the effects of regulation on environmental pollution under Chinese-style fiscal decentralization, this research analyzes annual data over the period 2003 to 2017 covering 30 provinces in China with the spatial economic model. The empirical results show significant spatial agglomeration effects on the emissions of wastewater, sulfur dioxide, and solid waste. Environmental regulation helps reduce discharge of wastewater and solid waste, but does not help reduce the emission of sulfur dioxide; because there is significantly positive externality in treating pollutants with high fluidity, cost is larger than revenue for local governments. The relationship between fiscal decentralization and pollutants shapes an inverted U-shaped curve. We finally offer some implications in accordance with our empirical finding, such as the intensity of environmental regulation should be suitable for economic development, different measures should be taken based on the fluidity of pollutants, and a new evaluation system should be established."
1389,"Techno-economic analysis of a hybrid power system based on the cost-effective hydrogen production method for rural electrification, a case study in Iran","Rad, Mohammad Amin Vaziri; Ghasempour, Roghaye; Rahdan, Parisa; Mousavi, Soroush; Arastounia, Mehrdad","Rural electrification challenges in Iran are the most important obstacle to achieve electricity access for the entire population. The current study focuses on finding an optimal renewable energy system to meet the load of a small village by renewable resources. This village faces frequent power outages, common in many far-off villages in Iran. A hybrid photovoltaics/wind turbine/biogas generator/fuel cell renewable energy system is proposed and analyzed for both stand-alone and on-grid application. Fuel cells are used alongside a hydrogen tank, batteries, and a reformer or an electrolyzer, to act as storage devices and backup component. The main goal is to find an optimal configuration that can meet the electricity demand and be satisfactory from both an economic and environmental point of view. The results indicated that using solar, wind and biogas is the most affordable method and that adding fuel cell to this configuration would increase costs by 33-37%, but also improve system flexibility. Using a reformer is more efficient and about 6% less costly, but also creates more pollution. The cost of energy for a stand-alone system with reformer was calculated to be 0.164 to 0.233 $/kWh, while the on-grid system cost of energy was 0.096-0.125 $/kWh. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

1390,Assessing changes to adolescent health-promoting behaviors following the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic: A multi-methods exploration of the role of within-person combinations of trait perfectionism,"Melissa Blackburn,Tabitha Methot-Jones,Danielle S Molnar,Dawn Zinga,Natalie Spadafora,Natalie Tacuri,Melissa Blackburn,Tabitha Methot-Jones,Danielle S Molnar,Dawn Zinga,Natalie Spadafora,Natalie Tacuri","The current work provides a multi-methods exploration of how within-person subtypes of self-oriented perfectionism (SOP) and socially prescribed perfectionism (SPP) were related to shifts in health-promoting behaviors among adolescents following the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Study One tested the 2 × 2 and tripartite models of perfectionism through a quantitative test of how such subtypes predicted changes in health behaviors pre-pandemic to intra-pandemic among 202 adolescents (M = 17.86, SD = 1.421). Results indicated that the combination of high SOP/high SPP was linked to the most maladaptive changes to health-promoting behaviors, supporting the tripartite model. Study Two aimed to contextualize these findings by analyzing semi-structured interviews with 31 adolescent self-identified perfectionists (M = 15.97, SD = 1.991) during the initial lockdown mandate. Results indicated that participants experienced a welcome break and found more time to engage in health-promoting behaviors. However, those high in SOP - regardless of their level of SPP - had more difficulty relaxing due to a resistance to relenting their perfectionistic standards. Altogether, these findings support the exacerbating role of SOP when combined with SPP posited by the tripartite model of perfectionism with respect to adolescents' health-promoting behaviors during the COVID-19 pandemic."

As a potential alternative, fibers derived from cellulose-based materials offer renewability, biocompatibility, and biodegradability. In the present work, we studied the potential of carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) to prepare optical fibers with a core-only architecture. Wet-spun CMC hydrogel filaments were cross-linked using aluminum ions to fabricate optical fibers. The transmission spectra of fibers suggest that the light transmission window for cladding-free CMC fibers was in the range of 550-1350 nm, wherein the attenuation coefficient for CMC fibers was measured to be 1.6 dB·cm-1 at 637 nm. CMC optical fibers were successfully applied in touch sensing and respiratory rate monitoring. Finally, as a proof-of-concept, we demonstrate high-speed (150 Mbit/s) short-distance signal transmission using CMC fibers (at 1310 nm) in both air and water media. Our results establish the potential of carboxymethyl cellulose-based biocompatible optical fibers for highly demanding advanced sensor applications, such as in the biomedical domain."

The aim of present study was to assess the multi-functional potential of five LAB strains isolated from giant panda. In this study, we analyzed five giant panda LAB strains (Weissella confuse WJ202003 (W3), WJ202009 (W9), WJ202021 (W21), BSP201703 (X3); Lactiplantibacillus plantarum BSGP201683 (G83)) and found that they exhibited rapid growth as well as strong acid production capacity. The five LAB strains possessed high cell surface hydrophobicity to the four tested solvents (xylene, hexadecane, chloroform, ethyl acetate; except strain W9), auto-aggregation ability, co-aggregation ability with three pathogens (Escherichia coli, Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli, Salmonella), adhesion ability to Caco-2 cell line, and strongly biofilm formation ability, suggesting an adhesion property. As investigated for their antioxidative potential, all the strains showed good tolerance to H2O2, high scavenging ability against 1, 1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), and hydroxyl (OH-), and reduction ability. Furthermore, the five LAB strains could produce multiple probiotic substances, including exopolysaccharide (EPS), gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), bile salt hydrolase (BSH), cellulase (only strain G83), and protease (except strain X3), which was the first to report the production of EPS, GABA, BSH, cellulase, and protease in giant panda-derived LAB strain. These results demonstrated that strains W3, W9, W21, X3, and G83 had multi-functional potential and could be utilized as potential probiotics for giant panda."

The patient was taken to the operating room for evacuation of hemothorax, and samples and biopsy specimens were taken for cytologic and pathologic examination. Final report with immunohistochemical staining showed a high-grade MFS. After the procedure, there was clinical and radiological improvement, and the patient was followed up as an outpatient. Myxofibrosarcoma is a very rare and aggressive connective tissue neoplasm with variable presentations. Surgical resection is the preferred treatment. Prompt diagnosis and adequate management of these tumors are important to reduce their high local recurrence and distant metastasis rates. Therefore, it is important to be aware of its common and uncommon presentations."

But social networking sites (SNSs) like WeChat have emerged as alternative contexts where people can maintain self and obtain gratification, despite the disclosure of self to others often being a challenging issue. To examine the effect of personality factors on people's self-disclosure on SNSs, we develop a model based on the time perspective theory and the socioemotional selectivity theory. We suggest that people's narcissism traits and two types of time perspective (i.e. future and present-hedonistic) have positive effects on their self-disclosure. In addition, we propose that virtual presence and hedonic gratification mediate the effects of both future time perspective and present-hedonistic time perspective. We obtain a sample of 516 WeChat users in China and take ex-ante and post-hoc measures to deal with common method variance. By means of partial least squares-structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM) methods, we validate both our measurement model and the structural model, so we confirm all the hypothesized causal paths in the proposed model. Our study broadens the boundaries of the time perspective theory and the socioemotional selectivity theory, and offers new insights for addressing some of the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic."

The objective of the study was to develop and validate nanoemulsion (NE) based in-situ gel of CZP for intranasal administration as an approach for bioavailability enhancement. Solubility of CZP was initially investigated in different oils, surfactants and co-surfactants, then pseudoternary phase diagrams were constructed to select the optimized ratio of oil, surfactant and co-surfactant. Clear and transparent NE formulations were characterized in terms of droplet size, viscosity, solubilization capacity, transmission electron microscopy, in-vitro drug release and compatibility studies. Selected NEs were incorporated into different in-situ gel bases using combination of two thermosensitive polymers; Pluronic® F-127 (PF127) and F-68 (PF68). NE-based gels (NG) were investigated for gelation temperature, viscosity, gel strength, spreadability and stability. Moreover, selected NGs were evaluated for ex-vivo permeation, mucoadhesive strength and nasal ciliotoxicity. Peppermint oil, tween 80 and transcutol P were chosen for NE preparation owing to their maximum CZP solubilization. Clear NE points extrapolated from tween 80:transcutol P (1:1) phase diagram and passed dispersibility and stability tests, demonstrated globule size of 67.99 to 354.96 nm and zeta potential of -12.4 to -3.11 mV with enhanced in-vitro CZP release (>90% in some formulations). After incorporation of the selected N3 and N9 formulations of oil:Smix of 1:7 and 2:7, respectively to a mixture of PF127 and PF68 (20:2% w/w), the resultant NG formulations exhibited optimum gelation temperature and viscosity with enhanced CZP permeation and retention through sheep nasal mucosa. Ciliotoxicity examinations of the optimum NGs displayed no inflammation or damage of the lining epithelium and the underlying cells of the nasal mucosa. In conclusion, NE-based gels may be a promising dosage form of CZP for schizophrenia treatment."

In contrast to normal skin or hypertrophic scars, keloid tissue extends beyond the initial site of injury. Patients may complain of pain, itching, or burning. Although multiple treatments exist, none is uniformly successful. Genetic advances have made it possible to explore differences in gene expression between keloids and normal skin. Identifying the biomarker for keloid is beneficial to the mechanism exploration and treatment development of keloid. In this study, we identified seven genes with significant differences in keloids through weighted gene co-expression network analysis(WGCNA) and differential expression analysis. Then, by the Lasso regression, we constructed a keloid diagnostic model using five of these genes. Further studies found that keloids could be divided into high-risk and low-risk groups by this model, with differences in immunity, m6A methylation, and pyroptosis. Finally, we verified the accuracy of the diagnostic model in clinical RNA-sequencing data."

Twelve semi-professional high-level and fifteen amateur soccer male players (23.9 ± 3.6 years) performed three HT attempts, and kinematic data were recorded with MOB and MOCAP. Intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) and coefficient of variation (CV) were used as measures of intra-session reliability. T-test with Cohen's effect size (ES), Pearson's product moment and Bland-Altman analysis were used to obtain MOB validity. Regarding intra-session reliability, the CV was 1.13%, and ICC was 0.98, considered acceptable. Respecting validity criteria did not reveal significant differences (p < 0.05; effect size = 0.06, considered trivial), 'almost perfect' correlation (Pearson) (r = 0.98; p < 0.05), and strong agreement were obtained between MOB and MOCAP. This finding showed a test (HT) with a specific character, using cost-effective instrument and applicable to all soccer fields (adjusted to the standardised lines in the soccer field), all of them backed-up by reliability, usefulness and validity criteria."

Based on the balanced panel data of 285 cities in China from 2005 to 2017, this paper analyzes the impact of financial agglomeration on energy efficiency. Theoretical analysis shows that financial agglomeration can influence energy efficiency through scale economy effect, innovation driving effect, information spillover effect and structural adjustment effect. Dynamic spatial econometric results show that, from a national perspective, financial agglomeration has a positive impact on energy efficiency. However, from the perspective of different regions and different city sizes, it is found that financial agglomeration can have different effects on energy efficiency. Financial agglomeration has a significant positive impact on energy efficiency in eastern and central regions, megacities and big cities. Financial agglomeration has a significant negative impact on energy efficiency in western China, and has no significant effect on energy efficiency in medium-sized and small cities. Finally, based on the conclusions of the study, specific proposals for financial agglomeration to improve energy efficiency are proposed."
1399,The relationship between energy consumption and fiscal decentralization and the importance of urbanization: Evidence from Chinese provinces,"Elheddad, Mohamed; Djellouli, Nassima; Tiwari, Aviral Kumar; Hammoudeh, Shawkat","This study examines the provincial impact of fiscal decentralization, in the form of shifting fiscal responsibilities of expenditures and revenues and others from the central government to lower local governments, as well as rapidly rising urbanization, on energy consumption for 31 Chinese provinces subject to relevant important control variables over the period 2006 to 2015. This analysis has implications for economic growth, efficiency and equality in China. To this end, the study employs multiple panel data analyses and panel quantile regressions to analyse this impact. Our findings show that fiscal decentralization has a non-linear relationship with energy consumption, which confirms the concave behaviour of fiscal decentralization in the Chinese provinces and underscores the validity of the environmental Kuznets curve hypothesis in those provinces, given the control variables. Moreover, increasing Chinese urbanization leads to high demand for energy consumption. Provincial governments can support eco-innovation and eco-investment by pursuing green growth strategies such as the expansion of the service sector and the boosting of the renewable energy sector: particularly when taking into account that coal, at one end of the spectrum, generates a 20 times greater carbon impact than renewables at the other."
1400,Hybrid photovoltaic and wind mini-grids in Kenya: Techno-economic assessment and barriers to diffusion,"Johannsen, Rasmus Magni; Ostergaard, Poul Alberg; Hanlin, Rebecca","Mini-grids have been widely developed for rural electrification purposes in Kenya, predominantly as systems combining photovoltaic modules (PV), a diesel generator, and battery capacity. (Small) wind turbines have been largely neglected in such setups and are basically non-existent in Kenyan mini-grids despite potential complementarity with PV due to different temporal production profiles of PV and wind power. This study investigates why small wind turbines have largely been omitted from Kenyan mini-grids from both a techno-economic and diffusion theoretical perspective. A techno-economic model is used for backtesting the feasibility of a hybrid PV/wind system, and building upon theories of innovation and diffusion of technology a conceptual framework is developed and applied for assessing the state of the Kenyan mini-grid sector and categorizing identified barriers accordingly. The article thus suggest an interdisciplinary approach to investigating the potential role of small wind power in energy systems transitioning towards renewables. The techno-economic modelling shows that PV/wind hybrids have both technical and economic potential at average wind speeds above 4.5 m/s but little relevance below. Comprehensive barriers within the technical, economic and systemic spheres are encountered by established stakeholders of the Kenyan mini-grid sector, severely hindering diffusion of hybrid PV/wind solutions.

1401,Multicriteria analysis of seawater electrolysis technologies for green hydrogen production at sea,"d'Amore-Domenech, Rafael; Santiago, Oscar; Leo, Teresa J.","The production of green hydrogen through the electrolysis of seawater using marine renewable energies offer numerous advantages. Nonetheless, the combination of marine renewables and electrolysis technologies has not reached commercial status yet. This study aims to see which electrolysis technology presents the best prospects of applicability in the short term by conducting a multicriteria comparison, where economic, environmental and social factors have been selected. Due to the different nature of the involved factors, the analysis is inherently complex. For its simplification, multicriteria decision-making methods are used. However, such methods could lead to various types of inconsistencies, and in order to avoid them, five distinct multicriteria decision-making methods have been employed. This combination enables checking the ranking consistency and its robustness, conferring the results a higher reliability. The results of the study reveal that Proton Exchange Membrane Electrolysis at sea presents the best prospects of applicability in the short term."
1402,Exclusive Enteral Nutrition in Adult Crohn's Disease: an Overview of Clinical Practice and Perceived Barriers,"Roberto de Sire,Olga Maria Nardone,Anna Testa,Giulio Calabrese,Anna Caiazzo,Fabiana Castiglione,Roberto de Sire,Olga Maria Nardone,Anna Testa,Giulio Calabrese,Anna Caiazzo,Fabiana Castiglione","Recently, the role of nutrition in the management of Crohn's disease (CD) is of increasing interest and the exploration of novel nutritional interventions to improve long-term management of the disease is challenging. So far, the majority of the studies on the role of exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN) in CD are conducted in the pediatric population and have highlighted the efficacy of EEN for achieving mucosal healing. This implicates that a similar approach would be beneficial in adult patients. However, the evidence for EEN in adults is heterogeneous, with meta-analyses reporting it as inferior to steroids while growing data demonstrate improvement in complicated CD. Currently, EEN is less used in adult patients with IBD. Indeed, the lack of palatability of enteral formula leads to difficulties in acceptance and compliance. The search for more tolerable and still effective diets has become an intense area of research aiming to explore the potential role of diet to control inflammation in patients with CD. Thus, this narrative review provides the state-of-the-art on the use of EEN treatment in CD and highlights the perceived barriers to its implementation in adult CD patients."
1403,Investigating the barriers to building information modeling (BIM) implementation within the Nigerian construction industry,"Olanrewaju, Oludolapo Ibrahim; Chileshe, Nicholas; Babarinde, Sunday Ajiboye; Sandanayake, Malindu","Purpose The purpose of this paper is to identify and assess the perceptions of constructional professionals on barriers to implementation of building information modeling (BIM) within the Nigerian construction industry. Design/methodology/approach A scoping literature review was conducted to identify the fourteen barriers to implementation of BIM, which were employed to design a questionnaire survey. Data collected were analyzed using descriptive statistics, mean score, Kruskal-Wallis test, analysis of variance and multivariate techniques such as factor analysis. Findings The descriptive and empirical analysis demonstrated a disparity of ranking of the 14 barriers factors among the groups; however no statistically significant differences among the 14 barriers to BIM. Based on the mean score ranking results, only three (out of 14) barriers are identified as critical (mean score greater than 3.5): few studies available on BIM and lack of knowledge, inexistence or inadequate government policies, and high cost of implementation. The results of the one-sample t-tests show that they were statistically significant differences in 10 out of 14 barriers as follows: few studies available on BIM and lack of knowledge, lack of demand for use and acceptance of BIM, inadequate contractual coordination, lack of specified standards, cost of data and information sharing, technological availability issues, reluctance of other stakeholders, business and cultural changes, data and intellectual property issues, and interoperability issues. The study, through factor analysis, categorized the fourteen barriers to BIM implementation into four principal factors. The factors are: technology and business-related barriers; training and people-related barriers; cost and standards-related barriers; and process and economic-related barriers. Practical implications The identification and assessment of the key barriers to BIM implementation would be useful for the construction professionals and other stakeholder of the construction industry with the view to advance BIM adoption in Nigeria. This could also be extended to other developing countries through considerations of the local economic conditions, given the status of BIM as being in the germinating stage of development in Africa. Originality/value The study provides insights on the barriers to BIM implementation across the Nigerian construction sector environments. The innovative aspect of the study is the identification of the ordered and grouped (composite) set of barriers to BIM which could be used to developing appropriate mitigating solutions."

The survey demonstrates that there exist an immense potential in the AI assisted chatbot system for providing customer services and providing better governance in public administration services."
1405,Effective municipal solid waste management capability under uncertainty in Vietnam: Utilizing economic efficiency and technology to foster social mobilization and environmental integrity,"Bui, Tat-Dat; Tsai, Feng Ming; Tseng, Ming -Lang; Wu, Kuo-Jui; Chiu, Anthony S. F.","Resources and expertise for controlling processes are inadequate due to municipal solid waste management (MSWM) capability limitations in Vietnam. The resource-based view (RBV) needs to be considered in the assessment of municipal solid waste management. Nevertheless, in practice, various attributes of municipal solid waste management are not considered in the sustainable performance of cities. Hence, this study applied exploratory factor analysis (EFA) to confirm the validity and reliability of these attributes and construct a hierarchical structure. Fuzzy set theory was used to convert the linguistic preferences into crisp values and the decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL) method was used to assess the causal interrelationships among the attributes. The analytic network process (ANP) was adopted to construct the hierarchical framework, and fuzzy importance - performance analysis (IPA) was used to enhance our understanding of the gap between importance and performance. The results show that the efficiency and effectiveness of cities' waste management systems depend on the capability based on utilizing economic efficiency and technology advantages to foster social mobilization and environmental integrity. Practitioners should consider new data acquisition and communication technologies, the circular economy, technical capabilities, and organizational/leadership capabilities in their decision making to promote sustainable performance. To develop sustainable MSWM, suitable strategic solutions based on the resources and strengths of each city should be developed that consider formal, informal and small-scale sectors.

1406,How does green credit policy affect total factor productivity of the manufacturing firms in China? The mediating role of debt financing and the moderating role of environmental regulation,"Yanchao Feng,Zhou Liang,Yanchao Feng,Zhou Liang","Treating the green credit policy issued in 2012 as a quasi-natural experiment, this study has investigated the impact of green credit policy on total factor productivity of the manufacturing firms in China by using the panel data of the A-share firms listed on the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges during 2008 and 2020, with the consideration of the mediating role of debt financing and the moderating role of environmental regulation simultaneously. The results show that green credit policy has a negative effect on total factor productivity of the manufacturing firms in China. Empirical evidence also shows that debt financing could oppositely mediate the nexus between green credit policy and total factor productivity of the manufacturing firms in China by both inhibiting long-term loans and promoting short-term loans. In addition, the moderating role of environmental regulation is partially and conditionally established. Furthermore, the regional heterogeneity and the property rights heterogeneity are proved. Finally, conclusions and policy implications are provided to improve the quality of green credit policy in the future."

It further aligns with the 2030 United Nations Sustainable Development Goals and 11, which aim to ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages and make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable. It contributes to the health-environment literature by investigating the intrinsic relationships among mortality rates, carbon emissions (environmental degradation), and non-renewable energy consumption. The study uses an unbalanced sample of 42 Asia and Pacific countries to determine (1) whether carbon emissions exaggerate the incidence of mortality rates and (2) if the interaction of non-renewable energy with carbon emissions enhances or alters the impact of carbon emissions on mortality rates. Consistent findings from the panel spatial correlation consistent least-squares dummy variables (PSCC-LSDV) and two-step system generalized method of moments (GMM) techniques reveal that (i) carbon emissions exacerbate mortality rates; (ii) non-renewable energy consumption exhibit mortality-reducing properties; (iii) non-renewable energy attenuates the impact of carbon emissions on mortality rates, (iv) persistency in mortalities occurs; and (v) the health-environment-energy dynamics differ across income groups. The paper's conjecture is expected to channel a new line of discourse on how non-renewable energy influences the environment and health outcomes."
1408,Upstream Activation Sequence Can Function as an Insulator for Chromosomal Regulation of Heterologous Pathways Against Position Effects in Saccharomyces cerevisiae,"Buli Su,Fan Yang,Anzhang Li,Ming-Rong Deng,Honghui Zhu,Buli Su,Fan Yang,Anzhang Li,Ming-Rong Deng,Honghui Zhu","Metabolic engineering of microbial cell factories through integrating the heterologous synthetic pathway into the chromosome is most commonly used for industrial applications. However, the position of the foreign gene in the chromosome can affect its transcriptional level. As a microorganism that is generally regarded as safe (GRAS) and commonly applied in industrial manufacture with large-scale operations, Saccharomyces cerevisiae is also confronted with this position effect. In this study, we characterized 12 different chromosome sites by inserting the lycopene biosynthetic pathway as a reporter cassette. Due to the different integration loci, the gene transcription and lycopene yield exhibited more than 58-fold and 3.8-fold differences, respectively. Furthermore, changing the gene order also revealed a remarkable influence (30-fold and 14-fold) on gene transcription and lycopene yield. Besides, the upstream activation sequence of a strong promoter (defined as an insulator) in S. cerevisiae could reduce the impact by gene order, and increased the gene transcription (tenfold) and lycopene yield (sevenfold). Taken together, our results demonstrated that gene order and insulator affected gene transcription and heterogeneous biosynthesis, opening the opportunity to regulate gene transcription by insulator against position effect in S. cerevisiae."

Penicillins are produced by Penicillium rubens (popularly known as P. chrysogenum) were used to synthesize the active pharmaceutical intermediate (API), 6-aminopenicillinic acid (6-APA) employed in semisynthetic antibiotic production. The wild strains produce a negligible amount of penicillin (Pen). High antibiotic titre-producing P. chrysogenum strains are necessitating for industrial Pen production to meet global demand at lower prices. Classical strain improvement (CSI) approaches such as random mutagenesis, medium engineering, and fermentation are the cornerstones for high-titer Pen production. Since, Sir Alexander Fleming Discovery of Pen, great efforts are expanded to develop at a commercial scale antibiotics producing strains. Breakthroughs in genetic engineering, heterologous expression and CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing tools opened a new window for Pen production at a commercial scale to assure health crisis. The current state of knowledge, limitations of CSI and genetic engineering approaches to Pen production are discussed in this review."

On examination, there was facial dysmorphism, hypotonia, encephalopathy, joint laxity and muscle hypertrophy in addition to left foot talipes. On evaluation, there were renal cortical cysts, rhizomelia, chondrodysplasia punctata and elevated muscle enzymes, along with a dilated third ventricle. As the phenotype was not consistent with any of the muscular dystrophies or the peroxisomal disorders, an exome sequencing was requested. It revealed a combination of Zellweger syndrome and Ullrich congenital muscular dystrophy type 1."

However, relatively little about microplastic quantities in the deeper areas of the oceans is known, due to the difficulty to reach these environments. In this work, we present an investigation of microplastic (<5 mm) distribution performed in the bottom sediments of the abyssal plain off the coast and the canyon of Toulon (France). Four samples of deep-sea sediment were collected at the depth of 2443 m during the sea operations carried out by the French oceanographic cruises for the KM3NeT project. The chemical and physical characterisation of the sediment was carried out, and items were extracted from sediments by density separation and analysed by optical microscope and µRaman spectroscopy. Results show microplastics in the deep-sea sediments with a concentration of about 80 particles L-1, confirming the hypothesis of microplastics spread to abyssal sediments in the Mediterranean Sea."

Adequate food loss and waste (FLW) management has been proposed as an approach to meet these objectives. The main hypothesis of this study is to consider that the ""strong fluctuations and short-term changes"" on eating habits may have major consequences on potential FLW generation and management, as well as on GHG emissions, all taking into account the nutritional and the economic cost. Due to the exceptional lockdown measures imposed by the Spanish government, as a consequence of the emerging coronavirus disease, COVID-19, food production and consumption systems have undergone significant changes, which must be properly studied in order to propose strategies from the lessons learned. Taking Spain as a case study, the methodological approach included a deep analysis of the inputs and outputs of the Spanish food basket, the supply chain by means of a Material Flow Analysis, as well as an economic and comprehensive nutritional assessment, all under a life cycle thinking approach. The results reveal that during the first weeks of the COVID-19 lockdown, there was no significant adjustment in overall FLW generation, but a partial reallocation from extra-domestic consumption to households occurred (12% increase in household FLW). Moreover, the economic impact (+11%), GHG emissions (+10%), and the nutritional content (-8%) complete the multivariable impact profile that the COVID-19 outbreak had on FLW generation and management. Accordingly, this study once again highlights that measures aimed at reducing FLW, particularly in the household sector, are critical to make better use of food surpluses and FLW prevention and control, allowing us to confront future unforeseen scenarios.

1413,3-hydroxy butyrate dehydrogenase 2 deficiency aggravates systemic lupus erythematosus progression in a mouse model by promoting CD40 ligand demethylation,"Bo Yang,Shihao Hou,Jingjing Zhao,Yepeng Li,Bo Yang,Shihao Hou,Jingjing Zhao,Yepeng Li","The implications of the CD40-CD40 ligand (CD40L) signaling pathway in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) were well documented, due to its important role among immune cells. Previous research found that 3-hydroxy butyrate dehydrogenase 2 (BDH2), a modulator of intracellular iron homeostasis and iron transportation promoted the pathogenic process of SLE by regulating the demethylation of cd70, cd11a, and cd40l genes among CD4 + T cells. The purpose of this study was to explore the role of BDH2 in oxidative damage-induced SLE. First, CD4 + T cells treated with H2O2 were injected into the tail vein of mice to establish a lupus model. CD40L knockdown significantly decreased CD40L expression on CD4 + T cells in the spleen of SLE mice. Compared with SLE model mice, the levels of serum anti-dsDNA antibody and urinary protein in the CD40L interference group were significantly decreased. CD40L knockdown alleviated the immune complex glomerulonephritis in syngeneic SLE mice. Moreover, the levels of IFN-γ and IL-2 were decreased. However, IL-4 and IL-10 levels were significantly upregulated in the serum of CD40L knockdown SLE mice, compared with SLE model mice. Accordingly, CD40L knockdown reduced Th1/Th2 percentage in SLE mice. Inhibiting the expression of BDH2 of CD4 + T cells promoted the demethylation of CD40L, while it inhibited cell proliferation, elevated oxidative stress through increased expression of CD40L, and thus, promoted the progress of SLE. Our results demonstrate that BDH2 aggravates the pathologic progression of SLE in mice, by increasing the demethylation level of CD40L among CD4 + T cells."
1414,"The relationship between health expenditure, CO2 emissions, and economic growth in the BRICS countries-based on the Fourier ARDL model","Fangjhy Li,Tsangyao Chang,Mei-Chih Wang,Jun Zhou,Fangjhy Li,Tsangyao Chang,Mei-Chih Wang,Jun Zhou","In this paper, we use (Yilanci et al. 2020) Fourier autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) model to study the correlation between health expenditures, CO2 emissions, and GDP fluctuations in BRICS countries from 2000 to 2019. The Fourier ARDL model has the function of bootstrap repeated simulation calculations, so that small samples can also achieve the advantages of finer inspection results. In this paper, we find that in the long term, Brazil and China are countries that both have cointegration relationships in health expenditure, CO2 emissions, and economic growth. With CO2 emissions as the dependent variable and health expenditure and economic growth as independent variables, in the short term, there is a negative causal relationship between India's CO2 emissions and health expenditure; other countries only show the relationship between CO2 emissions, health expenditure, or economic growth one-way relationship. This paper also has some policy suggestions on health expenditures and CO2 emissions in the BRICS countries at the end."
1415,Automatic detection of building typology using deep learning methods on street level images,"Gonzalez, Daniela; Rueda-Plata, Diego; Acevedo, Ana B.; Duque, Juan C.; Ramos-Pollan, Raul; Betancourt, Alejandro; Garcia, Sebastian","An exposure model is a key component for assessing potential human and economic losses from natural disasters. An exposure model consists of a spatially disaggregated description of the infrastructure and population of a region under study. Depending on the size of the settlement area, developing such models can be a costly and time-consuming task. In this paper we use a manually annotated dataset consisting of approximately 10,000 photos acquired at street level in the urban area of Medellin to explore the potential for using a convolutional neural network (CNN) to automatically detect building materials and types of lateral-load resisting systems, which are attributes that define a building's structural typology (which is a key issue in exposure models for seismic risk assessment). The results of the developed model achieved a precision of 93% and a recall of 95% when identifying nonductile buildings, which are the buildings most likely to be damaged in an earthquake. Identifying fine-grained material typology is more difficult, because many visual clues are physically hidden, but our model matches expert level performances, achieving a recall of 85% and accuracy scores ranging from 60% to 82% on the three most common building typologies, which account for 91% of the total building population in Medellin. Overall, this study shows that a CNN can make a substantial contribution to developing cost-effective exposure models."

Electrically driven plasmonic nanoantennas have been demonstrated as enabling technology. Here, we present the concept of a nanoscale organic light-emitting antenna (OLEA) as a color- and directionality-switchable point source. The device consists of laterally arranged electrically contacted gold nanoantennas with their gap filled by the organic semiconductor zinc phthalocyanine (ZnPc). Since ZnPc shows preferred hole conduction in combination with gold, the recombination zone relocates depending on the polarity of the applied voltage and couples selectively to either of the two antennas. Thereby, the emission characteristics of the device also depend on polarity. Contrary to large-area OLEDs where recombination at metal contacts significantly contributes to losses, our ultracompact OLEA structures facilitate efficient radiation into the far-field rendering transparent electrodes obsolete. We envision OLEA structures to serve as wavelength-scale pixels with tunable color and directionality for advanced display applications."
1417,PCA-DEA-tobit regression assessment with carbon emission constraints of China's logistics industry,"Deng, Fumin; Xu, Lin; Fang, Yuan; Gong, Qunxi; Li, Zhi","China's logistics industry has developed rapidly recently, but it also faces problems such as high costs, low efficiency and excessive carbon emissions, which has caused a heavy burden on the environment. However, there are few studies on the consideration of carbon emission factors in logistics performance evaluation. To this end, this study developed a comprehensive evaluation index system to assess the performance of China's logistics. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was applied to reduce the indicator dimensions and then a Slacks-Based Measure-Data Envelopment Analysis (SBM-DEA) was employed to measure and evaluate the logistics performance with and without carbon emissions constraints of 30 provinces/municipalities in China and analyze the overall level and spatial characteristics of China's logistics industry efficiency. Regression analyses using the Tobit model were then conducted to identify the driving factors. The results show that: (1) There are large regional differences in China's logistics efficiency, showing a gradual decline from east to west regions; (2) Low scale efficiency is an important factor restricting the logistics development; (3) In terms of influencing factors, regional economic and logistics development are positively related to the logistics efficiency, and energy structure and government influence are negatively related to the logistics efficiency.

1418,"The dynamic association between healthcare spending, CO2 emissions, and human development index in OECD countries: evidence from panel VAR model","Akbar, Minhas; Hussain, Ammar; Akbar, Ahsan; Ullah, Irfan","The present research aims to inspect the bidirectional association among healthcare expenditures, carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, and human development index (HDI). For this purpose, we employ a balanced panel data set of 33 OECD countries for the period 2006-2016. A newly developed econometric approach known as panel vector autoregression based on the generalized method of moments estimations is employed to test this relationship. The key empirical findings reveal that (1) all of the three main variables namely healthcare expenditures, CO2 emissions, and HDI exhibit a causal relationship, (2) there exists bidirectional causality between healthcare expenditures and CO2 emissions which suggests that CO2 emissions significantly escalate the healthcare expenditures in OECD countries. Likewise, healthcare investments also increase emissions due to higher use of energy, (3) positive bidirectional causation between healthcare expenditures and HDI entails that investments in health infrastructure lead to improvement in the overall quality of living in these countries. Moreover, a higher HDI reinforces the governments to increase their healthcare spending, and (4) there is a unidirectional negative causality between CO2 emissions and HDI which implies that carbon emissions significantly deteriorate human health and wellness in these countries. Based on these empirical outcomes, the policy prescriptions are discussed for the relevant authorities to curtail emission and enhance the quality of living of the masses."
1419,The impact of population urbanization lag on eco-efficiency: A panel quantile approach,"Zhou, Yang; Kong, Ying; Wang, Hankun; Luo, Fangyong","China's urban built-up areas have developed fast, along with land urbanization growing rapidly. However, the population of urban agglomeration has not increased simultaneously, and urbanization speed of population is much smaller compared to land expansion. This study exploits super slack-based measure to evaluate eco-efficiency for 47 cities in the Bohai Rim from year 2005-2015. A population urbanization lag index is synthesized and the ordinary least squares and generalized methods of moments estimation approaches are adopted to explore the relationship between eco-efficiency and urbanization with special concentration on the population urbanization lag. Furthermore, a panel quantile approach is conducted to interpret the impact of urbanization and population urbanization lag on eco-efficiency in different quantiles. This study shows that per capita GDP and foreign direct investment have positive effects on eco-efficiency while industry structure, urbanization, and population urbanization lag have negative influences on eco-efficiency.

1420,China's policies of building green retrofit: A state-of-the-art overview,"Liu, Guo; Tan, Yongtao; Li, Xiaohu","Green retrofit in existing buildings is of great significance in achieving a sustainable environment. Various policies have been introduced around the world to promote building green retrofit, whereas the uptake is rare for policy ineffectiveness. To improve policy effectiveness, it has been emphasized that a systematic review of existing retrofit policies has a key priority. In this study, a comprehensive review on retrofit policies in China was conducted because there are great application potential for green retrofit in China's existing buildings. This study examined the state-of-the-art development of retrofit policies during 1996-2019 and explored policy characteristics based on content analysis. The ambitious retrofit objectives and multiple retrofit instruments were identified. The relevant policy instruments can be grouped into six categories, including command and control, economic incentives, technology, information, certification, organization & professional. The most cited policy was the command and control instrument, followed by the certification-based instrument. Moreover, policy instruments related to economic incentives, technology and information were also valued by the China government, while the government attempted to reduce the adoption of economic incentives and technology measures since 2010. In addition, organization & professional instruments are largely ignored in China. In the light of these findings, a roadmap was proposed to enhance the effectiveness of building retrofit policies. This study sheds lights on the effectiveness of China's building policies to accelerate the popularity of green retrofit, and provides valuable references for other countries and regions to shape their own policy pathways towards the large-scale promotion of building green retrofit."

Grid extension to remote areas has previously been constrained due to difficult terrain for construction and vast investment. Fast development of decentralized renewable energy production technologies provides opportunity for tackling the challenges. The study aims to demonstrate the techno-economic feasibility of off-grid hybrid renewable energy system for remote rural electrification, via a case study of a village in West China by performing simulation, optimization and sensitivity analysis. Daily and seasonal characteristics of energy supply as well as demand sizes and patterns of remote rural areas are considered. Different combinations of PV panels, wind turbine and biogas generator are modeled and optimized in Hybrid Optimization Model for Electric Renewables (HOMER). The most cost competitive configuration is determined whilst ensuring a reliable power supply featuring residential, community, commercial and agricultural demand of the village. Comparison of the off-grid hybrid power system and grid extension has been carried out. Results show that a hybrid power system comprising solar, wind and biomass is a reliable and cost-effective option for sustainable remote rural electrification whilst achieving environmental benefits.

Although empirical studies have been conducted on this topic, the relationship between biomass energy production and the ecological footprint has been overlooked in the literature. This study seeks to fill this gap by investigating the effects of biomass energy production on the ecological footprint of the G7 countries for the period 1980-2016. For this purpose, we use a set of methods, that help overcome the problem of cross-sectional dependence in panel data analysis. The findings from dynamic seemingly unrelated regression (DSUR) estimation show that biomass energy production increases the ecological footprint of the G7 countries. Meanwhile, a Dumitrescu-Hurlin causality test provides evidence that unidirectional causality runs from biomass energy production to the ecological footprint. Based on these empirical results, several policy recommendations are proposed for the G7 countries. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."
1423,Kinetics of atrial and brain natriuretic peptides during hemodialysis are regulated in association with different cardiac functional changes,"Takeshi Horio,Shogo Ito,Kohei Fujimoto,Yasuhiro Izumiya,Minoru Yoshiyama,Yoshio Iwashima,Satoko Nakamura,Fumiki Yoshihara,Takeshi Horio,Shogo Ito,Kohei Fujimoto,Yasuhiro Izumiya,Minoru Yoshiyama,Yoshio Iwashima,Satoko Nakamura,Fumiki Yoshihara","The blood levels of atrial and brain natriuretic peptides (ANP and BNP) are both increased markedly in hemodialysis patients, but the kinetics of the two are not always parallel. The present study investigated the association of changes in ANP and BNP levels before and after dialysis with changes in cardiac function in hemodialysis patients. A total of 57 patients (mean age 64 years, 47 males and 10 females) on maintenance hemodialysis with sinus rhythm were enrolled. Blood samples were taken at the beginning and end of dialysis, and plasma levels of ANP and BNP were measured. Changes in cardiac function during dialysis were examined by echocardiography performed just before and after dialysis. Both plasma ANP and BNP concentrations decreased significantly after hemodialysis, but the rate of decrease in BNP [mean ± SD, 555 ± 503 to 519 ± 477 pg/mL (- 6.4%), P = 0.011] was much smaller than that in ANP [233 ± 123 to 132 ± 83 pg/mL (- 43.4%), P < 0.001]. As for the relation to the changes in echocardiographic parameters before and after dialysis, the decrease in inferior vena cava diameter had a close correlation with the decrease in ANP (r = 0.528, P < 0.001), but not BNP. In contrast, the decrease in left ventricular end-diastolic volume index was correlated only with the decrease in BNP (r = 0.297, P = 0.035). The peak velocity ratio of early diastolic to atrial filling decreased with preload reduction by dialysis, and its decrease was more strongly correlated with the decrease in BNP (r = 0.407, P = 0.002) than that in ANP (r = 0.273, P = 0.040). These results demonstrated that in hemodialysis patients, the decrease in plasma ANP by a single dialysis was essentially caused by blood volume reduction, while BNP decrease was mainly induced by the reduction of left ventricular overload. Our findings indicate that the kinetics of both peptides during dialysis are regulated by different cardiac and hemodynamic factors."
1424,Progress of the applications of bio-oil,"Hu, Xun; Gholizadeh, Mortaza","Bio-oil is considered a renewable feedstock for the production of energy, fuels, chemicals and carbon materials. These specifically include the direct combustion of bio-oil as a boiler fuel, the production of biofuel from bio-oil via hydrotreatment, or the production of value-added chemicals via separation and acid-catalysis/hydrogenation or the conversion of bio-oil to carbon materials via polymerisation/cracking. So far, considerable efforts have been made to develop feasible method for utilizing bio-oil. However, it remains a challenge to find a suitable outlet for the commercial application of bio-oil. The conversion of bio-oil into the useful products has been the focus of numerous studies. Therefore, the review of the progress of this area is of importance for providing the necessary information for assessing the feasibility of the varied process for the application of bio-oil in a comparative manner. This work reviewed the progress of bio-oil as the feedstock for the use as boiler, heavy-duty engine fuel, or the use as the feedstock for the production biofuel, hydrogen, chemicals, carbonaceous materials, binder for electrode and asphalt, pesticide and fertilizer, polyurethane foam and plastics. In addition, the major issues associated with the application of bio-oil as well as the techno-economic aspects of each application were analysed as well. Suggestions were given for the future developments in each application. The analysis indicated that majority of these technologies are mainly in the initial stages of developments. Either cost or the technical issues are the major barrier for the commercial application of bio-oil in large scale."

While these changes have been extensively characterized across a number of species, we know much less about the degree to which these changes in turn influence cognitive processes like associative learning, memory and spatial navigation. Here, we assessed male Astatotilapia burtoni, an African cichlid fish known for its dynamic social dominance hierarchies, in a set of cognitive tasks both before and after a community perturbation in which some individuals ascended in dominance status. We assayed steroid hormone (cortisol, testosterone) levels before and after the community experienced a social perturbation. We found that ascending males changed their physiology and novel object recognition preference during the perturbation, and they subsequently differed in social competence from non-ascenders. Additionally, using a principal component analysis we were able to identify specific cognitive and physiological attributes that appear to predispose certain individuals to ascend in social status once a perturbation occurs. These previously undiscovered relationships between social ascent and cognition further emphasize the broad influence of social dominance on animal decision-making. This article is part of the theme issue 'The centennial of the pecking order: current state and future prospects for the study of dominance hierarchies'."
1426,Vegetable wastes as a bio-additive for low-salt preservation of raw goat skin: An attempt to reduce salinity in leather manufacture,"Alagumuthu Tamil Selvi,Yasmin Khambhaty,Samidurai Sugapriya,Gladstone Christopher Jayakumar,Alagumuthu Tamil Selvi,Yasmin Khambhaty,Samidurai Sugapriya,Gladstone Christopher Jayakumar","Preservation or curing of hides/skins is performed as the primary step of leather processing to conserve them from putrefaction. Normally preservation is carried out using common salt (NaCl), which is discharged in the soak liquor contributing to ~ 70%, of total dissolved solids (TDS) load of entire leather manufacturing. In an attempt to reduce the TDS and chlorides, phyto-based preservation using garlic peel (Allium sativum) and white onion peel (Allium cepa) was carried out. Different concentrations of salt in combination with garlic peel and white onion peel were applied on freshly flayed goat skins based on its green weight and compared to control (40% salt). Sensory evaluation of the preserved skin was done by assessing different parameters like hair slip, putrefaction and odour. Estimation of hydroxyproline (HP) release, moisture content and microbial load were carried out at regular intervals. Skins that remained in good condition for 14 days were further processed into leather and properties were examined which were found comparable to the conventionally cured skins. Hence, this cleaner curing technique helps in reducing the TDS and chlorides in the effluent, thus controlling the pollution caused by tanneries through sustainable leather processing."

1428,"Neighborhoods, Schools, and Adolescent Violence: Ecological Relative Deprivation, Disadvantage Saturation, or Cumulative Disadvantage?","Nicolo P Pinchak,Raymond R Swisher,Nicolo P Pinchak,Raymond R Swisher","Neighborhood and school socioeconomic ""disadvantage"" are consequential for youth violence perpetration. This study considers alternative ecological cumulative disadvantage, disadvantage saturation, and relative deprivation hypotheses regarding how the association between neighborhood disadvantage and violence varies by levels of socioeconomic disadvantage in schools. These hypotheses are tested with data from Wave I of Add Health (n = 15,581; 51% Female; Age mean = 15.67, SD = 1.74). Cross-classified multilevel Rasch models are used to estimate the interaction between neighborhood and school disadvantage in predicting adolescent violence. Consistent with the ecological relative deprivation hypothesis, results indicate that the association between neighborhood disadvantage and violence is most pronounced among youth attending low-disadvantage schools. Further, youth exposed to high-disadvantage neighborhoods and low-disadvantage schools tend to be at the greatest risk of perpetrating violence. These patterns are evident among both males and females, and particularly among older youth and those from low-parent education families. This study motivates future investigations considering how adolescents' experiences beyond the neighborhood shape how they engage with and experience the effects of their neighborhoods."
1429,Techno-economic comparison of green ammonia production processes,"Zhang, Hanfei; Wang, Ligang; Van Herle, Jan; Marechal, Francois; Desideri, Umberto","To reduce the fossil-fuel consumption and the impacts of conventional ammonia production on climate change, green ammonia production processes using green hydrogen need to be investigated. For commercial production scale, potential alternatives can be based on biomass gasification and water electrolysis via renewable energy, namely biomass- and power-to-ammonia. The former generally uses entrained flow gasifier due to low CO2 and almost no tar, and air separation units are shared by the gasifier and ammonia synthesis. The latter may use solid-oxide electrolyzer due to high electrical efficiency and the possibility of heat integration with the ammonia synthesis process. In this paper, techno-economic feasibility of these two green ammonia production processes are investigated and compared with the state-of-the-art methane-to-ammonia process, considering system-level heat integration and optimal placement of steam cycles for heat recovery. With a reference ammonia production of 50 kton/year, the results show that there are trade-offs between the overall energy efficiency (LHV) and ammonia production cost for all three cases. The biomass-to-ammonia is the most exothermic but is largely limited by the large heat requirement of acid gas removal. The steam cycles with three pressure levels are able to maximize the heat utilization at the system level. The power-to-ammonia achieves the highest system efficiency of over 74%, much higher than that of biomass-to-ammonia (44%) and methane-to-ammonia (61%). The biomass-to-ammonia reaches above 450 $/ton ammonia production cost with a payback time of over 6 years, higher than those of methane-to-ammonia (400 $/ton, 5 years). The power-to-ammonia is currently not economically feasible due to high stack costs and electricity prices; however, it can be competitive with a payback time of below 5 years with mass production of solid-oxide industry and increased renewable power penetration."
1430,Development level and the impact of technological factor on renewable energy production,"Bamati, Narges; Raoofi, Ali","This study provides a comprehensive analysis of the drivers of renewable energy production by employing variables of technological factors, economic factors, and environmental factors for two panels of developed and developing countries. Using GLS (Generalized Least Square) panel data estimation method, this paper finds that the determinants towards renewable sources vary in accordance with the level of income. The results reveal that renewable energy production is significantly determined by high technology export in developed countries, while high technology export is not statistically significant in explaining the use of RE sources in developing countries. Oil price has the smallest impact on renewable energy production in both groups. Although GDP per capita yields a positive impact on renewable energy production per capita in both groups, per capita CO2 emission shows considerably different impacts in developed and developing countries.

1431,Effects of plate contouring quality on the biomechanical performance of high tibial osteotomy fixation: A parametric finite element study,"Zahra Hayatbakhsh,Farzam Farahmand,Zahra Hayatbakhsh,Farzam Farahmand","Locking plates have threaded holes, in which threaded-head screws are affixed. Hence, they do not need to be in intimate contact with underlying bone to provide fixation. There are, however, reports that a large distance between the plate and the bone might cause clinical complications such as delayed union or nonunion, screw pull out, and screw and plate breakage. Considering the diversity in the capabilities and costs of different plate customization techniques, the purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of the plate contouring quality on the biomechanical performance of high tibial osteotomy (HTO) fixation. A finite element model of proximal tibia was developed in Abaqus, using the QCT data of a cadaver. The model was then subjected to open-wedge HTO (correction angle 12°) with TomoFix plate fixation. The sagittal curvature of the plate was changed parametrically to provide certain levels of geometrical fit, and the biomechanical performance parameters of fixation were assessed. Results indicated 5%, 9% and 38% increase in the stiffness of the construct, and the von Mises stress in the plate and locking screw just above the osteotomy site, respectively, when the level of fit of plate changed from 0% (initial non-contoured initial shape) to 100% (fully adapted shape). The same change decreased the pressure at the lateral hinge of the osteotomy by 61%, and the mean of the tensile stress on the screw shaft by 12%. It was concluded that the level of fit has conflicting effects on the biomechanical parameters of the HTO fixation system, that is, the structural stiffness, the pressure at the lateral hinge, the stresses in the plate and screws, and the pull out resistance of the screws. In particular, for HTO patients with high quality bone, the optimal level of fit should provide a tradeoff between these parameters."
1432,Vascular Contributions to Brain Health: Cross-Cutting Themes,"Steven M Greenberg,Steven M Greenberg","As life expectancy grows, brain health is increasingly seen as central to what we mean by successful aging-and vascular brain health as central to overall brain health. Cerebrovascular pathologies are highly prevalent independent contributors to age-related cognitive impairment and at least partly modifiable with available treatments. The current Focused Update addresses vascular brain health from multiple angles, ranging from pathophysiologic mechanisms and neuroimaging features to epidemiologic risk factors, social determinants, and candidate treatments. Here we highlight some of the shared themes that cut across these distinct perspectives: (1) the lifetime course of vascular brain injury pathogenesis and progression; (2) the scientific and ethical imperative to extend vascular brain health research in non-White and non-affluent populations; (3) the need for improved tools to study the cerebral small vessels themselves; (4) the potential role for brain recovery mechanisms in determining vascular brain health and resilience; and (5) the cross-pathway mechanisms by which vascular and neurodegenerative processes may interact. The diverse perspectives featured in this Focused Update offer a sense of the multidisciplinary approaches and collaborations that will be required to launch our populations towards improved brain health and successful aging."
1433,The effect of urban air pollutants in Germany: eco-efficiency analysis through fractional regression models applied after DEA and SFA efficiency predictions,"Moutinho, Victor; Madaleno, Mara; Macedo, Pedro","Cities and living standards contribute intensively to air pollution, an environmental risk factor which causes diseases. Recently, in developed countries, the majority of cities has grown rapidly and has experienced increasing environmental problems. In this article we analyze the effect of urban air pollution considering the available data for the years 2007, 2010 and 2013 in 24 German cities. Proposing a new model, we start the analysis using data envelopment analysis (DEA) and stochastic frontier analysis (SFA) to predict eco-efficiency scores for the 24 German cities. Afterwards, it is applied fractional regression to infer about the influencing factors of the eco-efficiency scores, at the city level. Results suggest a significant impact over eco-efficiency due to the excess of PM10, the average temperature, the average of NO2 concentration and rainfall. The findings in this study hold important implications for policymakers and urban planners in Germany, especially those that coordinate environmental protection and economic development in cities. Therefore, interventions to reduce urban air pollution can be accomplished on different regulatory levels, leading to synergistic effects as the decrease of climate change effects and noise."

This study aimed to assess the ameliorative effects of nicotine, in rotenone-induced PD rat model. Thirty adult male Albino Wistar rats were divided into three equal groups. Group I received an injection of normal saline. Group II received subcutaneous injection of rotenone at a dose of 1.5 mg/kg every other day. Group III received rotenone in the same previous dose and nicotine at a dose of 1.5 mg/kg daily. After 11 days of treatment, body weight (BW) and rat motor behavior were estimated. Specimens from the midbrain were processed for light and electron microscopy. The expression of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), α-synuclein, and GFAP was examined. Serum levels of total antioxidant capacity (TAC) and malondialdehyde (MDA), and striatal levels of dopamine (DA) were analyzed. Group III revealed a significant improvement in BW and motor activity. Nicotine upregulated the expression of TH, downregulated the expression of α-synuclein and GFAP. The levels of MDA and TAC were improved but were still far from those of the control. Striatal DA levels increased. Nicotine activated the neurons and glial cells. The vascular endothelium, however, did not elicit improvement. Although nicotine ameliorated the loss of the dopaminergic neurons and motor deficit, it did not show improvement of vascular endothelium. It is still necessary to examine nicotin's ability to maintain the dopaminergic neurons in a good functioning state."

1436,Hypothesis Testing for Network Data with Power Enhancement,"Yin Xia,Lexin Li,Yin Xia,Lexin Li","Comparing two population means of network data is of paramount importance in a wide range of scientific applications. Numerous existing network inference solutions focus on global testing of entire networks, without comparing individual network links. The observed data often take the form of vectors or matrices, and the problem is formulated as comparing two covariance or precision matrices under a normal or matrix normal distribution. Moreover, many tests suffer from a limited power under a small sample size. In this article, we tackle the problem of network comparison, both global and simultaneous inferences, when the data come in a different format, i.e., in the form of a collection of symmetric matrices, each of which encodes the network structure of an individual subject. Such data format commonly arises in applications such as brain connectivity analysis and clinical genomics. We no longer require the underlying data to follow a normal distribution, but instead impose some moment conditions that are easily satisfied for numerous types of network data. Furthermore, we propose a power enhancement procedure, and show that it can control the false discovery, while it has the potential to substantially enhance the power of the test. We investigate the efficacy of our testing procedure through both an asymptotic analysis and a simulation study under a finite sample size. We further illustrate our method with examples of brain connectivity analysis."
1437,The impact of renewable energy consumption on income inequality: Evidence from developed countries,"Topcu, Mert; Tugcu, Can Tansel","Despite of the great number of studies on the impact that income gap has on the environment, we still do not know much about whether renewable energy could be a factor affecting income inequality. The goal of this study is therefore to investigate the impact of renewable energy consumption on income inequality in a panel group of developed economies over the period 1990-2014. To this end, the study employs two dynamic panel data estimation techniques: (i) panel generalized method of moments in which slope coefficients are not allowed to vary, and (ii) the dynamic common correlated effects estimator in which heterogeneity and cross-sectional dependence is taken into consideration. The results obtained from the both estimators indicate that an increase in renewable energy consumption leads to a decrease in income inequality. Beyond the environmental concerns, this result confirms that adoption of renewable energy sources will also play a crucial role in reducing income inequality. In addition, it is also proved that the role of renewable energy consumption on income inequality is robust to estimation technique. Policy implications of these results are also discussed.

1438,The influence of carbon tax on the ecological efficiency of China's energy intensive industries-A inter-fuel and inter-factor substitution perspective,"Tan, Ruipeng; Lin, Boqiang","China's energy intensive industries have posed great challenges in achieving carbon emissions reduction goals. We calculate the influence of carbon tax levying on the CO2 emissions as well as ecological efficiency of China's energy intensive industries utilizing inter-fuel and inter-factor substitution channel. To allow for the slow adjustment process of the enterprises of different fuels and factors inputs, a dynamic model and three-stage estimation procedure are used. Based on the substitution among fuels and factors, the results indicate that carbon tax levying will make the enterprises transform from consuming coal (with a higher carbon efficient) to lower oil/gas and electricity, and from inputting energy to inputting more labor and capital. Therefore, carbon tax is conductive for the CO2 reduction in China's energy intensive industries. With regard to the two kinds of ecological efficiency, carbon tax plays a negative role in improving them. Thus, carbon tax levy is suggested to reduce the carbon dioxide emissions in China's energy intensive industries. The future assessment tasks should include the ecological efficiency in to make the assessment more reasonable."
1439,Evaluating the potential health and economic effects of nitrogen fertilizer application in grain production systems of China,"Wang, Yichao; Lu, Yonglong","In past decades, large amounts of N fertilizers have been applied in agricultural production of China. N fertilizer has not only underpinned food production but also led to great concerns about negative environmental impacts. We used a life cycle assessment (LCA) approach to assess nitrogen fertilizer induced potential human health risk (HHR) and human capital loss (HCL) of rice, wheat and maize production systems. We found that the HHR of rice, wheat and maize was 633004, 264105 and 418644 DALY/yr, respectively. The rice production system caused the highest potential risk while the wheat production system the lowest. Fine particulate matter formation (FPMF) was the most serious health risk index, and accounted for nearly 87% of HHR. Sown area and crop type both play an important role in HHR. The potential loss of human capital caused by rice, wheat and maize production are 37.5, 15.6 and 24.8 billion RMB/yr, respectively. The total HCL accounted for about 5.9% of the Chinese grain yield value in 2017. We constructed 3 scenarios to evaluate the potential for reduction of human health risk. In scenario A, reducing N fertilizer rates to an appropriate level, the HHR decreased by about 23%, while in scenario B, enhancing nitrogen use efficiency and production technology, decreased HHR by about 22%. Furthermore, when we combined both scenario A and B, the HHR was reduced by as much as 37%. Improving fertilizer management practices in grain production in China has a great potential to reduce adverse impacts on human health, and more attention should also be paid to the impacts of air pollutant emissions from agricultural production on human health.

1440,Enhanced curcumin loaded nanocellulose: a possible inhalable nanotherapeutic to treat COVID-19,"Thennakoon M Sampath U Gunathilake,Yern Chee Ching,Hiroshi Uyama,Nguyen Dai Hai,Cheng Hock Chuah,Thennakoon M Sampath U Gunathilake,Yern Chee Ching,Hiroshi Uyama,Nguyen Dai Hai,Cheng Hock Chuah","Nanocellulose/polyvinyl alcohol/curcumin (CNC/PVA/curcumin) nanoparticles with enhanced drug loading properties were developed by the dispersion of nanocellulose in curcumin/polyvinyl alcohol aqueous medium. Due to the physical and chemical nature of sulphuric acid hydrolyzed nanocellulose and the antiviral properties of curcumin, the possibility of using these nanoparticles as an inhalable nanotherapeutic for the treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is discussed. The adsorption of curcumin and PVA into nanocellulose, and the presence of anionic sulphate groups, which is important for the interaction with viral glycoproteins were confirmed by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. FESEM images showed that the diameter of nanocellulose ranged from 50 to 100 nm, which is closer to the diameter (60-140 nm) of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The solubility of poorly water-soluble curcumin was increased from 40.58 ± 1.42 to 313.61 ± 1.05 mg/L with increasing the PVA concentration from 0.05 to 0.8% (w/v) in aqueous medium. This is a significant increase in the solubility compared to curcumin's solubility in carboxymethyl cellulose medium in our previous study. The drug loading capacity increased by 22-fold with the addition of 0.8% PVA to the nanocellulose dispersed curcumin solution. The highest drug release increased from 1.25 ± 0.15 mg/L to 17.11 ± 0.22 mg/L with increasing the PVA concentration from 0 to 0.8% in the drug-loaded medium. Future studies of this material will be based on the antiviral efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 and cell cytotoxicity studies. Due to the particulate nature, morphology and size of SARS-CoV-2, nanoparticle-based strategies offer a strong approach to tackling this virus. Hence, we believe that the enhanced loading of curcumin in nanocellulose will provide a promising nano-based solution for the treatment of COVID-19."
1441,Environmental feasibility of secondary use of electric vehicle lithium-ion batteries in communication base stations,"Yang, Jie; Gu, Fu; Guo, Jianfeng","Repurposing spent batteries in communication base stations (CBSs) is a promising option to dispose massive spent lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) from electric vehicles (EVs), yet the environmental feasibility of this practice remains unknown. Life cycle assessment (LCA) is used in this study to compare the environmental impacts of repurposed EV LIBs and lead-acid batteries (LABs) used in conventional energy storage systems (ESSs) of CBSs. The economic-based allocation method is used in the multi-functional system. The LCA results suggest that the manufacturing and reusing stages are the dominant contributors to the environmental impacts of repurposed LIBs, whereas battery recycling can reduce environmental impacts. In addition, the secondary use of EV LIBs results in less environmental impact than the use of LABs in all selected categories, except for metal depletion, which is attributed to the large lead consumption and low energy density of LABs. A sensitivity analysis is conducted to measure the influences of two alternative allocation methods (i.e., cut-off allocation and 50/50 allocation), the cycle life, and the electricity sources on the results. It is found that repurposing spent LIBs with 50/50 allocation method has the poorest environmental performance and is not sufficiently advantageous over using LABs. Moreover, extending the cycle life of repurposed LIBs and using a cleaner energy mix significantly reduce environmental impacts. This study offers implications to mitigate the end-of-life management problem of EV LIBs, including a life cycle management platform, an effective integration of the supply chain, and references for the ongoing ""green"" transition of the communication industry."

Results indicate that the participants' intraverbal responses for metaphorical extensions about emotions emerged or increased without direct training after completion of the instructional sequence to which verbal instruction had been added. All three children maintained the metaphorical extensions about emotions for 4 weeks."
1443,Optimal sizing and power schedule in PV household-prosumers for improving PV self-consumption and providing frequency containment reserve,"Gomez-Gonzalez, M.; Hernandez, J. C.; Vera, D.; Jurado, F.","This paper presents a methodology for jointly optimizing the sizing and power management of PV household-prosumers, namely, photovoltaic (PV) power, electric vehicle charging load (EVCL), household consumption load (HCL), battery bank (BB), and power converters. The optimization includes PV self-consumption enhancement and frequency containment reserve (FCR). This innovative model uses an annual techno-economic assessment to calculate the total costs and revenue by means of the teaching-learning-based optimization (TLBO) algorithm. The assessment of BB aging takes into account the charge/discharge power as well as the depth of discharge (DOD). This methodology is applied to Spanish PV household-prosumers. Results are obtained for scenarios involving PV, EV, and BB. Moreover, the PV household-prosumer approximated the smart user concept by providing FCR service. The scenarios envisaged examined potential revenues based on markets (day-ahead and FCR market) and their influence on profitability. The results of this study confirmed that BB is a cost-effective way of enhancing PV self-consumption by decreasing the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE). In fact, when FCR provision was added, there was a significant increase in the total revenue with a relatively low impact on BB aging. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."
1444,Consumer's food waste in different restaurants configuration: A comparison between different levels of incentive and interaction,"Matzembacher, Daniele Eckert; Brancoli, Pedro; Maia, Lais Moltene; Eriksson, Mattias","Reducing food waste is necessary for achieving healthy diets and sustainable food systems due to its negative impacts on resource conservation, food security, and environmental, social and economic costs. This paper aim is to quantify the amount and types of food that is wasted by the consumers in different restaurant configurations. The second aim is to understand the reasons which lead them to waste food and the greenhouse gas emissions associated with the waste. To fulfil the aims, a mixed methodology was used, including primary data collection in restaurants for the quantification of food waste, interviewing consumers and staff, along with calculating the environmental impact from the waste using life cycle assessment. The results show that different incentives and levels of interaction in consumer's choice of food types exert influence on plate food waste. When incentive and interaction are low, the amount of food waste is larger. It is the case of a la carte restaurants. The best performance in the restaurant categories was when both incentive and level of interaction were higher. Buffet where the consumers pay by weight, therefore, is the configuration that generates less food waste on the consumer's plate. The main wasted products are rice and beans, followed by beef, and then other carbohydrates. The life cycle assessment indicated a carbon footprint varying from 128 to 324 g CO2 eq./plate from the wasted food. The result of the interviews showed that the food waste on the plate is not visible to consumers, since in the majority of cases, they believe that their food waste on the plate in the day of the observation was an exception. There is a large potential to reduce food waste by giving consumers the possibility to influence the serving to get the right portion size. Also, to further emphasize this behaviour by creating incentives for consumers only to serve as much food as they actually eat. (C) 2020 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Egret's Eggs, egg shells, food (fish and insects), blood, meat samples (thigh, liver, and chest), water, soil and sediments samples were collected from the two selected sites of the study area. Samples were analysed on flame atomic absorption spectrometer after acid digestion. Detected metals were found almost inline of concentrations when compared with the both sites. Among detected metals Mn was found higher in concentration (µg/g) i.e. 18.509 followed by Zn i.e. 9.383, Ni, Cu, Pb and Cd. Sediment exhibited higher levels (µg/g) of metals (25.061) followed by the meat (19.044) egrets food (18.825), excreta (16.26), blood serums (4.577), eggs (3.626) and water samples (2.432).The level of metals in sediments of the study are showed environmental concerns. Health risks were also investigated that were compared to guidelines of WHO and FAO threshold limits. It was found a marginal health risk to life through detected metals. This study revealed that little egret are good bio-indicator for the screening and investigation of contaminates presence in the environment."
1446,LCA analysis of food waste co-digestion,"Bartocci, Pietro; Zampilli, Mauro; Liberti, Federica; Pistolesi, Valentina; Massoli, Sara; Bidini, Gianni; Fantozzi, Francesco","The i-REXFO LIFE project designs an innovative business model with the objective of reducing significantly the amount of landfilled food waste. Given the availability of supermarket food waste in the Umbria region (Italy), the logistics is optimized using a Vehicle Routing Problem Solver, mass and energy balances of the biogas plant are partly calculated and partly measured from a real biogas plant. The data obtained from food waste transport and anaerobic co-digestion process are used as input for LCA analysis. The aimof themethodology is to assess the environmental and economic benefit of the substitution of energy crops (like corn silage) with food waste in anaerobic digestion. Two approaches are adopted: consequential LCA and attributional LCA. Only one impact category is taken into account: climate change. This decision has been taken to focus on two decision making criteria (economic feasibility and GHG emissions reduction). The results show that a reduction of 42% in the carbon foot-print of the electricity produced fromthe biogas plant can be obtained by substituting about 9900 t of corn silage with 6600 t of food waste. Through the combined use of economic analysis and consequential LCA it has been possible to identify an optimized scenario in which: food waste produced from food industries is collected and used to produce energy in Expired Food Energy chains (EFE), while the food obtained from supermarkets is used to promote charity initiatives in actions aiming at the Reduction of Expired Food waste (REF).

1447,The effect of emission trading policy on carbon emission reduction: Evidence from an integrated study of pilot regions in China,"Zhang, Yifei; Li, Sheng; Luo, Tianyuan; Gao, Jing","Carbon trading systems are increasingly used by many countries nowadays to reduce carbon emission and improve the quality of environment. To evaluate the effect of emission trading system on carbon emission reduction, this study applies a robust econometric method difference-in-difference estimation on city-level panel data in China from 2004 to 2015. The findings of this study indicate that the emission trading policy adopted in pilot regions has reduced carbon emission by approximately 16.2% and such effect is particularly prominent in eastern areas of China where the economy is more developed. Moreover, other factors such as the development of the second industry and foreign direct investment are also found to affect carbon emission. The results of this study provide evidence for the success of the emission trading system in reducing carbon emission across pilot cities and suggest that an expanded scope of carbon trading mechanism adopted in China would further control the carbon emission. Meanwhile, a multi-level emission trading system from central to local government needs to be built using a variety of market-based instruments to promote the equal development of carbon trading market in various regions with different economic development levels."
1448,Neural-network-based optimization for economic dispatch of combined heat and power systems,"Kim, Min Jae; Kim, Tong Seop; Flores, Robert J.; Brouwer, Jack","One of the major research areas in combined heat and power (CHP) systems is optimal dispatch, which involves the minimization of the operating cost. In economic dispatch, it is important to use a model that accurately simulates the performance of the power and heat generation equipment. However, physics-based characteristic models require considerable time for the analysis, so it is hard to apply them to the optimization of dispatch schedules. This study introduced a neural network model, which was built based upon the simulation results of a physics-based model, to optimize a CHP system. The novel method was used to optimize the operation schedule of a system consisting of a gas turbine, steam turbine bottoming cycle, compressed air energy storage, and a boiler. The schedule was optimized to minimize the operation cost per day and according to the power and heating demand of users. The results showed that the introduction of the neural network reduced the time required for the system analysis by more than 7000 times. Furthermore, the optimization results confirmed the importance of accurately predicting the performance of each device using the physics-based model. This study contributes to the reduction in computation time and improvement of optimization accuracy."
1449,Sleep and circadian rhythms in Parkinson's disease and preclinical models,"Jeremy Hunt,Elizabeth J Coulson,Rajendram Rajnarayanan,Henrik Oster,Aleksandar Videnovic,Oliver Rawashdeh,Jeremy Hunt,Elizabeth J Coulson,Rajendram Rajnarayanan,Henrik Oster,Aleksandar Videnovic,Oliver Rawashdeh","The use of animals as models of human physiology is, and has been for many years, an indispensable tool for understanding the mechanisms of human disease. In Parkinson's disease, various mouse models form the cornerstone of these investigations. Early models were developed to reflect the traditional histological features and motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease. However, it is important that models accurately encompass important facets of the disease to allow for comprehensive mechanistic understanding and translational significance. Circadian rhythm and sleep issues are tightly correlated to Parkinson's disease, and often arise prior to the presentation of typical motor deficits. It is essential that models used to understand Parkinson's disease reflect these dysfunctions in circadian rhythms and sleep, both to facilitate investigations into mechanistic interplay between sleep and disease, and to assist in the development of circadian rhythm-facing therapeutic treatments. This review describes the extent to which various genetically- and neurotoxically-induced murine models of Parkinson's reflect the sleep and circadian abnormalities of Parkinson's disease observed in the clinic."
1450,Comparison of safety outcomes between bi-coronal and direct approaches for device removal in patients treated with distraction osteogenesis for craniosynostosis,"Sungmi Jeon,Jiwon Kang,Jee Hyeok Chung,Sukwha Kim,Seung-Ki Kim,Ji Hoon Phi,Ji Yeoun Lee,Kyung Hyun Kim,Kyu-Chang Wang,Byung Jun Kim,Sungmi Jeon,Jiwon Kang,Jee Hyeok Chung,Sukwha Kim,Seung-Ki Kim,Ji Hoon Phi,Ji Yeoun Lee,Kyung Hyun Kim,Kyu-Chang Wang,Byung Jun Kim","The study aimed at comparing the safety outcomes between conventional bicoronal and direct method in device removal after cranial distraction in the treatment of craniosynostosis. This was a retrospective cohort study of patients treated with distraction osteogenesis to expand intracranial volume in the anteroposterior direction. Preoperative patient demographics, distraction protocols, and perioperative outcomes (operative time, estimated blood loss, intraoperative fluid volume, lowest hematocrit during surgery, transfusion, hospital stay, drain, postoperative complication) were collected and analyzed with the independent samples t-test. Twenty-four patients were included in the study (15 in the conventional and 9 in the direct approach group). The mean duration of surgery and intraoperative fluid volume were significantly shorter (114.56 ± 36.91 min vs. 177.20 ± 47.00 min, p = 0.003) and less (241.88 ± 194.07 ml vs. 624.00 ± 524.92 ml, p = 0.026), respectively in the direct group than in the conventional. No patients were transfused intraoperatively and admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) postoperatively in the direct group. The mean intraoperative and total transfusion volumes were significantly greater in the conventional group (p = 0.004, 0.045, respectively). There were no significant differences in other safety outcomes. No postoperative wound complications were reported. The findings of this study indicated that the direct approach for distraction device removal in children with craniosynostosis appears to be safer than the conventional approach owing to the reduced operation time, intraoperative transfusion requirements, and ICU stay."
1451,Trophoblast emboli in the lung of a snowshoe hare ( Lepus americanus),"Marta Mainenti,Arnaud J Van Wettere,Marta Mainenti,Arnaud J Van Wettere","Spontaneous migration of placental trophoblasts into maternal blood vessels and embolization to other organs (ie, lung, adrenal gland, spleen, and liver) occurs in women and certain animals with hemochorial placentation. Although considered incidental in most species, increased incidence and numbers of trophoblast emboli are reported in women with gestational diseases with arterial hypertension (pre-eclampsia and eclampsia). To the best of our knowledge, trophoblast emboli have not been reported in lagomorphs. This case report describes the identification of trophoblast emboli in the lung of a wild snowshoe hare (Lepus americanus). Death of this hare was attributed to pulmonary hemorrhages and hemothorax, but a definitive cause for the hemorrhages was not determined. It is unclear whether trophoblast embolism normally occurs in this species and represents an incidental finding, or whether it possibly contributed to rupture of pulmonary or thoracic blood vessels leading to hemorrhage."
1452,High-resolution ultrasound in the diagnosis of failed carpal tunnel decompression: a study of 35 cases,"Enrico Carità,A Donadelli,M Laterza,P Perazzini,S Tamburin,G Zanette,Enrico Carità,A Donadelli,M Laterza,P Perazzini,S Tamburin,G Zanette","We used high-resolution ultrasound to examine 35 median nerves (35 patients) with failed carpal tunnel decompression to identify the cause of failure. The carpal tunnel was examined before revision surgery, and the results were correlated with surgical findings. The cross-sectional area was measured, and nerve morphology was analysed at the sites of compression. We found persistent median nerve compression in 30 out of 35 patients. In 20 patients, the compression was caused by a residual transverse carpal ligament, in four by perineural fibrosis, in five by both of these causes and in one by tenosynovitis. In four patients, evidence of median nerve injury with an epineural/fascicular lesion was detected; and in one, no abnormalities were found. Surgical findings were consistent with the ultrasound findings except in one patient where tenosynovitis was associated with a giant cell tumour, which was missed by ultrasound. High-resolution ultrasound can provide helpful information in preoperative diagnosis of failed carpal tunnel decompression with good correlation between the ultrasound and surgical findings.Level of evidence: IV."

Average standard deviation (SD) scores of height decreased from 0.39 (SD 1.02) in 1990 (n = 3,684) to 0.37 (SD 1.05) in 2000 (n = 2,981) and 0.33 (SD 1.07) in 2010 (n = 2,027). Mothers of children in later waves were taller, older, and more likely to be primiparous; children in later waves had shorter gestational age, lower birth weight, and were less likely to have been fed less with formula or solid foods before 6 mo. The only factor that consistently contributed to a reduction in children's height for both 1990-2000 and 2000-2010 was a reduction in birthweight SD score (indirect effect on height -1.5 [95% CI: -1.9, -1.1] mm for 1990-2000 and -1.2 [95% CI: -1.8, -0.8] mm for 2000-2010). Factors that contributed, although not significantly or consistently between the two periods, were changes in pre-pregnancy BMI, smoking during pregnancy, multiple pregnancies, gestational age, BMI at birth, and use of formula and solid foods before 6 mo. Secular increases in maternal age, height, and primiparity contributed to increasing children's height."

Cucumber juices were processed as; non-supplemented (J-Con), J-PME, J-BE, J-LE, and J-LEE supplemented with peppermint, basil, lavender, and lemongrass ethanolic extracts, respectively. Peppermint extract was significantly scavenged 88% of DPPH radicals and inhibited the growth of tested gram-positive, gram-negative bacteria and fungi followed by the lemongrass extract. The antioxidant activity of cucumber juices increased due to polyphenols and aroma compounds in the added extracts. However, the antioxidant content was decreased after two months of storage at 4 °C, due to the decrease in polyphenols. The flavor compounds were determined using GC mass, wherein hydrocarbons, acids, alcohols, and carbonyl compounds were the main aroma contents in cucumber juices, and their contents decreased with storage time. Peppermint and lemongrass extracts were significantly (p ≤ 0.05) increased the whiteness of J-PME, and J-LEE, respectively. The highest score of flavor and taste was observed in J-PME that scored 8.3 based on panelists' reports followed by J-LEE. The PME was significantly maintained 91% of the odor and color of J-PME as compared to other juices."
1455,Are animates special? Exploring the effects of selective attention and animacy on visual statistical learning,"Jolene A Cox,Timothy W Cox,Anne M Aimola Davies,Jolene A Cox,Timothy W Cox,Anne M Aimola Davies","Our visual system is built to extract regularities in how objects in our visual environment appear in relation to each other across time and space (""visual statistical learning""). Existing research indicates that visual statistical learning is modulated by selective attention. Our attentional system prioritises information that enables adaptive behaviour; for example, animates are prioritised over inanimates (the ""animacy advantage""). The present study examined the effects of selective attention and animacy on visual statistical learning in young adults (N = 284). We tested visual statistical learning of attended and unattended information across four animacy conditions: (1) living things that can self-initiate movement (animals); (2) living things that cannot self-initiate movement (fruits and vegetables); (3) non-living things that can generate movement (vehicles); and (4) non-living things that cannot generate movement (tools and kitchen utensils). We implemented a 4-point confidence rating scale as an assessment of participants' awareness of the regularities in the visual statistical learning task. There were four key findings. First, selective attention plays a critical role by modulating visual statistical learning. Second, animacy does not play a special role in visual statistical learning. Third, visual statistical learning of attended information cannot be exclusively accounted for by unconscious knowledge. Fourth, performance on the visual statistical learning task is associated with the proportion of stimuli that were named or labelled. Our findings support the notion that visual statistical learning is a powerful mechanism by which our visual system resolves an abundance of sensory input over time."
1456,The impact of COVID-19 on the delivery of care by Australian primary health care nurses,"Christine Ashley,Elizabeth Halcomb,Sharon James,Kaara Calma,Catherine Stephen,Susan McInnes,Ruth Mursa,Anna Williams,Christine Ashley,Elizabeth Halcomb,Sharon James,Kaara Calma,Catherine Stephen,Susan McInnes,Ruth Mursa,Anna Williams","This qualitative study describes the impact of the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic on the provision of care by Australian primary health care (PHC) nurses. Participants were purposefully recruited following completion of a national survey about PHC nurses' experiences during the pandemic. Twenty-five semi-structured interviews were conducted by two experienced researchers and professionally transcribed. The mean duration of interviews was 38.5 min. Thematic analysis revealed three themes about the impact of COVID-19 on PHC nurses' provision of care. These were: workplace adjustments, changes in healthcare delivery and concerns about long-term health impacts of COVID-19. The sudden disruption and de-stabilisation of care delivery was reported as significantly impacting on initial service provision, although participants reported adapting quickly and finding new ways to deliver care. The impact of the pandemic on high risk communities and mental health support needs of clients created additional challenges, although some participants reported positive outcomes such as increased confidence of some clients to provide self-care. There were concerns about the potential long-term health impact on communities due to reduced levels of cancer screening, disrupted management of chronic conditions and reduced opportunistic health assessments. Findings from this study demonstrated how PHC nurses played an important role in the continued provision of PHC by adapting quickly to changed circumstances, adjusting and modifying clinical activities, and by monitoring for future potential negative outcomes from the pandemic. These findings are important for the future management of pandemics and inform the long-term planning of PHC services."
1457,Techno Economic Analysis of Vehicle to Grid (V2G) Integration as Distributed Energy Resources in Indonesia Power System,"Huda, Muhammad; Koji, Tokimatsu; Aziz, Muhammad","High penetration of electric vehicles (EVs) leads to high stress on a power grid, especially when the supply cannot cover and actively respond to the unpredictable demand caused by charging EVs. In the Java-Madura-Bali (JAMALI) area, Indonesia, the capability of the grid to balance its supply and demand is very limited, and massive EV charging additionally worsens the condition because of unbalanced load profiles. Ancillary services of EVs have led to the idea of utilizing EV batteries for grid support, owing to their high-speed response to the fluctuating power system. In this study, a techno-economic analysis of the vehicle-to-grid (V2G) system in the JAMALI grid is conducted in terms of the changes in the feed-in tariff schemes, including regular, natural, and demand response tariffs. The results show that by utilizing EVs, the supply during peak hours can be reduced by up to 2.8% (for coal) and 8.8% (for gas). EVs owned by business entities as operating vehicles with a natural tariff show the highest feasibility for ancillary services, and can potentially reduce the cost of charging by up to 60.15%. From a power company perspective, V2G also potentially improves annual revenue by approximately 3.65%, owing to the replacement of the fuel."

In marine ecosystems, microalgae are major primary producers; among them, Chaetoceros muelleri is an important microalga in the aquaculture industry as live feed. The impacts of TiO2NPs on the growth, photosynthetic pigments, protein and lipid contents, and the interaction of TiO2NPs with the cell wall of C. muelleri were investigated in the present study. Algal cells were exposed to concentrations of 5, 10, 50, 100, 200, and 400 mg/L TiO2NPs for 10 days. There was a significant difference in the growth between the control and TiO2NPs treatments on each day. The half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of TiO2NPs on algal cells was found to be 10.08 and 5.01 mg/L on the 3rd and 10th days, respectively. The contents of chlorophyll a and c reduced significantly in the TiO2NPs-treated microalgae. TiO2NPs also reduced the protein and lipid contents in the treated microalgae, up to 13.02% and 47.6% respectively, at the highest concentration. The interaction of TiO2NPs with the C. muelleri cells was obvious based on Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, microscopic images, EDS, and Mapping analyses. Toxic effects of the released TiO2NPs can damage the stocks of C. muelleri as an important live feed in mariculture."
1459,Peer and Parental Sources of Influence Regarding Interracial and Same-Race Peer Encounters,"Amanda R Burkholder,Melanie Killen,Amanda R Burkholder,Melanie Killen","This study investigated the socializing influence of peers and parents in interracial encounters by disentangling how children and adolescents consider peer and parent messages when predicting interracial and same-race inclusion. Black and White children (9-14 years old, N = 246) predicted the likelihood of interracial and same-race peer inclusion and provided justifications for their expectations when peer and parent sources of influence were present. Results revealed that, while participants predicted that inclusion would be less likely when parent sources of influence were present than when peer sources of influence were present, the racial composition of the encounter and the race of the participant mattered only in contexts with peer sources of influence. Participants' reasoning about the benefits of inclusion and social pressure also differed when parent or peer sources were present. This study informs future research and efforts designed to improve the quality of interracial peer interactions, and for programs designed to promote positive intergroup peer relationships."
1460,The potential for energy saving and carbon emission reduction in China's regional industrial sectors,"Zhu, Qingyuan; Li, Xingchen; Li, Feng; Zhou, Dequn","Rapid economic growth of China's industry has brought many problems. Among them, the problems of energy shortage and environmental pollution have become increasingly serious. The quick development of the big data has brought new challenges and opportunities for environmental management. In this paper, we propose a new data envelopment analysis (DEA) model to analyze the energy and environmental efficiency of industrial sectors from China's 30 provincial-level regions in order to determine the potential and route for energy saving (ES) and carbon emission reduction (CER). The new DEA model not only considers the dynamic data, but also involves the technology heterogeneity and closest targets, which could achieve the potential or provide the route for ES and CER step by step with least effort. The new approach is illustrated by using the regional industrial dataset of China and some implications for ES and CER are proposed. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

This study formulates a mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) model for a combined CCHP system coupled with renewable energy, i.e. RCCHP system, which is applied in five different buildings to evaluate the economic and environmental performance under two optimization modes. Net present value (NPV), internal rate of return (IRR) and dynamic payback period (DPP) are introduced as economic indexes, while CO2 emission reduction rate (CER) is considered as the environmental indicator to determine the optimal combination, capacity, and operation strategies for energy technologies. Results indicate that a combination of electricity purchased at valley period during night with power generated by the combined heating and power (CHP) unit coupled with wind turbine in peak period during daytime is cost-optimal which also enables higher energy efficiency. Meanwhile, the feed-in tariff as well as the uncoordinated electrical and thermal loads both show a significant impact on real-time operation strategies. Compared with the reference separate production (SP) system, the combined system shows better performance when applied to shopping mall under both optimization modes, e.g., with NPV up to 67.65 and 46.61 million RMB, IRR up to 20.70% and 25.10%, and the minimum DPP is 5.49 and 4.82 years under NPV and IRR maximization, respectively.

However, the polymeric electrodes follow the trade-off relationship between toughness and stretchability. To this end, the stress dissipation encoded silk fibroin electrode is proposed as the core electrode of wearable bioelectronics. Significantly, the high degree of intrinsic stress dissipation is realized via an amino acid crosslink. The canonical phenolic amino acid (i.e., tyrosine) of silk fibroin is engineered to bridge the secondary structures. A sufficient crosslink network is constructed when tyrosine is exposed near the amorphous strand. The stress dissipative tyrosine crosslink affords 12.5-fold increments of toughness (4.72 to 58.9 MJ m-3 ) and implements the elastoplastic silk fibroin. The harmony of elastoplastic core electrodes with shell fabrics enables the wearable bioelectronics to employ mechanical performance (elastoplasticity of 750 MJ m-3 ) and stable electrical response. The proposed wearable is capable of assisting the effective workouts via triboelectricity. In principle, active mobility with suggested wearables potentially relieves muscular fatigues and severe injuries during daily fitness."
1463,"An empirical investigation between CO2 emission, energy consumption, trade liberalization and economic growth: A case of Kuwait","Wasti, Syed Khurram Arslan; Zaidi, Shumaila Waqar","The purpose of the present study is to investigate the link among CO2 emissions, energy consumption, gross domestic product, and trade liberalization as related to Kuwait. The study used annual data, starting from 1971 to 2017, which was obtained from a world development indicator of the World Bank. For the empirical analysis, the study adopted Augmented Dicky Fuller and Phillips-Perron methods to review stationarity among the data sets. Their results explained a mixed trend, some variables followed the I (1) process, and few are I (0). Based on the findings, a well-defined Autoregressive Distributed Lag Model was applied to the data sets and the outcome was in support of the long and short-run relationship between variables. Carbon dioxide and energy consumption accelerate economic growth; an increase in CO2 emission also plays a significant role in increasing energy consumption. Furthermore, the Granger Causality test shows evidence of bi-directional causality existing between CO2 emissions and energy consumption. A unidirectional causality is running from the gross domestic product to CO2 emissions and energy consumption to trade liberalization."

This study examined the transcriptomic profiles of contour and flight feather follicles from two duck breeds to determine the molecular network and the candidate genes associated with contour and flight feather morphogenesis.2. High-throughput RNA sequencing was performed to compare differences in feather follicles between contour and flight feathers in two duck breeds (Heiwu and Nonghua duck).3. Comparing the contour feather follicles with flight feather follicles, 4,757 and 4,820 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified in Heiwu and Nonghua duck respectively. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) was used to construct a gene co-expression network of all DEGs and identify the key modules and hub genes associated with feather morphogenesis.4. Two key modules were enriched in many pathways involved in feather morphogenesis, such as the Wnt signalling pathway, anatomical structure morphogenesis, and focal adhesion. The CCNA2, TTK, NUF2, ECT2 and INCENP (in one module), and PRSS23, LAMC1, IGFBP3, SHISA5, and APLP2 (in another module) may be essential candidate genes for influencing feather morphology. Moreover, seven transcription factors (TFs) (UBP1, MBD2, ZNF512B, SMAD1, CAPN15, JDP2, KLF10, and MEF2A) were predicted to regulate the essential genes that contribute to feather morphogenesis.5. This work demonstrated gene expression changes of contour and flight feather follicles and is beneficial for further understanding of the complex structure of feathers."

On the above highlight, the present study explores the dynamic interaction between hydroelectricity energy, renewable energy consumption, nonrenewable energy consumption on economic growth over annual time frequency data from 1990 to 2018. To this end, Kao co-integration technique is adopted in conjunction with panel ordinary least squares, dynamic ordinary least squares, and fully modified ordinary least square estimators over the identified blocs while the heterogeneous causality test of Dumitrescu and Hurlin is employed to detect the direction of causality among the variables. Empirical result shows long-run analysis reveals long-run equilibrium relationship between the examined variables. Furthermore, a one-way causality relationship is observed between economic growth and nonrenewable energy, economic growth and renewable energy, and economic growth and pollutant emission. The present study identifies a U-shaped pattern among nonrenewable energy consumption and economic growth in the long-run. These findings suggest that as economic growth increases, there is less strengthening of energy from the nonrenewable energy consumption hence, portentous deterioration in nonrenewable usage while authenticating the proficiency of nonrenewable energy consumption in the E7 countries. Further policy prescriptions are rendered in the concluding section."
1466,Prehospital Drug Assisted Airway Management: An NAEMSP Position Statement and Resource Document,"Jeffrey L Jarvis,John W Lyng,Brian L Miller,Michael C Perlmutter,Heidi Abraham,Ritu Sahni,Jeffrey L Jarvis,John W Lyng,Brian L Miller,Michael C Perlmutter,Heidi Abraham,Ritu Sahni","Airway management is a critical intervention for patients with airway compromise, respiratory failure, and cardiac arrest. Many EMS agencies use drug-assisted airway management (DAAM) - the administration of sedatives alone or in combination with neuromuscular blockers - to facilitate advanced airway placement in patients with airway compromise or impending respiratory failure who also have altered mental status, agitation, or intact protective airway reflexes. While DAAM provides several benefits including improving laryngoscopy and making insertion of endotracheal tubes and supraglottic airways easier, DAAM also carries important risks. NAEMSP recommends:DAAM is an appropriate tool for EMS clinicians in systems with clear guidelines, sufficient training, and close EMS physician oversight. DAAM should not be used in settings without adequate resources.EMS physicians should develop clinical guidelines informed by evidence and oversee the training and credentialing for safe and effective DAAM.DAAM programs should include best practices of airway management including patient selection, assessmenct and positioning, preoxygenation strategies including apneic oxygenation, monitoring and management of physiologic abnormalities, selection of medications, post-intubation analgesia and sedation, equipment selection, airway confirmation and monitoring, and rescue airway techniques.Post-DAAM airway placement must be confirmed and continually monitored with waveform capnography.EMS clinicians must have the necessary equipment and training to manage patients with failed DAAM, including bag mask ventilation, supraglottic airway devices and surgical airway approaches.Continuous quality improvement for DAAM must include assessment of individual and aggregate performance metrics. Where available for review, continuous physiologic recordings (vital signs, pulse oximetry, and capnography), audio and video recordings, and assessment of patient outcomes should be part of DAAM continuous quality improvement."

Shahria","Concrete bridge piers with conventional steel reinforcing bars are vulnerable to strong earthquakes by inducing significant residual deformations, which substantially weakens the seismic resilience of bridges. Superelastic shape memory alloy (SMA) bars showing superior self-centering capacities are desirable substitutes to steel reinforcements to minimize the seismically-induced residual deformations of piers. Nevertheless, high cost, difficult machining, and lack of sufficient energy dissipation are the primary restraining factors to a wide implementation of SMA reinforcements. This study proposes a novel SMA-steel coupled reinforcement for concrete bridge piers, which is intended to achieve the balance between self-centering and energy dissipation capacities. Probabilistic seismic fragility analyses are conducted on the prototype bridge with either pure steel, SMA-steel coupled, or pure SMA reinforcements to evaluate their probability of damage at different limit states. Seismic loss analyses are further performed to compare the relative cost-effectiveness of different patterns of reinforcements. The results indicate that an optimal amount ratio between SMA and steel bars can be found for the coupled reinforcements, which shows lower vulnerabilities and higher resilience under earthquakes than the other reinforcement patterns. The direct repair loss and the indirect downtime loss after earthquakes are considerably reduced when the SMA reinforcing bars are introduced. The coupled reinforcement with the optimal SMA-steel amount ratio shows the most effectiveness in mitigating the long-term economic impacts induced by seismic hazards within the lifetime of the bridge."
1468,An Evaluation Model of Quantitative and Qualitative Fuzzy Multi-Criteria Decision-Making Approach for Hydroelectric Plant Location Selection,"Chien, Fengsheng; Wang, Chia-Nan; Viet Tinh Nguyen; Van Thanh Nguyen; Chau, Ka Yin","Over the past few decades, Vietnam has been one of the fastest growing economies in Asia, experiencing a GDP growth rate of more than 6% per year. The energy industry plays an important role in Vietnam's continuous development, so access to reliable and low-cost energy sources will be an important factor for sustainable economic growth. Achieving the goal of reducing global greenhouse gas emissions, as set out in the Paris agreement on climate change, will depend heavily on the development roadmap of emerging economies, such as Vietnam. Currently, developing hydroelectric plants is Vietnam's optimal choice in order to meet its target of renewable energy development. Hydroelectricity in Vietnam is favorable thanks to the high average annual rainfall, about 1800-2000 mm, and the dense river system, with more than 3450 systems. In addition to providing electricity, hydropower plants are also responsible for cutting and fighting floods for downstream areas in the rainy season, at the same time providing water for production and people's daily needs in the dry season. This work proposes the application of a multicriteria decision-making (MCDM) model to select the best option for the installation of river hydroelectric plants in Vietnam. The use of MCDM techniques in environmental decision-making, including selecting between various alternatives, is important when this involves complex decisions in several disciplinary fields. The most widely used of these techniques are the fuzzy analytical network process (FANP) and the technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS). As a result, Nghe An (LOC05) is found to be the optimal solution for selecting river portions where hydroelectric plants are viable in Vietnam."

S.","Industrial production and commercialization of biodiesel from microalgae have become a good alternative to conventional feedstock. Microalgae show high growth rate and carbon sequestration and can be easily cultivate in fresh and/or marine water, using non-arable soil. This study aims to analyze the technical and economic feasibility of biodiesel production from Phaeodactylum tricornutum, using an algae biomass production scaled-up scenario, considering local reality prices and available technologies. The model assumes 80,000 m(3) of microalgae cultivation, in a set of bubble column photobioreactors installed on 15.247 ha of land, reaching a total of 1,811 tons of microalgae biomass and 171,705 L of biodiesel per year. The production cost estimated for microalgae biomass is 2.01 (sic) kg(-1) and for biodiesel is 0.33 (sic) L-1. The ROI calculated for the project is 10% with a 10 years' payback time and an EBITDA of 588,139 (sic) year(-1). Despite the project's viability in the medium term, the cost of producing microalgae biodiesel remains high when compared to fossil fuels. Thus, unless greater technological maturity is achieved to make the process more economical, it will not be viable in the short term. (C) 2020 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd."

In the present study, meteorological data have been employed to compute the Weibull distribution function as well as wind power and energy density. The wind data measured at 10-min intervals at three heights of 10, 30, and 40 m above the ground. Monthly, seasonal, and annual wind speed variations are analyzed, and the performance of the selected wind turbines is evaluated. The results show that the highest wind power potential occurs in July at Lotak and in August at Shandol. The estimated annual power and energy densities demonstrated that both investigated sites are suitable for large-scale power generation. Finally, the levelized cost of energy (LCOE) is employed to evaluate the economic feasibility of electricity generation from wind power energy. It was demonstrated that the minimum cost of energy achieved by Dongfang DF100-2500 model with LCOE of 0.0830 and 0.0786 USD/kWh in Lotak and Shandol, respectively."

Pneumonitis of coronavirus etiology transforms saturated phospholipids of surfactant into a solid-ordered phase, which disrupts surface tension, alveolar pneumatization, and alveolar-capillary gas exchange. Using molecular modeling (B3LYP/lanl2dz; GAUSSIAN09), we demonstrated that Xe atom due to the van der Waals dispersion interaction increases the distance between the phospholipid acyl chains providing a phase transition from the solid-ordered to liquid phase and restored the surface-active monolayer surfactant film. A clinical case confirmed that short-term inhalations of the Xe and O2 gas mixture relieved manifestations of ventilation insufficiency and increased SpO2 and pneumatization of the terminal parts of the lungs."
1472,The connection between urbanization and carbon emissions: a panel evidence from West Africa,"Musah, Mohammed; Kong, Yusheng; Mensah, Isaac Adjei; Antwi, Stephen Kwadwo; Donkor, Mary","This study examined the nexus between urbanization and carbon emissions in West Africa. Second-generation econometric techniques that are robust to cross-sectional dependence and slope heterogeneity were used for the study. From the Pesaran-Yamagata homogeneity test, the slope coefficients were heterogeneous in nature. Also, the Breusch-Pagan LM test, the Pesaran scaled LM test, bias-corrected LM test, Pesaran CD test and the Friedman's test confirmed the studied panels to be cross-sectionally dependent. Further, the CADF and the CIPS unit root tests established the variables to be first-differenced stationary. Additionally, the Westerlund and Edgerton bootstrap cointegration test and the Pedroni residual cointegration test affirmed the series to be cointegrated in the long run. The Driscoll-Kraay standard errors regression estimator was employed to examine the long-run equilibrium relationship amid the series, and from the results, urbanization had a significantly positive influence on CO2 emissions in all the three panels. Also, economic growth had a materially positive effect on CO2 emissions, while renewable energy consumption had a substantially negative impact on CO2 emissions in all the panels. The causal connections amid the series were finally explored through the Dumitrescu-Hurlin panel causality test, and the discoveries were a bit varied across the various panels. Policy recommendations are further discussed."

The concept of demand response (DR) is extended to IES, and a double objective operation optimization model of IES considering integrated demand response (IDR) mechanism is proposed. Firstly, based on the electro-thermal IES, this paper proposes a demand response mechanism considering electric load and thermal load. According to the load composition (transferable load, reducible load, adjustable thermal load), the load management strategy is established. Then, based on the DR mechanism of electro-thermal IES, a multi-objective operation optimization model is established for the first time, which takes the economic benefits and comprehensive energy efficiency as the objective function. The model involves the equipment constraint in the process of energy production and energy transmission. The relationship between total operation cost and comprehensive energy efficiency of electro-thermal IES is analyzed in the part of Data, Simulation Results and Analysis. Finally, the results show that the model effectively improves the economic benefits and comprehensive energy efficiency of IES, and reduces the pollutants emissions to a certain extent.

1474,The exploitation of host autophagy and ubiquitin machinery by Mycobacterium tuberculosis in shaping immune responses and host defense during infection,"Mohd Shariq,Neha Quadir,Anwar Alam,Sheeba Zarin,Javaid A Sheikh,Neha Sharma,Jasmine Samal,Uzair Ahmad,Indu Kumari,Seyed E Hasnain,Nasreen Z Ehtesham,Mohd Shariq,Neha Quadir,Anwar Alam,Sheeba Zarin,Javaid A Sheikh,Neha Sharma,Jasmine Samal,Uzair Ahmad,Indu Kumari,Seyed E Hasnain,Nasreen Z Ehtesham","Intracellular pathogens have evolved various efficient molecular armaments to subvert innate defenses. Cellular ubiquitination, a normal physiological process to maintain homeostasis, is emerging one such exploited mechanism. Ubiquitin (Ub), a small protein modifier, is conjugated to diverse protein substrates to regulate many functions. Structurally diverse linkages of poly-Ub to target proteins allow enormous functional diversity with specificity being governed by evolutionarily conserved enzymes (E3-Ub ligases). The Ub-binding domain (UBD) and LC3-interacting region (LIR) are critical features of macroautophagy/autophagy receptors that recognize Ub-conjugated on protein substrates. Emerging evidence suggests that E3-Ub ligases unexpectedly protect against intracellular pathogens by tagging poly-Ub on their surfaces and targeting them to phagophores. Two E3-Ub ligases, PRKN and SMURF1, provide immunity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tb). Both enzymes conjugate K63 and K48-linked poly-Ub to M. tb for successful delivery to phagophores. Intriguingly, M. tb exploits virulence factors to effectively dampen host-directed autophagy utilizing diverse mechanisms. Autophagy receptors contain LIR-motifs that interact with conserved Atg8-family proteins to modulate phagophore biogenesis and fusion to the lysosome. Intracellular pathogens have evolved a vast repertoire of virulence effectors to subdue host-immunity via hijacking the host ubiquitination process. This review highlights the xenophagy-mediated clearance of M. tb involving host E3-Ub ligases and counter-strategy of autophagy inhibition by M. tb using virulence factors. The role of Ub-binding receptors and their mode of autophagy regulation is also explained. We also discuss the co-opting and utilization of the host Ub system by M. tb for its survival and virulence.Abbreviations: APC: anaphase promoting complex/cyclosome; ATG5: autophagy related 5; BCG: bacille Calmette-Guerin; C2: Ca2+-binding motif; CALCOCO2: calcium binding and coiled-coil domain 2; CUE: coupling of ubiquitin conjugation to ER degradation domains; DUB: deubiquitinating enzyme; GABARAP: GABA type A receptor-associated protein; HECT: homologous to the E6-AP carboxyl terminus; IBR: in-between-ring fingers; IFN: interferon; IL1B: interleukin 1 beta; KEAP1: kelch like ECH associated protein 1; LAMP1: lysosomal associated membrane protein 1; LGALS: galectin; LIR: LC3-interacting region; MAPK11/p38: mitogen-activated protein kinase 11; MAP1LC3/LC3: microtubule associated protein 1 light chain 3; MAP3K7/TAK1: mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase 7; MAPK8/JNK: mitogen-activated protein kinase 8; MHC-II: major histocompatibility complex-II; MTOR: mechanistic target of rapamycin kinase; NBR1: NBR1 autophagy cargo receptor; NFKB1/p50: nuclear factor kappa B subunit 1; OPTN: optineurin; PB1: phox and bem 1; PE/PPE: proline-glutamic acid/proline-proline-glutamic acid; PknG: serine/threonine-protein kinase PknG; PRKN: parkin RBR E3 ubiquitin protein ligase; RBR: RING-in between RING; RING: really interesting new gene; RNF166: RING finger protein 166; ROS: reactive oxygen species; SMURF1: SMAD specific E3 ubiquitin protein ligase 1; SQSTM1: sequestosome 1; STING1: stimulator of interferon response cGAMP interactor 1; TAX1BP1: Tax1 binding protein 1; TBK1: TANK binding kinase 1; TNF: tumor necrosis factor; TRAF6: TNF receptor associated factor 6; Ub: ubiquitin; UBA: ubiquitin-associated; UBAN: ubiquitin-binding domain in ABIN proteins and NEMO; UBD: ubiquitin-binding domain; UBL: ubiquitin-like; ULK1: unc-51 like autophagy activating kinase 1."
1475,Mangrove Rehabilitation and Restoration as Experimental Adaptive Management,"Ellison, Aaron M.; Felson, Alexander J.; Friess, Daniel A.","Rehabilitated and restored mangrove ecosystems have important ecological, economic, and social values for coastal communities. Although a sine qua non of successful mangrove rehabilitation or restoration projects is accurate attention to local hydrology and basic biology of mangrove trees and their associated fauna, their long-term success depends on far more axes, each with their own challenges. Rehabilitation projects: are planned, designed, executed, and managed by people with diverse backgrounds and different scientific and socio-political agendas; need to be responsive to these multiple stakeholders and agents who hold different values; are often influenced by laws and treaties spanning local to international scales; and must be able to adapt and evolve both geomorphologically and socioeconomically over decades-to-centuries in the context of a rapidly changing climate. We view these challenges as opportunities for innovative approaches to rehabilitation and restoration that engage new and larger constituencies. Restored mangrove ecosystems can be deliberately designed and engineered to provide valuable ecosystem services, be adaptable to climatic changes, and to develop platforms for educating nonspecialists about both the successes and failures of restored mangrove ecosystems. When mangrove rehabilitation or restoration projects are developed as experiments, they can be used as case-studies and more general models to inform policy- and decision-makers and guide future restoration efforts. Achieving this vision will require new investment and dedication to research and adaptive management practices. These ideas are illustrated with examples from mangrove restoration and rehabilitation projects in the Indo-West Pacific and Caribbean regions, the two hotspots of mangrove biodiversity and its ongoing loss and degradation."
1476,"Life cycle energy, emissions and cost evaluation of CO2 air source heat pump system to replace traditional heating methods for residential heating in China: System configurations","Dai, Baomin; Qi, Haifeng; Dou, Wanbin; Liu, Shengchun; Zhong, Dan; Yang, Haining; Nian, Victor; Hao, Ying","Heat pump is an efficient method to substitute traditional boilers for cleaner space heating. A new configuration of CO2 heat pump system integrated with vapor injection and dedicated mechanical subcooling (VIDMS) is proposed, and compared with five configurations of CO2 heat pump system and three traditional heating methods. The life cycle model of energy consumption, pollutant emissions, and economic performance is developed. Assessment is conducted by taking seven typical cities located in different climate regions of China as scenarios. Coefficient of performance (COP) of VIDMS system is superior to other transcritical CO2 systems, and the COP is enhanced more notably in the case of severe cold or cold regions. The COP reaches up to 2.13 at the low ambient temperature of - 20 degrees C, 36.51% higher than the baseline (BASE) CO2 system. The primary energy consumption (PEC) of the other five CO2 systems and coal-fired boiler (CFB) can decrease by 4.15-18.26% and 19.27%, respectively, when VIDMS is adopted. Moreover, the PEC reduction is more prominent when used in severe cold region. Life cycle climate performance (LCCP) decreases significantly by employing VIDMS compared with other transcritical CO2 systems and traditional heating methods. CO2 emissions can be reduced by 13.81-23.20% and 16.56-34.31% in contrast to BASE and CFB, respectively. Furthermore, the gaseous (NOx and SO2) and particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10) emissions also decrease. Life cycle cost (LCC) by using VIDMS is much lower than the other transcritical CO2 systems. The payback period is reduced from 5.58 to 3.55 years if the price of electricity and CO2 compressor are both reduced by 20%. The new proposed VIDMS is a more promising CO2 heat pump solution to replace traditional heating methods."
1477,Post-pandemic citizenship: The next phase of global citizenship education,"Evan Saperstein,Evan Saperstein","As globalization has grown, the concept of ""global citizenship"" has also evolved. The drive to expand citizenship beyond national borders spurred a nascent discipline known as global citizenship education (GCE). This article examines the continuum from globalization, to global citizenship, to a global pandemic (Covid-19)-and how the lessons from this growing age of globalism can serve as a blueprint for a new form of global citizenship following the pandemic, defined as ""post-pandemic citizenship"". The first part chronicles the drive toward globalization since the second half of the 20th century. The second part details the defining traits of global citizenship. The third part calls for a new form of global citizenship that should become part of GCE and be included in global-studies-related secondary-school courses and curricula in the wake of Covid-19-a so-called post-pandemic citizenship education (PPCE)-that emphasizes public health, empathy and compassion, self-sacrifice, and cooperative spirit."
1478,The future(s) of digital agriculture and sustainable food systems: An analysis of high-level policy documents,"Lajoie-O'Malley, Alana; Bronson, Kelly; van der Burg, Simone; Klerkx, Laurens","Ecosystem services delivery is influenced by food systems and vice versa. As the application of digital technologies in agriculture continues to expand, digital technologies might affect the delivery of ecosystem services in view of the sorts of food systems in which they are embedded. The direction food systems develop towards the future, and the role digital technologies play in this development, is influenced by imaginings, hopes and visions about what these technologies mean for future food systems. In this article, we investigate what roles are being imagined for these technologies by international actors with the ability to influence the future of food systems. We analyze outward-facing policy documents as well as conference proceedings on digital agriculture produced by the World Bank, the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO), and the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). Using qualitative textual analysis, we show that these organisations envision future food systems that prioritize maximizing food output through technology. We illustrate how this vision reflects a long-standing narrative about the role of technology in food systems innovation, which makes the controversial assumption that increases in food production lead to improvements in food security. Based on this finding, we suggest that evaluations of how digital agricultural technologies might affect the delivery of ecosystem services must begin by considering what visions of future food systems are take into account in science, technology development and policy making. Supporting similar research on high-level narratives surrounding agroecology and climate smart agriculture, we find that the dominant narrative in our dataset supports the status quo global, industrial agriculture and food system. This system continues to be criticized by many scholars for its environmental impacts. Based on our findings, we suggest that ecosystems service researchers could contribute substantially to the evaluation of environmental impacts of digital agriculture by analyzing the impact digital agriculture may have on the trade-offs between provisioning, regulatory, and cultural ecosystem services for several different food system futures. Such analyses can feed into processes of responsible innovation."
1479,Does pollution-intensive industrial agglomeration increase residents' health expenditure?,"Li, He; Lu, Juan; Li, Bin","Pollution-intensive industrial agglomeration has become a trend of industrial distribution in China. Does pollution-intensive industrial agglomeration significantly increase residents' health expenditure? By clarifying the environmental effect, economic effect and public service effect of pollution-intensive industrial agglomeration on residents' health expenditure, this paper combined with provincial data to prove the environmental effect, economic effect and public service effect. The results show that: (1) Every 1 % increase in pollution-intensive industries will reduce rural residents' health expenditure by 1.1844 % and increase the health expenditure of urban residents by 1.206 %. (2) The pollution-intensive industrial agglomeration increases the health expenditure by expanding the scale of pollution, reduces the health expenditure by promoting the technological innovation. (3) Pollution-intensive industrial agglomeration increases the health expenditure by enhancing residents' income and reduces the health expenditure by enhancing employment rate. (4) Pollution-intensive industrial agglomeration increases the health expenditure by improving medical services and reduces the residents' health expenditure by promoting the construction of environmental infrastructure. (5) There are a single threshold and a double threshold effects of pollution-intensive industrial agglomeration on health expenditure of rural residents and urban residents, respectively. When the location entropy is higher than 0.4669, the pollutionintensive industrial agglomeration can reduce residents' health expenditure. When the location entropy is less than 0.9861 or greater than 1.027, the pollution-intensive industrial agglomeration increases urban residents' health expenditure. The conclusion of this paper is of great significance in adjusting the distribution of pollution-intensive industries and increasing the health expenditure of residents."

The stability of the proposed model is proved and the new model can obtain higher prediction accuracy through three cases. And it was applied to the prediction of the non-renewable energy consumption in Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation. It proves that discrete grey model with adjacent accumulation is effective. According to the forecasting results, the oil consumptions in 15 countries have an increasing trend. The coal consumptions of five countries (South Korea, Indonesia, Vietnam, Malaysia and the Philippines) show a clear growth trend and The United States, Canada and Australia all show a downward trend. The consumptions of natural gas in the United States, Mexico, Singapore, China, Vietnam and Peru will all increase. For nuclear energy, China's consumption will increase and South Korea's consumption will decrease. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."
1481,Integrated analysis of energy-economic development-environmental sustainability nexus: Case study of MENA countries,"Ibrahim, Mustapha D.; Alola, Andrew Adewale","The new industrialization necessitates the integration of energy efficiency, economic development, and environmental sustainability. However, quantifying the efficiency of renewable energy towards economic development is an ongoing debate. On this basis, this study presents a multi net-put efficiency and conventional efficiency approach to analyze non-renewable energy and renewable energy efficiency towards economic development and environmental sustainability nexus. Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) is utilized to estimate multi net-put conventional and renewable energy efficiency. Likewise, the Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) Pooled Mean Group (PMG) approach is applied to examine the impact of non-renewable efficiency on economic growth, total natural resource rent and environmental quality. Results show that the efficiency nexus of conventional energy is significant and higher (98%) than renewable energy (69.5%) for the evaluated period (2006-2016). None-theless, conventional energy efficiency of the panel of MENA countries worsen the environmental quality, thus does not enhance environmental sustainability especially in the long-run. The results also posit that economic growth in the panel of MENA countries is detrimental to the region's environmental sustainability. Further analysis indicates that the inefficiency of renewable energy nexus has more to do with scale size inadequacy rather than operational deficiency. Therefore, resources and policies must be targeted towards up scaling renewable energy capacity accompanied with cautious and target oriented strategy. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."
1482,Effects of heterogeneous technological progress on haze pollution: Evidence from China,"Yi, Ming; Wang, Yiqian; Sheng, Mingyue; Sharp, Basil; Zhang, Yao","Technological progress plays an important role in combating haze pollution in the long run. However, existing studies often ignore the inconsistent effects on the reduction of haze brought by different types of technological progress. Considering the potential heterogeneity among technological progress, this paper constructs a theoretical framework to analyse the impact of heterogeneous technological progress on haze pollution, using annual data from 30 provinces and cities in China for the period of 2003 to 2016. A systematic GMM method is applied to empirically test the effects of neutral technological progress and biased technological progress on haze pollution. The results show that first, due to cost-reduction effect and income effect, neutral technological progress and labour-saving technological progress are conducive to haze reduction; while the impact of capital-saving technological progress on haze pollution is insignificant. Second, because of the energy rebound effect, energy-saving technological progress cannot effectively reduce haze pollution. Third, the haze-reduction effects of different types of technological progress show significant regional heterogeneity in China. Last, in terms of the control variables, strengthening environmental regulation is the only factor that can be helpful in haze reduction, others intensify haze pollution."

In the system concentrated solar energy collected with dish optical configuration is used to generate high temperature steam, which acts as a gasification agent to drive the biomass gasification. When solar radiation intensity is lower than the design point (the maximum in whole year), the hybrid steam/air biomass gasification model is conducted for continuous syngas production. Syngas based chemical energy is released for trigeneration in a distributed system. The reaction kinetics models of steam-biomass gasification using solar energy are developed and the thermodynamics performances of the system are numerical investigated. Under the designate conditions, the primary energy efficiency reaches 51.34%. Based on the local weather data, the off-design performances of the system and the annual energy-saving potential are evaluated. Compared with the reference system that combines a conventional air biomass gasification trigeneration system and a solar dish/Stirling engine system, the new system has remarkable advantage in thermal performances. An economic analysis is conducted to evaluate the technical feasibility of the proposed system. This, research provides a promising method for the efficient utilization of biomass and solar energy."
1484,Differential Expression of Long Non-Coding RNAs and Their Role in Rodent Neuropathic Pain Models,"Songchao Xu,He Dong,Yang Zhao,Wei Feng,Songchao Xu,He Dong,Yang Zhao,Wei Feng","Neuropathic pain, which is accompanied by an unpleasant sensation, affects the patient's quality of life severely. Considering the complexity of the neuropathic pain, there are huge unmet medical needs for it while current effective therapeutics remain far from satisfactory. Accordingly, exploration of mechanisms of neuropathic pain could provide new therapeutic insights. While numerous researches have pointed out the contribution of sensory neuron-immune cell interactions, other mechanisms of action, such as long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), also could contribute to the neuropathic pain observed in vivo. LncRNAs have more than 200 nucleotides and were originally considered as transcriptional byproducts. However, recent studies have suggested that lncRNAs played a significant role in gene regulation and disease pathogenesis. A substantial number of long non-coding RNAs were expressed differentially in neuropathic pain models. Besides, therapies targeting specific lncRNAs can significantly ameliorate the development of neuropathic pain, which reveals the contribution of lncRNAs in the generation and maintenance of neuropathic pain and provides a new therapeutic strategy. The primary purpose of this review is to introduce recent studies of lncRNAs on different neuropathic pain models."

In this observational study, we recorded spontaneous aggression among captive juvenile pheasants (Phasianus colchicus) alongside infrared thermographic measurements of their external temperature, a non-invasive technique previously used to examine stress responses in non-social contexts, where peripheral blood is redirected towards the body core. We found low but highly significant repeatability in maximum head temperature, suggesting individually consistent thermal profiles, and some indication of lower head temperatures in more active behavioural states (e.g. walking compared to resting). These individual differences were partly associated with sex, females being cooler on average than males, but unrelated to body size. During pairwise aggressive encounters, we observed a non-monotonic temperature change, with head temperature dropping rapidly immediately prior to an attack and increasing rapidly afterwards, before returning to baseline levels. This nonlinear pattern was similar for birds in aggressor and recipient roles, but aggressors were slightly hotter on average. Our findings show that aggressive interactions induce rapid temperature changes in dominants and subordinates alike, and highlight infrared thermography as a promising tool for investigating the physiological basis of pecking orders in galliforms. This article is part of the theme issue 'The centennial of the pecking order: current state and future prospects for the study of dominance hierarchies'."
1486,Impacts of COVID-19 on Trade and Economic Aspects of Food Security: Evidence from 45 Developing Countries,"Erokhin, Vasilii; Gao, Tianming","The stability of food supply chains is crucial to the food security of people around the world. Since the beginning of 2020, this stability has been undergoing one of the most vigorous pressure tests ever due to the COVID-19 outbreak. From a mere health issue, the pandemic has turned into an economic threat to food security globally in the forms of lockdowns, economic decline, food trade restrictions, and rising food inflation. It is safe to assume that the novel health crisis has badly struck the least developed and developing economies, where people are particularly vulnerable to hunger and malnutrition. However, due to the recency of the COVID-19 problem, the impacts of macroeconomic fluctuations on food insecurity have remained scantily explored. In this study, the authors attempted to bridge this gap by revealing interactions between the food security status of people and the dynamics of COVID-19 cases, food trade, food inflation, and currency volatilities. The study was performed in the cases of 45 developing economies distributed to three groups by the level of income. The consecutive application of the autoregressive distributed lag method, Yamamoto's causality test, and variance decomposition analysis allowed the authors to find the food insecurity effects of COVID-19 to be more perceptible in upper-middle-income economies than in the least developed countries. In the latter, food security risks attributed to the emergence of the health crisis were mainly related to economic access to adequate food supply (food inflation), whereas in higher-income developing economies, availability-sided food security risks (food trade restrictions and currency depreciation) were more prevalent. The approach presented in this paper contributes to the establishment of a methodology framework that may equip decision-makers with up-to-date estimations of health crisis effects on economic parameters of food availability and access to staples in food-insecure communities."
1487,"Households' Willingness to Accept Improved Ecosystem Services and Influencing Factors: Application of Contingent Valuation Method in Bashang Plateau, Hebei Province, China","Chu, Xi; Zhan, Jinyan; Wang, Chao; Hameeda, Sultan; Wang, Xiaoru","The Bashang Plateau, which is an ecologically fragile agro-pastoral zone in Hebei Province in China, plays an important role in protecting the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region from wind and sand erosion. Over the last four decades, it has been the target of extensive afforestation campaigns to promote improved ecosystem services. Though the benefits and costs of afforestation and its effectiveness within forestry have been widely investigated, few studies have focused on local households' willingness to accept (WTA) compensation relating to afforestation policies. Moreover, despite their importance in ensuring effective afforestation policies, the factors influencing WTA values have seldom been examined. We administered a direct questionnaire survey of households on the Bashang Plateau and applied a contingent valuation analysis to estimate their WTA values for compensation associated with ecological protection policies. We obtained 249 valid questionnaires, evidencing a high response rate (92.22%). New indicators of factors influencing respondents' WTA has been conducted including social, economic and ecological aspects, especially the improvement of ecological factors which consists of respondents' perceptions regarding the importance of ES and their satisfaction levels, and other environmental awareness factors. Additionally, in the case where many studies performed only one single regression analysis, this study performed a two-stage regression analysis and compared the results with those obtained using the Tobit model. A reasonable compensation standard facilitates a positive relationship between economic development and protection of natural environments. The findings showed that a certain amount of compensation (approximately 477.91 CNY/mu/year) was likely to prompt households' participation in afforestation projects. Compared with compensation standards for other ecological projects, the reported standard for afforestation projects on the Bashang Plateau is low, indicating that there is room for improvement. High annual household incomes are a key factor influencing households' WTA regarding their participation in afforestation activities. The results also revealed households' environmental awareness. Among respondents who participated in afforestation, those who valued forests for protecting environments and improving ecosystem services opted for lower compensation amounts. Our findings contribute valuable inputs for formulating ecological compensation standards and can serve as a reference for analyses of WTA and factors that drive it in other similar economically backward and ecologically fragile regions."

Twenty-nine young females were assigned into three groups and performed 10 weeks (2 training sessions per week) of either 3 (LV), 6 (MV) or 9 (HV) sets/session of four fast velocity eccentric-only half-squats against 70% of concentric 1RM, followed by 3 maximum countermovement jumps (CMJ) after each set. Body composition, vastus lateralis fibre-type composition, and resting blood lipidemic and glycemic indices were evaluated 1 week before and after the training intervention. Significant changes in body composition, fasting glucose, HOMA-IR and blood lipids were found after training with MV and HV (p < 0.05; η2: 0.135-0.390). Significant correlations were found between muscle fibres' percentage cross-sectional areas (%CSA) and resting glycemic-lipid values (r:-0.543to 0.730, p < 0.05). Training-induced changes of glycemic-lipid profiles were highly correlated to those of type IIa and IIx %CSAs (r: -0.895 to 0.898, p < 0.05). Partial Correlations revealed a significant impact of the imposed training volumes on these correlations. These results suggest that six but mostly nine sets per training session of the imposed training stimuli are needed for beneficial changes in resting glycemic-lipidemic profiles, changes which are related to the training-induced changes in muscle fibre composition. However, these relationships are dictated by the imposed training volumes.Highlights Power training induces beneficial changes in body composition, glycemic and lipidemic profiles.Greater training volumes are needed for the healthier changes in glycemic-lipidemic profiles.Higher Type I, IIA and lower IIX percentage cross-sectional areas are linked with healthier body composition and glycemic-lipidemic profiles.Individuals experiencing the greatest increase in Type IIa and decrease in Type IIX muscle fibres cross-sectional areas after power training are those with the greatest beneficial changes in body composition, glycemic and lipidemic profiles."
1489,Optimal sizing and techno-economic analysis of grid-connected nanogrid for tropical climates of the Savannah,"Dahiru, Ahmed Tijjani; Tan, Chee Wei","Reliability and costs are mainly considered in performance analysis of renewable energy-based distributed grids. Hybrid Optimization of Multiple Energy Renewables was used in techno-economic analysis of renewable energy systems involving photovoltaics, wind, diesel and storage in tropical regions of Amazon, Central Asia and Mediterranean. In a study for a Guinea Savannah region, 70% of renewable energy fraction was achieved. However, levelized cost of energy of 0.689 $/kWh was higher than tariff rate of 0.6 $/kWh. This paper considers Hybrid Optimization of Multiple Energy Renewables to achieve lower levelized cost of energy and net present costs of a nanogrid for increased reliability and low per capita energy consumption of 150 kWh in a Sudan Savannah region of Nigeria. The proposed grid connected nanogrid aims to serve daily residential demand of 355 kWh. A range of 0.0110 $/kWh to 0.0095 $/kWh and $366,210 to $288,680 as negative values of levelized cost of energy and net present cost respectively were realized, implying potentials for a large grid export. The renewable energy fraction of up to 98% was also achieved in addition to low greenhouse gas emission of 2,328 tons/year. The results may further be consolidated with strategies for power dispatch and load scheduling."

The AgNPs were subjected for characterizations using UV-Vis, FTIR, TGA, TEM, EDX, XRD, and zeta-potential analyses. The antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Candida albicans, Alternaria alternata, Candida glabrata and Fusarium oxysporum was determined by the agar well diffusion technique. The cytotoxicity of AgNPs against human lung cancer (A549) was studied by MTT and ROS assays and capping of proteins of AgNPs from SDS-PAGE. In the UV-Vis., absorption peak was found at 418 nm, FTIR analysis revealed the infrared bands of specific functional groups from 3273 cm-1 to 428 cm-1; TEM data confirmed the spherical shape, smallest size of particle as 18.99 nm, while EDX analysis confirmed the elemental composition of AgNPs with 22.24% Ag. The XRD pattern confirmed the nature of AgNPs as crystalline, and zeta potential peak was found at -24.6 mV indicating the higher stability. The AgNPs exhibited increased antimicrobial activity with increase in dosage volume and considerable MIC and MBC values against microbial pathogens. In the MTT cytotoxicity assay, the IC50 value of 31.41 μg/mL is obtained against A549 cell line, suggesting the potential of AgNPs to inhibit the tumour cells; and ROS assay displayed increased ROS production with increase in treatment time. Based on the results, it is evident that Streptomyces hirsutus strain SNPGA-8 AgNPs are potentially promising to be applied for biomedical uses."
1491,Immobilized polymeric sulfonated ionic liquid on core-shell structured Fe3O4/SiO2 composites: A magnetically recyclable catalyst for simultaneous transesterification and esterifications of low-cost oils to biodiesel,"Xie, Wenlei; Wang, Hao","In accordance with the need of green and sustainable development, a magnetically recyclable solid catalyst was developed for the transformation of low-cost oils to biodiesel via simultaneous transesterification and esterifications in an efficient and environmentally benign manner. For this aim, the magnetic Fe3O4/SiO2 composites composed of iron oxides as the core and silica as the shell, were prepared, and then polymeric acidic ionic liquid (IL) was immobilized on the magnetic support through radical grafting copolymerization of Bronsted acidic IL, 1-vinyl-3-(3-sulfopropyl)imidazolium hydrogen sulfate, onto the magnetic support. The characterization results showed that the perfect core-shell structured Fe3O4/SiO2 support with good magnetic responsiveness was formed, and the polymeric acidic IL was tethered on the magnetic support. The combination of polymeric acidic IL with magnetic porous nanoparticles could enhance the catalytic activity and favored the separation performance of the catalyst. The solid catalyst exhibited high activities for both transesterification of soybean oil and esterification of free fatty acids generally presented in low-cost oils. Moreover, the catalyst could be simply recovered magnetically and efficiently reutilized for several times without significant loss in its activity, thus allowing its being potentially applicable for green and economic production of biodiesel especially from the low-cost oil feedstocks.

The characterization results indicated that a more irregular surface with new empty spaces was generated after acid treatment. The adsorptive process was favored at acidic pH = 3. The dosage of 0.85 g L-1 was fixed for the kinetic and isothermal tests, obtaining good removal and capacity indications. The kinetic studies were better represented by pseudo-second-order, obtaining an experimental capacity of 74.3 mg g-1 for 200 mg L-1 of ketoprofen. An increase in temperature negatively affected the adsorption isotherm curves, resulting in a maximum capacity of 194.1 mg g-1. Thermodynamic results confirmed the exothermic nature of the process with physical forces acting. The adsorbent presented high efficiency in treating a synthetic effluent containing different drugs and salts, 71.2%. Therefore, adsorbent development from buckwheat husks treated with a strong acid is an excellent alternative, given the good removal results and the low cost for its preparation."

This paper firstly explores the important reasons for the uncoordinated industrial structure caused by haze pollution, and puts forward the purpose of promoting the adjustment of industrial structure through urban governance in order to tackle with the urgent problem of haze pollution. Using panel data from 287 cities in China, this paper analyzes the relationship among industrial structure, urban governance and haze pollution using the Geographically and Temporally Weighted Regression (GTWR) model. The innovations are: (1) this paper focuses on the topic of industrial structure, urban governance and haze pollution simultaneously. (2) this paper uses the method of GTWR to comprehensively consider the spatial and temporal tendency at the same time. (3) Conclusions are helpful to provide targeted policy recommendations. And the results show that: (1) the spatial clustering characteristics of haze pollution are very prominent, and have been suppressed to a certain extent under the measures of urban governance; (2) the spatial and temporal differences of industrial structure on haze pollution are large; (3) corporate governance plays an important role in slowing down haze pollution; (4) in public governance, the green coverage rate of built-up areas, the innocuous disposal rate of domestic garbage and the increase of public transport will have a negative impact on haze pollution, while highly concentrated urban population, high level of economic development, large number of industrial enterprises above designated size, and increased thermal power generation capacity will increase the degree of haze pollution; (5) cities with steadily decreasing of the proportion of the secondary industry, the proportion of the tertiary industry, the comprehensive treatment rate of industrial solid materials, the green coverage rate of the built-up area and the industrial enterprises above designated size are mainly lie in southeastern China, respectively: and cities with decline in innocuous disposal rate of domestic garbage are concentrated in the western region, while cities with significant changes of the number of buses per unit are mainly distributed in the northeastern region, the other variables are not obvious.

Achieving such awareness requires visually compelling geospatial decision-making tools that take into account the probabilistic and spatially distributed nature of water contamination. Inspired by the success of weather maps, this paper presents a novel STochastic Reliability-based Risk Evaluation And Mapping for watershed Systems and Sustainability (STREAMS) tool that produces and effectively communicates the risk of water contamination as maps. STREAMS is integrated with ArcGIS geoprocessing tools and uses physics-based reliability theory to compute the spatial distribution of risk, which is defined as the probability of exceeding a safety threshold of water contamination within a watershed. A quantitative analysis of the efficacy of mitigation strategies is conducted by estimating risk reduction from best management practices throughout the entire watershed. Two case studies at different spatial scales are presented, demonstrating STREAMS application to watersheds with varied properties."
1495,Sustainable and Smart Manufacturing: An Integrated Approach,"Abubakr, Mohamed; Abbas, Adel T.; Tomaz, Italo; Soliman, Mahmoud S.; Luqman, Monis; Hegab, Hussien","The necessity for decreasing the negative impact of the manufacturing industry has recently increased. This is getting recognized as a global challenge due to the rapid increase in life quality standards, demand, and the decrease in available resources. Thus, manufacturing, as a core of the product provision system and a fundamental pillar of civilized existence, is significantly influenced by sustainability issues. Furthermore, current manufacturing modeling and assessment criteria require intensive revisions and upgrades to keep up with these new challenges. Nearly all current manufacturing models are based on the old paradigm, which was proven to be inadequate. Therefore, manufacturing technology, along with culture and economy, are held responsible for providing new tools and opportunities for building novel resolutions towards a sustainable manufacturing concept. One of such tools is sustainability assessment measures. Revising and updating such tools is a core responsibility of the manufacturing sector to efficiently evaluate and enhance sustainable manufacturing performance. These measures should be adequate to respond to the growing sustainability concerns in pursuit of an integrated sustainability concept. The triple bottom line (TBL) that includes environment, economic, and social dimensions has usually been used to evaluate sustainability. However, there is a lack of standard sets of sustainable manufacturing performance measures. In addition to the sustainability concept, a new concept of smart manufacturing is emerging. The smart manufacturing concept takes advantage of the recent technological leap in Artificial Intelligent (AI), Cloud Computing (CC), and the Internet of Things (IoT). Although this concept offers an important step to boost the current production capabilities to meet the growing need, it is still not clear whether the two concepts of smart manufacturing and sustainability will constructively or destructively interact. Therefore, the current study aims to integrate the sustainable smart manufacturing performance by incorporating sustainable manufacturing measures and discussing current and future challenges that are faced by the manufacturing sector. In addition, the opportunities for future research incorporating sustainable smart manufacturing are also presented."

This is a result of significant, measurable changes to the genomes of those animal species and breeds. Genome editing techniques may now be applied to achieve targeted DNA sequence alterations, with the potential to affect traits of interest to production of agricultural animals in just one generation. New opportunities arise to improve characteristics difficult to achieve or not amenable to traditional breeding, including disease resistance, and traits that can improve animal welfare, reduce environmental impact, or mitigate impacts of climate change. Countries and supranational institutions are in the process of defining regulatory approaches for genome edited animals and can benefit from sharing approaches and experiences to institute progressive policies in which regulatory oversight is scaled to the particular level of risk involved. To facilitate information sharing and discussion on animal biotechnology, an international community of researchers, developers, breeders, regulators, and communicators recently held a series of seven virtual workshop sessions on applications of biotechnology for animal agriculture, food and environmental safety assessment, regulatory approaches, and market and consumer acceptance. In this report, we summarize the topics presented in the workshop sessions, as well as discussions coming out of the breakout sessions. This is framed within the context of past and recent scientific and regulatory developments. This is a pivotal moment for determination of regulatory approaches and establishment of trust across the innovation through-chain, from researchers, developers, regulators, breeders, farmers through to consumers."
1497,Management of status epilepticus: a narrative review,"I Migdady,E S Rosenthal,H R Cock,I Migdady,E S Rosenthal,H R Cock","Status epilepticus causes prolonged or repetitive seizures that, if left untreated, can lead to neuronal injury, severe disability, coma and death in paediatric and adult populations. While convulsive status epilepticus can be diagnosed using clinical features alone, non-convulsive status epilepticus requires confirmation by electroencephalogram. Early seizure control remains key in preventing the complications of status epilepticus. This is especially true for convulsive status epilepticus, which has stronger evidence supporting the benefit of treatment on outcomes. When status epilepticus becomes refractory, often due to gamma-aminobutyric acid and N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor modulation, anaesthetic drugs are needed to suppress seizure activity, of which there is limited evidence regarding the selection, dose or duration of their use. Seizure monitoring with electroencephalogram is often needed when patients do not return to baseline or during anaesthetic wean; however, it is resource-intensive, costly, only available in highly specialised centres and has not been shown to improve functional outcomes. Thus, the treatment goals and aggressiveness of therapy remain under debate, especially for non-convulsive status epilepticus, where prolonged therapeutic coma can lead to severe complications. This review presents an evidence-based, clinically-oriented and comprehensive review of status epilepticus and its definitions, aetiologies, treatments, outcomes and prognosis at different stages of the patient's journey."
1498,Strategic renewable energy resources selection for Pakistan: Based on SWOT-Fuzzy AHP approach,"Wang, Ying; Xu, Li; Solangi, Yasir Ahmed","Pakistan is facing a severe energy crisis since the last two decades, and yet the government has not been able to overcome this problem. Therefore, the various renewable energy resources of Sindh and Baluchistan province has been assessed to diversify the electricity generation from fossil fuels to renewable energy. In the study, Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats (SWOT) analysis has been employed to assess the internal and external factors which affect the renewable energy technologies in Sindh and Baluchistan province. Then, the Fuzzy Analytical Hierarchy Process (Fuzzy AHP) method is used from the multi-perspective approach (i.e., economic, environmental, technical, and socio-political criteria). Therefore in the study, four criteria, seventeen sub-criteria and three renewable energy resources (i.e., solar, wind, and biomass) have been assessed as alternatives in the decision model. It is identified that economic and socio-political are the two most important criteria. Further results reveal that wind has ample potential to generate electricity in both (Sindh and Baluchistan) provinces, whereas solar and biomass energy ranked second and third, respectively. It is, therefore, suggested that the government should exploit renewable resources to mitigate the current energy crisis and increase energy security for sustainable development of the country."

In this paper, we give an outline of the Programming-Tutor architectural design with the core implements on user interaction. This pilot proposal is for designing a model domain of a subset in the computer programming language. The completed project would be adequate to show the idea of a completely developed computing Intelligent Tutoring System in online programming courses to offer benefits to students in the Pacific. This proposed concept would also provide students with an immersive learning experience in an online course to assist in a formative assessment to enhance student learning. A smart tutoring system can provide prompt input of high quality which not only conveys to students about the consistency of the solution but also provides them with information on the precision of the key concerning their existing solutions expertise. This Intelligent Tutoring System (ITS) is proposed to be designed using intelligent algorithms such as optimized ant colony to be able to support the online tutoring system that can initiate the complex learning principles in computing science courses. It is also hypothesized that, based on the performance of other Intelligent Tutoring Systems, students would be able to learn to program more easily in regional campuses and acquire experiences more rapidly and efficiently than students who are taught using conventional methods in an online mode."

Patients undergoing advanced airway management customarily receive manual ventilations. However, manual ventilation is associated with hypo- and hyperventilation, variable tidal volumes, and barotrauma, among other potential complications. Portable mechanical ventilators offer an important strategy for optimizing ventilation and mitigating ventilatory complications.EMS clinicians, including those performing emergency response as well as interfacility transports, should consider using mechanical ventilation after advanced airway insertion.Prehospital mechanical ventilation techniques, strategies, and parameters should be disease-specific and should mirror in-hospital best practices.EMS clinicians must receive training in the general principles of mechanical ventilation as well as detailed training in the operation of the specific system(s) used by the EMS agency.Patients undergoing mechanical ventilation must receive appropriate sedation and analgesia."

While typological patterns are well-established for monolingual speakers of a variety of languages, relatively less is known about motion expression in bilingual speakers. The current study examined the packaging (expressing each element in separate clauses or within the same clause) and lexical choices (amount and diversity of manner and path verbs) for motion expression in monolingual speakers of Turkish or English and advanced Turkish (L1)-English (L2) bilinguals in a narrative elicitation task. Bilinguals were successful in attaining many English-like patterns of expression in their L2 English but also showed some packaging and lexical choices that were intermediate between English and Turkish monolinguals-thus providing evidence of an L1-to-L2 cross-linguistic effect. Subtle effects of L2 on L1 were also found in bilinguals' lexical choices for the expression of motion in their L1 Turkish. Altogether, our results demonstrate bi-directional transfer effects of learning a typologically distinct language in advanced Turkish-English bilinguals."
1502,Development potential and technical strategy of continental shale oil in China,Hu Suyun; Zhao Wenzhi; Hou Lianhua; Yang Zhi; Zhu Rukai; Wu Songtao; Bai Bin; Jin Xu,"Continental shale oil is a general term for liquid hydrocarbons and many kinds of organic matter in continental organic-rich shale series with vitrinite reflectance of more than 0.5% at buried depth of more than 300 m, and is an important type of source-rock oil and gas. Based on the evolution model of oil generation and expulsion in organic-rich shale series controlled by maturity, continental shale oil is divided into two types: medium-high maturity and medium-low maturity. (1) The continental shale series in China develop high-quality source rocks of freshwater and saltwater lacustrine facies, as well as multiple types of reservoirs, including elastic rocks, carbonate rocks, diamictite, tuff and shale, forming a number of ""sweet sections"" and ""sweet areas"" of continuous distribution inside or near source rocks, which have large scale resources. (2) Experimental analysis of organic rich shale samples shows that the shale samples with wavy and horizontal beddings have good storage conditions, and the horizontal permeability of shale is tens to hundreds of times of its vertical permeability, which is conducive to the lateral migration and accumulation of shale oil in the source rocks. (3) After evaluation, the geological resources of medium-high maturity shale oil are about 10 billion tons, which can be effectively developed by horizontal drilling and volumetric fracturing, and will be a practical field of oil exploration in recent years. Shale oil with medium and low maturity has huge resource potential, and technological recoverable resources of (70-90) billion tons, making it a strategic alternative resource of oil industry. However, economic development of this type of shale oil needs in-situ conversion technology breakthroughs. Continental shale oil is an inevitable choice in the process of Chinese continental petroleum exploration from ""outside source"" to ""inside source"". Making breakthroughs in the core technologies such as ""sweet area"" evaluation and optimization, horizontal well volume fracturing and in-situ conversion technology and equipment is the key to realizing scale development of continental shale oil economically."
1503,Energy vulnerability around the world: The global energy vulnerability index (GEVI),"Gatto, Andrea; Busato, Francesco","Vulnerability has garnered an increasing attention from academia, international community and industry. Nonetheless, formal definition, mainstreaming, and measurement of vulnerability are still flawed in the economic literature. Energy vulnerability, intended as the exposure of an energy system to adverse events and change, often overlaps with other energy policy concepts such as resilience, security, poverty, justice, and sustainability. This paper improves understanding of vulnerability in economics, energy, and sustainability studies by: i) constructing a dataset on energy vulnerability made of 180.000 observations; ii) formally defining energy vulnerability, while considering the regulatory framework and development agenda; iii) building a composite indicator on energy vulnerability; iv) analyzing and ranking the energy vulnerability of a vast number of OECD and non-OECD countries; v) testing for robustness checks. The analysis suggests that GDP is not necessarily a leading driver for energy vulnerability, whilst resource embedment is, since fossil and renewable energy producers are less vulnerable. Eventually, the paper validates that green countries are less vulnerable, differently from cold, heavily-industrialized, and highly-consuming countries. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."
1504,Epigenetic regulation by gut microbiota,"Vivienne Woo,Theresa Alenghat,Vivienne Woo,Theresa Alenghat","The gastrointestinal tract is continuously exposed to trillions of commensal microbes, collectively termed the microbiota, which are environmental stimuli that can direct health and disease within the host. In addition to well-established bacterial sensing pathways, microbial signals are also integrated through epigenetic modifications that calibrate the transcriptional program of host cells without altering the underlying genetic code. Microbiota-sensitive epigenetic changes include modifications to the DNA or histones, as well as regulation of non-coding RNAs. While microbiota-sensitive epigenetic mechanisms have been described in both local intestinal cells and as well in peripheral tissues, further research is required to fully decipher the complex relationship between the host and microbiota. This Review highlights current understandings of epigenetic regulation by gut microbiota and important implications of these findings in guiding therapeutic approaches to prevent or combat diseases driven by impaired microbiota-host interactions."
1505,Oxygen supplementation to limit hypoxia-induced muscle atrophy in C2C12 myotubes: comparison with amino acid supplement and electrical stimulation,"Samir Bensaid,Claudine Fabre,Mehdi Pawlak-Chaouch,Caroline Cieniewski-Bernard,Samir Bensaid,Claudine Fabre,Mehdi Pawlak-Chaouch,Caroline Cieniewski-Bernard","In skeletal muscle, chronic oxygen depletion induces a disturbance leading to muscle atrophy. Mechanical stress (physical exercise) and nutritional supplement therapy are commonly used against loss of muscle mass and undernutrition in hypoxia, while oxygenation therapy is preferentially used to counteract muscle fatigue and exercise intolerance. However, the impact of oxygenation on skeletal muscle cells remains poorly understood, in particular on signalling pathways regulating protein balance. Thus, we investigated the effects of each separated treatment (mechanical stress, nutritional supplementation and oxygenation therapy) on intracellular pathways involved in protein synthesis and degradation that are imbalanced in skeletal muscle cells atrophy resulting from hypoxia. Myotubes under hypoxia were treated by electrical stimulation, amino acids supplement or oxygenation period. Signalling pathways involved in protein synthesis (PI3K-Akt-mTOR) and degradation (FoxO1 and FoxO3a) were investigated, so as autophagy, ubiquitin-proteasome system and myotube morphology. Electrical stimulation and oxygenation treatment resulted in higher myotube diameter, myogenic fusion index and myotubes density until 48 h post-treatment compared to untreated hypoxic myotubes. Both treatments also induced inhibition of FoxO3a and decreased activity of ubiquitin-proteasome system; however, their impact on protein synthesis pathway was specific for each one. Indeed, electrical stimulation impacted upstream proteins to mTOR (i.e., Akt) while oxygenation treatment activated downstream targets of mTOR (i.e., 4E-BP1 and P70S6K). In contrast, amino acid supplementation had very few effects on myotube morphology nor on protein homeostasis. This study demonstrated that electrical stimulation or oxygenation period are two effective treatments to fight against hypoxia-induced muscle atrophy, acting through different molecular adaptations."

A survey design was used in the study. A representative sample of 30 lecturers was randomly selected from 5 Faculty of Natural Resources Management and Agriculture departments to complete the questionnaire between June and July 2020. The majority of the lecturers agreed that they were involved in the curriculum development. There was affirmation on the issue of professional development, leadership's support for lecturers' curriculum implementation and adequate time for curriculum implementation. Similarly, there was collaboration between university leadership and lecturers to plan curriculum implementation. On the contrary, funds for research necessary for curriculum implementation, instructional materials and supplies and technological resources were not adequately supplied. Hence, the paper becomes critical as it highlights the unavailability of technological resources which play a crucial role in online teaching and learning during the COVID-19 pandemic."
1507,Lunar Crater Identification in Digital Images,"John A Christian,Harm Derksen,Ryan Watkins,John A Christian,Harm Derksen,Ryan Watkins","It is often necessary to identify a pattern of observed craters in a single image of the lunar surface and without any prior knowledge of the camera's location. This so-called ""lost-in-space"" crater identification problem is common in both crater-based terrain relative navigation (TRN) and in automatic registration of scientific imagery. Past work on crater identification has largely been based on heuristic schemes, with poor performance outside of a narrowly defined operating regime (e.g., nadir pointing images, small search areas). This work provides the first mathematically rigorous treatment of the general crater identification problem. It is shown when it is (and when it is not) possible to recognize a pattern of elliptical crater rims in an image formed by perspective projection. For the cases when it is possible to recognize a pattern, descriptors are developed using invariant theory that provably capture all of the viewpoint invariant information. These descriptors may be pre-computed for known crater patterns and placed in a searchable index for fast recognition. New techniques are also developed for computing pose from crater rim observations and for evaluating crater rim correspondences. These techniques are demonstrated on both synthetic and real images."
1508,Frequency change of future extreme summer meteorological and hydrological droughts over North America,"Zhao, Cha; Brissette, Francois; Chen, Jie; Martel, Jean-Luc","This paper describes projected frequency changes in extreme summer meteorological and hydrological droughts over North American catchments. It uses two large ensemble climate models (50-member CanESM2 and 40-member CESM1) under the RCP 8.5 scenario to robustly assess frequency changes up to the 100-year drought, relative to the 1980-2009 reference period. Meteorological droughts, linked solely to precipitation deficit, are represented by the 1-month Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI), whereas hydrological droughts are characterized by the 1-month Streamflow Drought Index (SDI), based on hydrological simulation using a lumped hydrological model. Results show widely different patterns for future changes in extreme meteorological versus hydrological droughts. Future meteorological droughts show patterns of increasing and decreasing frequency that roughly match future expected changes of mean summer precipitation, although some regions are nonetheless projected to see more frequent extreme meteorological droughts despite increases in mean summer precipitation. The frequency changes for the 100-year meteorological droughts can be quite severe, with up to a 20-fold increase observed over some watersheds. On the other hand, hydrological droughts, which combine the effect of precipitation and temperature changes, show a mostly uniform pattern of large to very large increases in drought frequency. This shows that the projected temperature increase is a main driver of future extreme hydrological droughts, enough to overcome the projected increase in mean summer precipitation for many North American catchments. Projected changes in both meteorological and hydrological droughts get consistently worse for the longer considered return periods. In other words, frequency changes for the 100-year droughts are more significant than those expected for the 2- and 20-year droughts. This gradual worsening toward larger extremes has potentially large societal and economic impacts. The large projected increases in the frequency of extreme hydrological drought frequency (up to 27 times) are likely to severely stress water management systems across North America."

Aiming to provide guidance on the most sustainable food waste utilisation routes, this study evaluates the life cycle environmental and economic sustainability of five plausible scenarios for the year 2030. Focusing on the UK for context, these are compared to the current treatment of food waste as well as to its potential future prevention. The scenarios consider a differing share of four widely-used treatment methods: anaerobic digestion, in-vessel composting, incineration and landfilling. The scenario with the highest anaerobic digestion share that recovers both heat and electricity is the best option for seven out of 19 environmental impacts and the second best for life cycle costs. Upgrading anaerobic digestion biogas to biomethane achieves the lowest global warming potential and life cyde costs. Net-negative global warming potential (savings) can be achieved if the heat from anaerobic digestion and incineration or biomethane are utilised to displace natural gas. Displacing a future electricity mix does not lead to significant global warming potential savings due to the expected grid decarbonisation. However, savings are still achieved for metal depletion and human and terrestrial toxicities as they are higher for decarbonised grid electricity due to the increased share of renewables. A greater share of in-vessel composting leads to higher impacts because of the high electricity consumption. Landfill reduction has an economic advantage for all the scenarios, except for the business-as-usual, with life cycle costs 11-75% lower than for the current situation. While future scenarios improve the overall sustainability compared to the current situation, halving food waste by 2030 can save 15 times more greenhouse gas emissions than the best treatment scenario without waste reduction. Therefore, any commitments to improve the sustainability of food waste treatment must be accompanied by an effective waste prevention strategy. The outcomes of this work can help waste treatment operators and policy makers towards more sustainable food waste management. Although the focus is on UK situation, the overall conclusions and recommendations are applicable to other regions. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."
1510,Outcomes following surgical treatment of distal radial fracture: a comparison of older and younger patients using PROMIS,"Alex M Hollenberg,Jennifer Z Mao,Warren C Hammert,Alex M Hollenberg,Jennifer Z Mao,Warren C Hammert","The purpose of this study was to assess the recovery patterns following surgery for distal radial fracture (DRF) in patients over (n = 99) and under (n = 273) the age of 65 using the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Physical Function (PF) and Pain Interference (PI) questionnaires. Both the older and younger cohorts showed postoperative improvement in PF and PI. The younger cohort had higher PF scores from 1 to 6 months postoperatively, however, PI scores were not significantly different between the cohorts during any period. A greater proportion of younger patients achieved the minimal clinically important difference improvement on the PROMIS PF (80% versus 66%) and PI (88% versus 75%) scales. To appropriately manage postoperative expectations, older patients should be counselled that they would likely experience most of their functional recovery by 3 months and limitations due to pain would likely be stable by 1 month.Level of evidence: II."
1511,A change is gonna come: will traditional meat production end?,"Halil Simdi,Ayberk Seker,Halil Simdi,Ayberk Seker","Recently, the world has faced environmental disasters mainly due to global warming. One of the main reasons for global temperature imbalances is the greenhouse gases (GHG) that soar the atmosphere's heat. The major aim of the current study is to explore whether the livestock population is the main contributor to GHG emission through econometric estimations. In this study, we examine the impact of livestock population with other explanatory variables-GDP per capita, Economic Complexity Index (ECI), ecological balance, and total patent applications-over GHG emission of 25 countries responsible for 76% of GHG emission between 1990 and 2017. To investigate the relationship of variables, Fully modified ordinary least squares (FMOLS) and dynamic ordinary least squares (DOLS) are used, as well as panel causality. Also, the relationship is examined by using the responsiveness scores (RS) approach. The empirical results reveal that all variables have a causal relationship with GHG emission. GDP per capita, ECI, and livestock population enhance the GHG emission whereas square of GDP per capita and ecological balance decline the environmental degradation. The paper demonstrates that the environmental Kuznets curve is valid and supports the literature. Lastly, the RS estimation results reveal that the livestock population is causing higher GHG emissions for all countries in the analysis, contrary to other independent variables. Governments should promote carbon-neutral meat production facilities instead of traditional beef farms to live in a more sustainable world. In the future, countries that invest in research and development (R&D) for less emission meat production will have a comparative advantage in the sustainable international meat market."
1512,A biochemiluminescent assay for rapid diagnosis of influenza,"Xuexiang Lin,Jia Gu,Xuexiang Lin,Jia Gu","A biochemiluminescent assay of influenza diagnosis is presented. The assay diagnoses influenza based on detection of the influenza viral neuraminidase activity. An instrument designed for the assay is also reported. This assay solves the problem that current influenza virus diagnosis assays are susceptible to virus mutation. A luciferase-based complex is synthesized as biochemiluminescent substrate. The substrate is cleaved to free luciferin with presence of influenza neuraminidase in specimen. Luciferase is oxidized to oxyluciferin with luciferin as catalyzer resulting in luminescence, which is proportional to the neuraminidase activity and measured by instrument. The instrument uses a photomultiplier tube as sensor, with 24 test channels. Fine optical arrangements enable the instrument with high sensitivity and accuracy. A total of 389 clinical specimens were collected to evaluate the performance of the assay in clinical settings. This assay had a sensitivity and specificity of 95.92% (95% confidence interval 91.38-98.12%) and 97.93% (95% confidence interval 95.26-99.11%), respectively, compared to the colloidal gold assay. As a biochemiluminscence assay, this assay is advantageous in sensitivity and specificity. It does not require any washing or separation steps, which makes the instrument simple in design and easy to operate or maintenance. The assay is suitable for the rapid diagnosis of influenza virus in point-of-care settings."
1513,Identification of ecosystem service bundles and driving factors in Beijing and its surrounding areas,"Chen, Tianqian; Feng, Zhe; Zhao, Huafu; Wu, Kening","In high-intensity human activity areas, such as metropolises, rapid changes in land use, agricultural intensification, and population urbanization have resulted in profound and complex transformations in socio-economic ecosystems. The study of ecosystem service (ES) bundle is conducive to various aspects, such as determination of the variation characteristics of ES; identification of the mechanism of interdependence within ES; and driving mechanism of socio-economic-ecological factors to ES to maintain the sustainable development of the region. The research areas include Beijing and its surrounding areas. Ten ES, including grain providing (GP), water yield (WY), carbon sequestration (CS), soil retention (SEC), purified water service, cultural services, and habitat quality (HQ) were selected for valuing and mapping. The ES paired trade-offs and synergetic relationship, bundle was determined, and the bundles' service types and spatial distribution characteristics were analyzed. Subsequently, GeoDetector was used for detecting the factors affecting the bundles' distribution. Results showed that WY, CS, SEC, and HQ were bounded by Tai -hang and Yanshan Mountains. Among the 45 pairs of ES, 38 pairs bore significant correlation. Multiple services had different degrees of positive and negative correlations with other services. For example, GP had a high positive correlation with WY while bearing a high negative correlation with HQ. Seven bundles include SEC, culture, urban, HQ agriculture, water supply and purification, and water purification. Various factors played decisive roles in the bundles' spatial distribution. Among them, the investment capacity and demand for ecological protection depend on the level of GDP and POP. The formulation of agricultural planting plans is inseparable from TADEM. ASL is directly related to species richness. Results indicate that bundle research can identify the areas of the formation of co-occurrence of trade-offs and synergies and support the formulation of ES optimal management plans for different regions through further research of the driving mechanism.

Intranasal administration of M2-SF for 7 days led to stimulation of locomotor and exploratory activities and a decrease in emotional reactivity in the open-field test as well as reduction in depression-like behavior in Porsolt forced swimming test and a decrease in anxiety and anhedonia. Correction of depression-like behavior was accompanied by down-regulation of proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6, TNFα, and IFNγ) in pathogenetically important brain structures (striatum, hippocampus, and frontal cortex). These data indicate that the antidepressant potential of M2 type macrophages can be mediated by the anti-inflammatory effects of M2-SF."

There is sparse data comparing MBI-LCBI management practices, in particular central venous catheter (CVC) salvage versus removal. We created a 22-item poll of Infectious Disease specialists at major US cancer centers on management controversies. Response rate was 44% (31/70). CVC salvage was a common practice among 87.5%. This was followed by a single center retrospective study (2017-2019) comparing outcomes related to CVC practices. We identified 115 patients, 52% (60/115) admitted for chemotherapy and 33% (38/115) for allogeneic HCT. The majority of patients (78%, 90/115) had their CVC removed. There was no difference in 72 h defervescence, microbiological clearance, in-hospital mortality, and 90-day recurrent infection between CVC salvage versus removal. CVC salvage is a safe approach in certain clinical scenarios."
1516,Topological Features of Electroencephalography are Robust to Re-referencing and Preprocessing,"Jacob Billings,Ruxandra Tivadar,Micah M Murray,Benedetta Franceschiello,Giovanni Petri,Jacob Billings,Ruxandra Tivadar,Micah M Murray,Benedetta Franceschiello,Giovanni Petri","Electroencephalography (EEG) is among the most widely diffused, inexpensive, and adopted neuroimaging techniques. Nonetheless, EEG requires measurements against a reference site(s), which is typically chosen by the experimenter, and specific pre-processing steps precede analyses. It is therefore valuable to obtain quantities that are minimally affected by reference and pre-processing choices. Here, we show that the topological structure of embedding spaces, constructed either from multi-channel EEG timeseries or from their temporal structure, are subject-specific and robust to re-referencing and pre-processing pipelines. By contrast, the shape of correlation spaces, that is, discrete spaces where each point represents an electrode and the distance between them that is in turn related to the correlation between the respective timeseries, was neither significantly subject-specific nor robust to changes of reference. Our results suggest that the shape of spaces describing the observed configurations of EEG signals holds information about the individual specificity of the underlying individual's brain dynamics, and that temporal correlations constrain to a large degree the set of possible dynamics. In turn, these encode the differences between subjects' space of resting state EEG signals. Finally, our results and proposed methodology provide tools to explore the individual topographical landscapes and how they are explored dynamically. We propose therefore to augment conventional topographic analyses with an additional-topological-level of analysis, and to consider them jointly. More generally, these results provide a roadmap for the incorporation of topological analyses within EEG pipelines."

As a group of conservation biologists deeply concerned about the decline of insect populations, we here review what we know about the drivers of insect extinctions, their consequences, and how extinctions can negatively impact humanity. We are causing insect extinctions by driving habitat loss, degradation, and fragmentation, use of polluting and harmful substances, the spread of invasive species, global climate change, direct overexploitation, and co-extinction of species dependent on other species. With insect extinctions, we lose much more than species. We lose abundance and biomass of insects, diversity across space and time with consequent homogenization, large parts of the tree of life, unique ecological functions and traits, and fundamental parts of extensive networks of biotic interactions. Such losses lead to the decline of key ecosystem services on which humanity depends. From pollination and decomposition, to being resources for new medicines, habitat quality indication and many others, insects provide essential and irreplaceable services. We appeal for urgent action to close key knowledge gaps and curb insect extinctions. An investment in research programs that generate local, regional and global strategies that counter this trend is essential. Solutions are available and implementable, but urgent action is needed now to match our intentions."

Thirty-four girls having CPP, 24 girls having PT, and 49 healthy growing girls between 7 and 9 years of age admitted to child health supervision were enrolled. Total antioxidant and oxidant capacity, myeloperoxidase, catalase, superoxide dismutase, total thiol, native thiol, and disulfide levels were analyzed in serum samples. Low total oxidant status (<12.0) was found to be highest in the CPP group, lowest in the control group, and the PT group was in between them. After controlling bone age and z score for body mass index, generalized linear models revealed lower oxidative stress index values in the CPP and the PT groups than the control group. Other studied parameters did not differ among groups. Precocious puberty in girls is associated with some changes in the oxidant-antioxidant status."
1520,Experimental investigation and economic assessment of a solar still performance using high-frequency ultrasound waves atomizer,"El-Said, Emad M. S.; Abdelaziz, Gamal B.","In this paper, an experimental study is performed to investigate the influence of utilizing high frequency ultrasound atomizer (HFU) on augmenting the performance of a solar still (SS). Atomized saline water has been utilized as a motivator to enhance the humidification process inside the SS cavity. Due to the negative influence of fogging on heat transfer by radiation, an on-off timer is utilized to control the HFU atomizer on-time and off-time which helps to avoid this influence. The different parameters such as the atomizer number, water height, feed water salinity and on-time and off-time were studied with two operating modes; HFU-SS (SS with atomizers) and C-SS (conventional design). It has been found that the saline water atomizing by ultrasound waves significantly augments the evaporation performance inside the SS cavity. Results depict that the increasing of the atomizer number has a positive influence on the system efficiency and productivity. Results show that the C-SS and HFU-SS daily productivity were about 3.58 L/m(2) and 4.41 L/m(2) respectively. The average thermal efficiency of the HFU-SS atomizer was augmented by about 28.75%-55.75% compared to C-SS. The thermal efficiency of HFU-SS affect the atomizer number and reaches the maximum value 40.21% at two atomizer. The thermal efficiency of HFU-SS decreased with the increment of the water height and varied between 35.61% and 40.5%. The thermal efficiency of HFU-SS was augmented by about 72% for on-time = 25 min and off-time = 25 min compared to the continuous operation. Also, an economic analysis was performed and illustrated that the cost of distillate water from HFU-SS reduced by about 12.94%-14.54% less than C-SS. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."
1521,Industrial construction safety policies and practices with cost impacts in a COVID-19 pandemic environment: A Louisiana DOW case study,"Brian Briggs,Carol J Friedland,Isabelina Nahmens,Charles Berryman,Yimin Zhu,Brian Briggs,Carol J Friedland,Isabelina Nahmens,Charles Berryman,Yimin Zhu","There are always significant challenges in improving the safety culture by changing and adding additional safety protocols. The unknown impacts of COVID-19 and how it quickly spreads led the industry to institute essential safety protocols. This paper addresses two problem statements. The first problem statement is: what are the additional safety protocols for process safety, construction & maintenance, and personal protective equipment requirements? The second problem statement is: what are the cost and schedule impacts of industrial construction projects resulting from implementing safety protocols and process safety during construction with the added PPE? While complying with added safety protocols, the industrial construction industry cannot forget that it has a distinct reputation for high incident rates and less than desirable safety performance. In 2017, the construction industry suffered 971 fatalities. This alarming number is compared to 1123 total fatalities in 2017 for the Gulf Coast States. The objective is to share the rationale and practices of social distancing, required additional PPE, and personal hygiene practices to reduce spreading and outbreaks during a pandemic within an industrial construction environment. Before any construction work, the process safety teams must clear, isolate, and tag out process lines, equipment, and instruments to be repaired or replaced. The information presented demonstrates the significant cost and schedule impacts that industrial construction companies will encounter during a pandemic like COVID-19. This paper aims to improve safety processes, cost & schedule impacts, and prescribe additional personal protective equipment in industrial construction during a pandemic such as COVID-19. The COVID-19 pandemic spread globally in a very short period. The reactions in mitigating the spread were suggestive, with little to no data on safety protective equipment and practices. The contribution this paper addresses are how to employ efficient safety practices and policies during a pandemic in an industrial construction environment."
1522,Identifying the Contributions of Multi-Source Data for Winter Wheat Yield Prediction in China,"Cao, Juan; Zhang, Zhao; Tao, Fulu; Zhang, Liangliang; Luo, Yuchuan; Han, Jichong; Li, Ziyue","Wheat is a leading cereal grain throughout the world. Timely and reliable wheat yield prediction at a large scale is essential for the agricultural supply chain and global food security, especially in China as an important wheat producing and consuming country. The conventional approach using either climate or satellite data or both to build empirical and crop models has prevailed for decades. However, to what extent climate and satellite data can improve yield prediction is still unknown. In addition, socio-economic (SC) factors may also improve crop yield prediction, but their contributions need in-depth investigation, especially in regions with good irrigation conditions, sufficient fertilization, and pesticide application. Here, we performed the first attempt to predict wheat yield across China from 2001 to 2015 at the county-level by integrating multi-source data, including monthly climate data, satellite data (i.e., Vegetation indices (VIs)), and SC factors. The results show that incorporating all the datasets by using three machine learning methods (Ridge Regression (RR), Random Forest (RF), and Light Gradient Boosting (LightGBM)) can achieve the best performance in yield prediction (R-2: 0.68 similar to 0.75), with the most individual contributions from climate (similar to 0.53), followed by VIs (similar to 0.45), and SC factors (similar to 0.30). In addition, the combinations of VIs and climate data can capture inter-annual yield variability more effectively than other combinations (e.g., combinations of climate and SC, and combinations of VIs and SC), while combining SC with climate data can better capture spatial yield variability than others. Climate data can provide extra and unique information across the entire growing season, while the peak stage of VIs (Mar.similar to Apr.) do so. Furthermore, incorporating spatial information and soil proprieties into the benchmark models can improve wheat yield prediction by 0.06 and 0.12, respectively. The optimal wheat prediction can be achieved with approximately a two-month leading time before maturity. Our study develops timely and robust methods for winter wheat yield prediction at a large scale in China, which can be applied to other crops and regions."
1523,Assessment of 3D printing using fused deposition modeling and selective laser sintering for a circular economy,"DePalma, K.; Walluk, M. R.; Murtaugh, A.; Hilton, J.; McConky, S.; Hilton, B.","Plastic today is commonplace. Products and parts made with plastic have short life cycles, ending up in landfills not long after manufacture. Finding new pathways for plastic waste has become a critical focus of sustainability efforts, especially within manufacturing. Thus, research in this field continues to grow in order to determine the feasibility of reclaiming post-consumer plastic for reuse. This paper evaluates the potential for a sustainable, circular pathway for end-of-life plastic material using 3D-printing techniques. To do this, the work investigates two prevalent industrial 3D-printing technologies: selective laser sintering (SLS) and fused deposition modeling (FDM) of polymers. Material-flow and economic models are developed to outline how plastic parts at the end of their life cycle can be processed and reused. Prior works on fundamental material degradation are integrated into mathematical models of cost and operation. This enables mapping of how multiple reuse cycles affect two prevalent industrial polymers: acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) and polyamide 12 (PA 12). The mapping identifies there is significant opportunity for improving both SLS and FDM 3D-printing technologies when it comes to economic viability and sustainability. Comparison between reuse of FDM using ABS and SLS using PA 12 shows the former costs 82% less than the latter, while also producing 87% less waste than it. While the study established that available industrial 3D-printing technologies can help to reduce plastic waste within manufacturing, a fully circular economy demands materials with less thermal degradation than the primary industrial 3D-printing polymers.

Literature on the indications for nonoperative treatment of thoracolumbar fractures is conflicting. The purpose of this systematic review is to clarify the indications for nonsurgical treatment of thoracolumbar fractures. We conducted a systematic literature search between 2010 to 2020 on PubMed/MEDLINE, and Cochrane Central. Up-to-date literature on the indications for nonoperative treatment of thoracolumbar fractures was reviewed to reach an agreement in a consensus meeting of WFNS (World Federation of Neurosurgical Societies) Spine Committee. The statements were voted and reached a positive or negative consensus using the Delphi method. For all of the questions discussed, the literature search yielded 1,264 studies, from which 54 articles were selected for full-text review. Nine studies (4 trials, and 5 retrospective) evaluating 759 participants with thoracolumbar fractures who underwent nonoperative/surgery were included. Although, compression type and stable burst fractures can be managed conservatively, if there is major vertebral body damage, kyphotic angulation, neurological deficit, spinal canal compromise, surgery may be indicated. AO type B, C fractures are preferably treated surgically. Future research is necessary to tackle the relative paucity of evidence pertaining to patients with thoracolumbar fractures."

It is one of the potential contributors to air and water pollution and possesses long-term impact on their quality. Keeping in view the exponential mining activities, we have selected an iron mine area in Bailadila, Chhattisgarh, India, as a sampling site and investigated the impact of mining activities on the air as well as water quality by setting up seven air quality and thirty water quality monitoring stations. From the results obtained, it was observed that concentration of air pollutants such as SO2, NO2, PM2.5 and PM10 for the year 2015 lies in the range of 11.5-13.0 µg/m3, 11.5-13.0 µg/m3, 24.9-33.4 ppm and 61.6-74.2 ppm, respectively, while for the year 2018, it lies in the range of 10.3-11.7 µg/m3, 10.5-14.7 µg/m3, 18.3-50.8 ppm and 23.7-60.7 ppm, respectively. Furthermore, results obtained revealed that air pollutants such as SO2, NO2, PM2.5 and PM10 were within the permissible limits but they contributed towards the light air pollution (air pollution index: 25-50) at all the air monitoring stations. Moreover, PM10 was considered as criterion pollutant in the Bailadila, Chhattisgarh region. On the other hand, it was observed that groundwater quality was deteriorated in the subsequent years. Most of the water quality parameters were in the permissible limits except iron (Fe). Moreover, on the basis of water quality indexing, water quality was classified as ""poor"" in ~ 30% of the sites and ""very poor"" in ~ 34% sites. The water quality was ""unhealthy for drinking"" in 3% and 6% sites in the year 2015 and 2018, respectively."

Studies on bioremediation via composting began during the 1990s and have exponentially increased over the years. A total of 655 articles have been published since then, with 40% published in the last six years. The robustness, low cost, and easy operation of composting technology make it an attractive bioremediation strategy for organic contaminants prevalent in soils and sediment. Successful pilot-and large-scale bioremediation of organic contaminants, e.g., total petroleum hydrocarbons, plasticizers, and persistent organic pollutants (POPs) by composting, has been documented in the literature. For example, composting could remediate >90% diesel with concentrations as high as 26,315 mg kg-a of initial composting material after 24 days. Composting has unique advantages over traditional single- and multi-strain bioaugmentation approaches, including a diverse microbial community, ease of operation, and the ability to handle higher concentrations. Bioremediation via composting depends on the diverse microbial community; thus, key parameters, including nutrients (C/N ratio = 25-30), moisture (55-65%), and oxygen content (O2 > 10%) should be optimized for successful bioremediation. This review will provide bioremediation and composting researchers with the most recent finding in the field and stimulate new research ideas."
1527,Eco-innovation and energy productivity: New determinants of renewable energy consumption,"Li, Jingwen; Zhang, Xueyuan; Ali, Shahid; Khan, Zeeshan","This study provides new empirical evidence on the determinants of renewable energy consumption in the case of OECD economies over the period from 1990 to 2017. To examine the long run relationship among variables of renewable energy consumption and its determinants, this study uses the Durbin Hausman group mean cointegration test. The long-run and short-run coefficients are estimated via the cross-sectional Autoregressive Distributive Lag (CS-ARDL) method. The significant cointegration vector confirms the long-run equilibrium among the variables presented in the model. The results show that income, human capital, energy productivity, energy prices, and eco-innovation are important factors in explaining renewable energy consumption. This study adopts the Augmented Mean Group (AMG) method to check the robustness of the model. The results are found to be consistent with the estimates of the cross-sectional Autoregressive Distributive Lag Model method. To offer viable solutions to environmental problems and to achieve the targets set in the Paris Climate Agreement, policies and strategies should be devised to increase the share of renewable energy in the overall energy mix."

As the largest family of transcription factors in the human genome, zinc finger (ZNF) proteins are characterized by their different DNA binding motifs, such as C2H2 and Gag knuckle. Different kinds of zinc finger motifs exhibit a wide variety of biological functions. Zinc finger proteins have been reported in various diseases, especially in several cancers. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the third leading cause of cancer-associated death worldwide, especially in China. Most of HCC patients have suffered from hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) injection for a long time. Although the surgical operation of HCC has been extremely developed, the prognosis of HCC is still very poor, and the underlying mechanisms in HCC tumorigenesis are still not completely understood.

However, only a few studies have concerned the effect of chemical dispersant on this process. In this paper, the mechanism by which dispersant affects the surface properties of kaolin and the viscosity and oil-seawater interfacial tension (IFTow) of Roncador crude oil were separately investigated by small-scale tests. The results indicated that the presence of dispersant impairs the zeta potential and enhances the hydrophobicity of kaolin. The viscosity of Roncador crude oil rose slightly as the dosage of dispersant increased, while IFTow decreased significantly. Furthermore, the oil dispersion and OMA formation at different dispersant-to-oil ratio (DOR) were evaluated in a wave tank. When DOR was less than 1:40, the effect of dispersant on the dispersion of spilled oil was not obvious. With the increasing DOR, the effect became more pronounced, and the adhesion between oil droplets and kaolin was inhibited. The size ratio between oil droplets and particles is the significant factor for OMA formation. The closer the oil-mineral size ratio is to 1, the more difficultly the OMA forms."
1530,Analyzing influencing factors of green transformation in China's manufacturing industry under environmental regulation: A structural equation model,"Zhai, Xueqi; An, Yunfei","The promotion of the green transformation of the manufacturing industry has become the main means to achieve the dual goals of environmental protection and economic growth. Environmental regulation, as an environment governance tool, exerts an important impact on the green transformation of the manufacturing industry. Therefore, this paper focused on the influencing factors of green transformation of the manufacturing industry under environmental regulation. Based on survey data of 500 Chinese manufacturing enterprises (2017), the influencing factors of green transformation were studied by developing a targeted structural equation model. The main conclusions showed that (1) human capital, financing ability, technology innovation, and government behavior all exerted significant positive impact on green transformation performance in the manufacturing industry. (2) Environmental regulation, as a moderating variable, positively affected the green transformation in the manufacturing industry by acting on technology innovation and governmental behavior; however, it decreased the positive impact of financing ability on green transformation. (3) Environmental regulation was a reversal mechanism, which affected green transformation by influencing financing capacity, technology innovation, and governmental behavior of manufacturing enterprises. The study suggested that the government should consider the positive impact of these influencing factors, and design appropriate environmental regulation policies to promote the green transformation in the manufacturing industry to achieve economic green growth.

Descriptive analysis revealed that the majority of the participants agreed with the items (mean scale score was 160.99 ± 15.99). The Item and Scales content validity indices were 0.85-1.00 and 0.93 respectively. In the construct validity analysis, the scale was divided into five sub-dimensions at an acceptable level. The reliability coefficient was calculated as 0.87. In the analysis of scale items variance component percentages estimated for person, for items, and for person × item were 14.1%, 29%, and 56.9%, respectively. In conclusion, IPAS-TR is a valid and reliable tool that can be used to measure interprofessional attitudes."
1532,Advances in the agrochemical utilization of fermentation residues reduce the cost of purpose-grown phytomass for biogas production,"Marousek, Josef; Bartos, Petr; Filip, Martin; Kolar, Ladislav; Konvalina, Petr; Marouskova, Anna; Moudry, Jan; Peterka, Jiri; Sal, Jiri; Soch, Miloslav; Stehel, Vojtech; Strunecky, Otakar; Suchy, Karel; Vochozka, Marek; Vrbka, Jaromir; Zoubek, Tornas","The share of renewables is rising rapidly, especially in developed countries. Biogas production from purpose-grown phytomass is undergoing the fastest growth. The trend is linked to the production of vast amounts of fermentation residues. However, it has been repeatedly and independently reported that intensive or long-term application of fermentation residues into arable land changes soil structure, resulting in sharp degradation of its fertility. This is now compensated by more intense use of agrochemicals and additional agrotechnical operations such as biochar addition. However, the increased cost is beginning to threaten the economic sustainability of biogas production. Given the fact that the production of biogas from purpose-grown phytomass has become a strong pillar of the electricity grid, the threat to soil fertility may endanger its stability. The quality and quantity of soil organic matter (SOM) and in particular its stable organic fractions with ion-exchange properties (SOF) that determine soil fertility, or, more precisely, the transport of nutrients and their availability for plant growth, were investigated in detail. A novel, undemanding and quick method allowing the analysis and interpretation of SOM and its SOF was proposed and compared with conventional methods. It was confirmed that the adaptation of the new method enables farmers to better choose organic and mineral fertilizers and corresponding agronomic operations, so the soil can provide higher yields and an increased water retention capacity (up to 7%), which results in improved water retention during extreme rainfalls or droughts, altogether lowering the cost of purpose-grown phytomass, or, more precisely, improving the economy of biogas production."
1533,Omsk hemorrhagic fever virus is a tick-borne encephalitis virus adapted to muskrat through host-jumping,"Sergey Y Kovalev,Elena A Mazurina,Sergey Y Kovalev,Elena A Mazurina","Omsk hemorrhagic fever was first described in the early 1940s and is a natural focal infection, spread exclusively in four regions of Western Siberia, and associated with muskrat (Ondatra zibethicus). The etiological agent of this disease is the Omsk hemorrhagic fever virus (OHFV) which is closely related to the tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV), and its range entirely lies within the TBEV area. OHFV belongs to the mammalian tick-borne flaviviruses and the ecological group of arboviruses. The problem concerning the origin of OHFV remains unresolved to date. This study analyzed all nucleotide sequences of the OHFV genome obtained in the present study and available in GenBank, including the E gene fragment and the amino acid sequences of the surface glycoprotein encoded by it. The conclusions, based on the clusteron approach, suggest that OHFV originated directly from the TBEV of the Far Eastern subtype due to the host-jump phenomenon, that is, through a rapid change from an arthropod host, Ixodes persulcatus, to a rodent, O. zibethicus. The muskrat was introduced to Western Siberia in the second half of the 1930s. The peculiarities of the biology and ecology of the muskrat in the new habitat became the reason for the TBEV cross-species transmission. Calculations show that host-jumping occurred between 1931 and 1947 and accompanied a cascade of adaptive amino acid substitutions in protein E. As a result, the virus changed its transmission to contact, alimentary, and airborne routes. Based on the data obtained, OHFV would be more correctly attributed to zoonotic viruses transmitted by rodents and, accordingly, to the ecological group of roboviruses."

Understanding these is key to optimizing outcomes for patients with Hodgkin lymphoma (HL). We evaluated the immunophenotypic characteristics of cytotoxic, helper T and NK lymphocytes upon in vitro stimulation, cell-mediated cytotoxicity against HL cells, HDLM-2 and KM-H2, and the association with effector cell activation state, as well as changes in cytotoxicity following PD-1 or PDL-1 blockade. Higher HLA-DR/CD38 expression on effector cells was associated with increased cytotoxicity against HL cells. All effector cell types were cytotoxic of HL cells, though achieved maximum activation and cytotoxicity at variable timepoints. HLA-DR/CD38 co-expression correlated with cytotoxicity, but PD-1 expression did not. There was no significant change in cell-mediated cytotoxicity following PD-1/PDL-1 blockade. The mechanism of action of checkpoint inhibitors may not be limited to direct PD-1/PDL-1 blockade."
1535,Compact city planning and development: Emerging practices and strategies for achieving the goals of sustainability,"Bibri, Simon Elias; Krogstie, John; Karrholm, Mattias","The compact city is one of the leading paradigms of sustainable urbanism. Compact city planning and development has, over the last 30 years or so, been the preferred response to the challenges of sustainable development. It is strongly promoted by global and local policies due to its positive outcomes in terms of contributing to the economic, environmental, and social goals of sustainability. This paper examines how the compact city model is practiced and justified in urban planning and development with respect to the three dimensions of sustainability, and whether any progress has been made in this regard. To illuminate this urban phenomenon accordingly, a descriptive case study is adopted as a qualitative research methodology where the empirical basis is mainly formed by the official plans and documents of two Swedish cities: Gothenburg and Helsingborg, in combination with qualitative interview data and secondary data. This study shows that compactness, density, diversity, mixed land use, sustainable transportation, and green space are the core design strategies of compact city planning and development, with the latter being contextually linked to the concept of green structure, an institutional setup under which the two cities operate. Moreover, at the core of the compact city model is the clear synergy between the underlying strategies in terms of their cooperation to produce combined effects greater than the sum of their separate effects with respect to the benefits of sustainability as to its tripartite composition. Further, this study demonstrates that the compact city model as practiced by the two cities is justified by its ability to contribute to the economic, environmental, and social goals of sustainability. However, the economic goals dominate over the environmental and social goals, notwithstanding the claim about the three dimensions of sustainability being equally important at the discursive level. Nevertheless, new measures are being developed and implemented to strengthen their influence over urban planning and development practices towards balancing the three goals of sustainability."
1536,Decoupling and mitigation potential analysis of CO2 emissions from Pakistan's transport sector,"Raza, Muhammad Yousaf; Lin, Boqiang","The transport sector has become one of the major economic, huge fossil fuel energy consumption, and carbon dioxide (CO2) emitting sector of Pakistan. This study applies the logarithmic mean Divisia index (LMDI) and Tapio's decoupling approach to estimate decoupling state and mitigation potential of CO2 emissions from the transport sector during 1984-2018. LMDI technique is applied to detect the influencing variables (i.e. carbon coefficient, fuel consumption, total energy consumption, and turn over economy), which oversee CO2 emissions. The outcomes show that CO2 coefficient effect is the factor which is decreasing CO2 emissions while economic growth (EG) effect is the factor which is growing CO2 emissions. The decoupling index is also applied to influencing factors which reflect the EG factors on CO2 emissions from the transport sector. The consequences confirm that during 1984-2018, the CO2 emissions show an expensive coupling with EG. Weak decoupling occurred only in the sub-periods 1999-2003, 2004-2008, and 2009-2013. Similarly, the CO2 emissions occurred from only three decoupling grades. Furthermore, a mitigation model based on the above impacting variables estimates the mitigation rate of CO2 emissions and showed that the CO2 mitigation seemed in 1999-2003, 2004-2008, and 2009-2013. Finally, forecasting outcomes of Tapio decoupling index show a weak decoupling during 2018-2030. Therefore, based on the empirical outcomes, this study puts forward a few policy suggestions to efficiently enhance the decoupling between Pakistan's transport CO2 emissions and EG.

1537,Recent advances in membrane technologies for hydrogen purification,"Bernardo, Gabriel; Araujo, Tiago; Lopes, Telmo da Silva; Sousa, Jose; Mendes, Adelio","Planet Earth is facing accelerated global warming due to greenhouse gas emissions from human activities. The United Nations agreement at the Paris Climate Conference in 2015 highlighted the importance of reducing CO2 emissions from fossil fuel combustion. Hydrogen is a clean and efficient energy carrier and a hydrogen-based economy is now widely regarded as a potential solution for the future of energy security and sustainability. Although hydrogen can be produced from water electrolysis, economic reasons dictate that most of the H-2 produced worldwide, currently comes from the steam reforming of natural gas and this situation is set to continue in the foreseeable future. This production process delivers a H-2-rich mixture of gases from which H-2 needs to be purified up to the ultra-high purity levels required by fuel cells (99.97%). This driving force pushes for the development of newer H-2 purification technologies that can be highly selective and more energy efficient Palladium-based membranes than the traditional energy intensive processes of pressure swing adsorption and cryogenic distillation. Membrane technology appears as an obvious energy efficient alternative for producing the ultra-pure H-2 required for fuel cells. However, membrane technology for H-2 purification has still not reached the maturity level required for its ubiquitous industrial application. This review article covers the major aspects of the current research in membrane separation technology for H-2 purification, focusing on four major types of emerging membrane technologies (carbon molecular sieve membranes; ionic-liquid based membranes; palladium-based membranes and electrochemical hydrogen pumping membranes) and establishes a comparison between them in terms of advantages and limitations.

1538,Driving factors of global carbon footprint pressure: Based on vegetation carbon sequestration,"Chen, Jiandong; Fan, Wei; Li, Ding; Liu, Xin; Song, Malin","Carbon sequestration capacity of vegetation plays an important role in global carbon emission reduction. Based on vegetation carbon sequestration, this paper establishes a carbon footprint pressure index to evaluate the carbon foot-print pressure in 60 sample countries, and discusses the driving factors that influence carbon footprint pressure in various countries through IPAT equation and Logarithmic Mean Divisia Index decomposition approach. The results indicate that the global carbon footprint pressure shows an upward trend from 2000 to 2015, mainly owing to population growth and rapid socioeconomic development; technological progress has a certain inhibitory effect on the rise of carbon footprint pressure. Furthermore, the overall carbon footprint pressure in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries shows a downward trend, while the carbon footprint pressure in non-OECD countries is rising, even exceeding the economic growth rate, which is probably related to the transfer of a large number of implied carbon emissions from OECD countries to non-OECD countries."
1539,Industrial hemp fiber: A sustainable and economical alternative to cotton,"Schumacher, Ana Gabriela Duque; Pequito, Sergio; Pazour, Jennifer","The textile industry is one of the highest polluting industries in the world. Recent studies have explored the introduction of environmentally friendly textiles to address this issue. One of these textiles is fiber derived from industrial hemp, which was recently approved for growth in the United States through the 2018 Farm Bill legislation. Motivated by hemp's potential to have a lower ecological footprint than cotton, the objective of this study is to determine if industrial hemp fiber can be produced in an economically competitive manner. Through the lenses of sustainable development and systems engineering, the basic design of the research assesses material selection decisions economically by taking a holistic supply chain view of the agricultural activities associated with industrial hemp compared to its largest competitor (i.e., cotton). With both fibers being comparable in performance, the production process of both textiles is juxtaposed, to account for interdependencies among stages with key economic and environmental considerations. As the economic cost of agricultural activities for hemp is currently uncertain in the United States, our methodology considers four main data inputs to capture the agricultural activities. First, fertilization costs are regarded as part of the cost associated with field preparations. Second, we assess the seed costs associated with cultivation. Third, the cost of irrigation (i.e., water consumption) and fourth, pest control cost represents the cost of field operations. These costs, combined with fiber yield, are used to estimate and compare the two fibers in USD per metric ton of final fiber produced. Industrial hemp is a high yield crop with (on average) 3 times more metric tons of fiber produced per hectare cultivated. Therefore, the adoption of hemp enables a reduction in cost associated with agricultural activities of 77.63%, when compared to cotton for medium total agricultural activity cost and medium yield estimates. In summary, our results suggest that industrial hemp fiber is economically viable and has the potential to be a more environmentally friendly alternative material than cotton within the textile industry.

1540,Cascading climate change impacts and implications,"Lawrence, Judy; Blackett, Paula; Cradock-Henry, Nicholas A.","Climate change is expected to have adverse impacts and implications for a range of human-environment systems. However, our understanding of the extent to which these impacts may propagate as cascades, compounding to form multiple impacts across sectors, is limited. Cascades result from interdependencies between systems and sub-systems of coupled natural and socio-economic systems in response to changes and feedback loops. The combined effects of interacting stressors may affect the ability of individuals, governments, and the private sector to adapt in time, before widespread damage occurs. We discuss the origins of cascading impacts thinking and present the results of an investigation of cascading impacts and implications in New Zealand. A participatory and collaborative approach was used through workshops and semi-structured interviews with sector informants, including engineers, local government staff, and financial risk managers and analysts from the financial services sectors. Qualitative data collection was combined with network and systems analysis to examine increased frequency of high-intensity rainfall events, sea-level rise and drought, across urban water infrastructure and the financial services, and the implications of cascading climate change impacts for governance. Results demonstrate that closer consideration of the combined effects of linked stressors can facilitate a better understanding of the scope and scale of climate change impacts. By using critical systems thinking in characterising and assessing how climate change impacts cascade across domains, we show the implications of cascades for their governance and reveal where climate change adaptation interventions might be focused. The research methods and insights into cascades provide a conceptual and practical basis for further development, which can inform the design of additional studies in other domains and jurisdictions."
1541,"Surveillance, Self-Governance, and Mortality: The Impact of Prescription Drug Monitoring Programs on U.S. Overdose Mortality, 2000-2016","Mike Vuolo,Laura C Frizzell,Brian C Kelly,Mike Vuolo,Laura C Frizzell,Brian C Kelly","Policy mechanisms shaping population health take numerous forms, from behavioral prohibitions to mandates for action to surveillance. Rising drug overdoses undermined the state's ability to promote population-level health. Using the case of prescription drug monitoring programs (PDMPs), we contend that PDMP implementation highlights state biopower operating via mechanisms of surveillance, whereby prescribers, pharmacists, and patients perceive agency despite choices being constrained. We consider whether such surveillance mechanisms are sufficient or if prescriber/dispenser access or requirements for use are necessary for population health impact. We test whether PDMPs reduced overdose mortality while considering that surveillance may require time to reach effectiveness. PDMPs reduced opioid overdose mortality 2 years postimplementation and sustained effects, with similar effects for prescription opioids, benzodiazepines, and psychostimulants. Access or mandates for action do not reduce mortality beyond surveillance. Overall, PDMP effects on overdose mortality are likely due to self-regulation under surveillance rather than mandated action."

For the first time, the sample pretreatment was achieved due to the similar acid-base status of sulfonylurea herbicides and switchable hydrophilic solvent. In the extraction step, sulfonylurea herbicides were extracted as anions and transferred to an alkaline solution with switchable hydrophilic solvent anions. In the concentration step, two types of anions were transformed to their molecular state after the aqueous solution was acidified. In addition, the dispersion and microextraction processes were completed efficiently with the simultaneous formation of analytes and extractants. The factors affecting the extraction performance were optimized. Under the optimized conditions, good linearity was observed for each herbicide with correlation coefficients ranging from 0.9952 to 0.9978. The limits of detection were in the range of 0.1-0.2 μg/g. Moreover, the relative recoveries of the sulfonylurea herbicides at spiking levels of 0.5, 1, and 1.5 μg/g in soil samples were between 75 and 111% (relative standard deviations: 0.4-11.4%). Therefore, the proposed method in this study could be successfully applied to the analysis of four types of sulfonylurea herbicides in soil samples."
1543,Risk-constrained scheduling of a CHP-based microgrid including hydrogen energy storage using robust optimization approach,"Nojavan, Sayyad; Akbari-Dibavar, Alireza; Farahmand-Zahed, Amir; Zare, Kazem","Recently, the integration of various energy resources, including renewable generation and combined heat and power (CHP) units in microgrids, has created the opportunity of off-grid operation with a suitable range of reliability. This paper presents an optimization model to schedule an islanded MG with various resources, including CHP, photovoltaic (PV), and boiler, as the primary energy provision sources besides electric battery storage, thermal storage and hydrogen energy system (HES). The HES has the power-to-hydrogen (P2H) and hydrogen-to-power (H2P) modes, which increases the flexibility of the scheduling. The uncertainty management is the most essential task in the CHP-based MGs scheduling problem, since the power and heat productions are interrelated and can result in economic losses without enough deliberations. Hence, this paper proposes the robust optimization approach (ROA) to cope with the uncertainties associated with the PV production and electric and heat load demands. The robust counterparts are applied to the deterministic problem to create a tractable adjustable robust framework. The problem is structured as a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) handled by the General Algebraic Modeling System (GAMS) using CPLEX solver. The results verified the effectiveness of the proposed robust counterparts in managing the associated risk. The results illustrated a conscious scheduling strategy under robust conditions. However, the more preserved decisions are taken, the higher operational cost is realized. In this regard, the increment of robustness level from the lowest value (deterministic condition) to the highest value (conservatism condition) increased the operation cost by about 43.29%.

Herein, a novel metallic sodium/sodium-tin alloy foil anode (Na/NaSn) with 3D interpenetrated network and porous structure is prepared through facile alloy reaction. The strong sodiophilic properties of sodium-tin alloy can lower the nucleation energy, resulting in smaller depositing potential and strong adsorption of Na+ , while synergistic effect of porous skeleton and additional potential difference (≈0.1 V) between Na and Na-Sn alloy (Na15 Sn4 ) can alleviate volume expansion, redistribute the Na-ion flux and regulate electronic field, which favors and improves homogeneous Na deposition. The as-fabricated Na/NaSn electrode can endow excellent plating/stripping reversibility at high areal capacity (over 1600 h for 4 mAh cm-2 at 1 mA cm-2 and 2 mAh cm-2 at 2 mA cm-2 ), fast electrochemical kinetics (500 h under 4 mAh cm-2 at 4 mA cm-2 ) and superior rate performances.

Therefore, exploiting an efficient method without secondary pollution is extremely urgent. Herein, a promising Ti/PbO2-Co-Pr composite electrode has been successfully fabricated through simple one-step electrodeposition for efficiently electrocatalytic degradation of BNOA. Compared with Ti/PbO2, Ti/PbO2-Co and Ti/PbO2-Pr electrodes, Ti/PbO2-Co-Pr electrode with smaller pyramidal particles possesses higher oxygen evolution potential, excellent electrochemical stability and outstanding electrocatalytic activity. The optimal degradation condition is assessed by major parameters including temperature, initial pH, current density and Na2SO4 concentration. The degradation efficiency and chemical oxygen demand removal efficiency of BNOA reach up to 94.6% and 84.6%, respectively, under optimal condition (temperature 35 degrees C, initial pH 5, current density 12 mA cm(-2), Na2SO4 concentration 8.0 g L-1 and electrolysis time 3 h). Furthermore, Ti/PbO2-Co-Pr electrode presents economic energy consumption and superior repeatability. Finally, the possible degradation mechanism of BNOA is put forward according to the main intermediate products identified by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometer. The present research paves a new path to degrade BNOA pesticide wastewater with Ti/PbO2-Co-Pr electrode. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."

The genetic background to this trait is at present poorly understood. In this study, we compared the relative gene expression levels of the Akt1s1, FGF, GH, IGF1, MSTN, TLR2, TLR4 and TLR5 genes in blood in groups of common carps (Cyprinus carpio), which belonged to different growth types and phenotypes. Fish were divided into groups based on growth rate (normal group: n = 6; slow group: n = 6) and phenotype (scaled group: n = 6; mirror group: n = 6). In the first 18 weeks, we measured significant differences (p < 0.05) between groups in terms of body weight and body length. Over the next 18 weeks, the fish in the slow group showed more intense development. In the same period, the slow group was characterized by lower expression levels for most genes, whereas GH and IGF1 mRNA levels were higher compared to the normal group. We found that phenotype was not a determining factor in differences of relative expression levels of the genes studied."

In addition, the utilisation of the digestate, through a process such as gasification, offers a circular economy approach and has the potential to enhance the deployment of power to gas systems. To this direction, the study focuses on exploring the techno-economic feasibility of coupling biomethanation with digestate gasification for the wastewater industry. The study constitutes the first endeavour to assess the viability of such an integrated energy system. Four different scenarios have been designed and assessed. The energy efficiency of the concepts lies between 26.5% and 35.5% while the minimum selling price (MSP) of biomethane is in the range of 135-183 pound/MWh. The implementation of appropriate policy mechanisms and the inclusion of by-products revenues reduces the MSPs by approximately 32%-42%. The conduction of a typical sensitivity analysis has identified the electricity price as the prime cost driver and this is followed by the cost of the electrolyser or the gasification plant depending on the scenario. Finally, a 2030 analysis, that incorporates projected techno-economic advances, has been carried out and revealed that under certain circumstances profits can be generated."

Support measures for mobile working were implemented and supported by a company works agreement. A longitudinal survey is conducted to accompany these measures. The first results of the first survey are presented here. The aim of this survey is to compare the pre-Corona working situation without home office (2/2020) with the working situation during Corona-after the introduction of home office (10/2020). 68 people took part in the anonymous online survey. 41.2% of the participants work exclusively in the office, the remainder works partly/completely from home. Half of the latter do this due to a direct order. In the course of a retrospective survey the following becomes evident. 91.0% score occupational safety as equal or better. The participants save an average of 2.3 h per week. Small negative effects can be observed in the exchange of information and availability (Cohen's d both -0.27). The desire to exchange ideas privately with colleagues increases to a small extent (Cohen's d = 0.22). There is no increase in delimitation and overtime by colleagues. An effect of close to medium strength can be seen in the work-life balance (Cohen's d = 0.49); satisfaction increases here. A medium effect towards an improvement can be found in undisturbed work (Cohen's d = 0.66). The result shows a small effect in terms of increasing satisfaction with the work situation (Cohen's d = 0.24). 85.3% state that they can do the job equally well or better in October than in February. Due to the altered situation participants will save an average of 5.9 km of travel per week.Practical Relevance: Improved understanding of the advantages and disadvantages of switching to mobile working in a medium-sized company."
1549,Testing the EKC hypothesis for the top six hydropower energy-consuming countries: Evidence from Fourier Bootstrap ARDL procedure,"Pata, Ugur Korkut; Aydin, Mucahit","Environmental degradation is an important threat to sustainable development. Economic growth and fossil fuel-based energy consumption are main factors causing environmental pollution. The use of renewable energy as an alternative for fossil fuels can help to reduce environmental pollution, and thus, sustainable development can be achieved. From this point of view, hydropower is the most widely used renewable energy source in several countries. However, the effects of hydropower energy on the environment are controversial. To add a new dimension to the discussion, this study investigates the relationship between hydropower energy consumption, ecological footprint and economic growth for the top six hydropower-consuming countries within the framework of the environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) hypothesis. The study employs newly developed cointegration and causality tests with smooth structural changes over the period 1965-2016. The findings of the Fourier bootstrap ARDL procedure demonstrate that no cointegration exist between the variables. Therefore, the EKC hypothesis is not valid for Brazil, China, Canada, India, Norway and the US. Furthermore, the findings of the Fourier Toda-Yamamoto causality test suggest unidirectional causality running from hydropower energy consumption to economic growth in Brazil, and bidirectional causality between these variables in China. In the case of the top six hydropower-consuming countries, no evidence was found for a causal relationship between hydropower energy and ecological footprint. Overall, these results are important for policy makers. Hydropower energy plays a crucial role in China and Brazil's economic growth policies. On the other hand, hydropower energy consumption and economic growth do not have a role in mitigating the ecological footprint in six countries. For this reason, different types of renewable energy consumption should be taken into consideration by countries for the solution of environmental problems. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

1550,Coal-to-gas heating compensation standard and willingness to make clean energy choices in typical rural areas of northern China,"Yan, Yutong; Jiao, Wenxian; Wang, Kang; Huang, Yatao; Chen, Jingyang; Han, Qingfeng","The implementation of the coal-to-gas (C2G) project is the key to achieving the transition to clean energy and improving air quality in rural areas in the north of China. Based on the survey data of 374 households in the town of Mishan, which is in the city of Jincheng in Shanxi Province, the C2G heating compensation standard was calculated using the minimum data method, and the key factors affecting farmers' choice of clean energy were analyzed using logistic regression models. The results were as follows. (i) The C2G project almost doubled the heating expenditure of farmers. (ii) When the compensation standard increased, the ratio of newly added C2G heating area and newly reduced pollutant emissions increased non-linearly. To achieve an environmental goal of reducing particulate matter by 40%, the government will need to compensate each household by 3.56 CNY/m(2) per month, which is 1.35 times the current compensation standard. When the monthly compensation is 9 CNY/m(2), the comprehensive best economic and environmental benefits can be achieved. (iii) The per capita annual income of households and the permanent population of households are the most significant variables affecting farmers' choice of clean energy. Introducing environmental perception variables, such as adaptive efficacy perception and self-efficacy perception, can help to identify the willingness of farmers to choose clean energy."
1551,"Challenges for Connecting Citizens and Smart Cities: ICT, E-Governance and Blockchain","Oliveira, Thays A.; Oliver, Miguel; Ramalhinho, Helena","The way citizens interact with cities affects overall life quality. Their participation in social decisions is of paramount importance for helping on public decisions that affect governance, regulation and education. This interaction has the potential of being boosted within the scope of smart and digital cities, especially by recent advances in blockchain technology. This work introduces insights about how smart cities' concepts and innovative technologies can help society to face daily challenges for improving citizens' awareness. Digital technologies are able to drive social and economic development by employing Information and Communication Technology (ICT) to promote innovation. In this context, e-governance, in conjunction with disruptive concepts such as blockchain, is showing up as a fundamental tool for a decentralized democracy. This study reviews, discusses, raises open points and presents suggestions towards an efficient, transparent and sustainable use of technology, applied to future cities."
1552,"Imaging Markers of Vascular Brain Health: Quantification, Clinical Implications, and Future Directions","Prashanthi Vemuri,Charles Decarli,Marco Duering,Prashanthi Vemuri,Charles Decarli,Marco Duering","Cerebrovascular disease (CVD) manifests through a broad spectrum of mechanisms that negatively impact brain and cognitive health. Oftentimes, CVD changes (excluding acute stroke) are insufficiently considered in aging and dementia studies which can lead to an incomplete picture of the etiologies contributing to the burden of cognitive impairment. Our goal with this focused review is 3-fold. First, we provide a research update on the current magnetic resonance imaging methods that can measure CVD lesions as well as early CVD-related brain injury specifically related to small vessel disease. Second, we discuss the clinical implications and relevance of these CVD imaging markers for cognitive decline, incident dementia, and disease progression in Alzheimer disease, and Alzheimer-related dementias. Finally, we present our perspective on the outlook and challenges that remain in the field. With the increased research interest in this area, we believe that reliable CVD imaging biomarkers for aging and dementia studies are on the horizon."
1553,"Urban drought vulnerability assessment ? A framework to integrate socio- economic, physical, and policy index in a vulnerability contribution analysis","Wang, Peng; Qiao, Wenhui; Wang, Yuyi; Cao, Shuchao; Zhang, Yuhu","The frequent occurrence of drought seriously hinders urban sustainable development. Decreasing urban drought and reducing drought risk entails a good understanding of urban drought vulnerability (UDV). Based on physical, socio-economic, and political indicators, this study evaluated and analyzed the urban drought vulnerability in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH) region from the following aspects: spatio-temporal analysis and contribution analysis. Results indicated that (1) the UDV of 13 cities kept increasing from 1990 to 2016. By 2016, 13 cities were highly vulnerable; (2) social and economic factors were considered as the main factors contributing to high drought vulnerability; and (3) public budget expenditure, GDP, and indicators related to education significantly contributed to UDV. This study provides a theoretical basis for the government to manage drought."
1554,Feasibility of coronary blood flow simulations using mid-fidelity numeric and geometric models,"L A Mansilla Alvarez,C A Bulant,G D Ares,R A Feijóo,P J Blanco,L A Mansilla Alvarez,C A Bulant,G D Ares,R A Feijóo,P J Blanco","The fractional flow reserve index (FFR) is currently used as a gold standard to quantify coronary stenosis's functional relevance. Due to its highly invasive nature, the development of noninvasive surrogates based on simulations has drawn much attention in recent years, emphasizing efficient strategies that enable translational research. The focus of this work is twofold. First, to assess the feasibility of using a mid-fidelity numerical strategy (transversally enriched pipe element method, TEPEM), placed between low- and high-fidelity models, for the estimation of flow-related quantities, such as FFR and wall shear stress (WSS). Low-fidelity models, as zero- or one-dimensional models, are computationally inexpensive but in detriment of poorer spatially detailed predictions. On the other hand, high-fidelity models, such as classical three-dimensional numerical approximations, can provide detailed predictions but their transition to clinical application is prohibitive due to high computational costs. As a second goal, we quantify the impact of the length of lateral branches in the blood flow through the interrogated vessel of interest to further reduce the computational burden. Both studies are addressed considering a cohort of 17 coronary geometries. A total of 20 locations were selected to estimate the FFR index for a wide range of Coronary Flow Reserve (CFR) scenarios. Numerical results suggest that the mid-fidelity TEPEM model is a reliable approach for the efficient estimation of the FFR index and WSS, with an error in the order of [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text], respectively, when compared to the high-fidelity prediction. Moreover, such mid-fidelity models require much less computational resources, in compliance with infrastructure frequently available in the clinic, by achieving a speedup between 30 and 60 times compared to a conventional finite element approach. Also, we show that shortening peripheral branches does not introduce considerable perturbations either in the flow patterns, in the wall shear stress, or the pressure drop. Comparing the different geometric models, the error in the estimation of FFR index and WSS is reduced to less than [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text], respectively."
1555,Will land transport infrastructure affect the energy and carbon dioxide emissions performance of China's manufacturing industry?,"Lin, Boqiang; Chen, Yu","The energy consumption and carbon dioxide emissions of China's manufacturing industry accounted for 12.8% and 15.5% of the world in 2016, respectively. On the other hand, the construction of land transport infrastructure has become the focal point of the Chinese government recently. However, there is very little literature investigating the influencing mechanism of land transport infrastructure on the energy and environmental efficiency of the sector. Therefore, it is crucial and meaningful to study how the latter is affected by the land transport infrastructure to alleviate global energy and environmental issues. Non-radial directional distance function was used to calculate two indicators measuring energy and carbon dioxide emissions performance in this paper. The panel Tobit model was then applied to focus on factors affecting the performance. The results indicate that land transport infrastructure, economic growth, technological progress, energy prices, industrial structure have significant impacts on the energy and environmental efficiency of China's manufacturing industry. Different from the results at the national level, from a regional perspective, the development of land transport infrastructure in the eastern region plays a negative role in the performance of the manufacturing industry. Finally, some targeted policy recommendations are proposed to improve the policy design of the government."
1556,Land use transitions and the associated impacts on ecosystem services in the Middle Reaches of the Yangtze River Economic Belt in China based on the geo-informatic Tupu method,"Chen, Wanxu; Zhao, Hongbo; Li, Jiangfeng; Zhu, Lijun; Wang, Zheye; Zeng, Jie","Rapid urbanization in China has greatly exacerbated land use transitions (LUTs), which seriously threaten the ecosystem. The existing literature lacks information on the spatio-temporal analysis of LUTs, and assessments of ecosystem services remain incomplete. This lack of information may limit the formation and implementation of landscape plans and ecologically oriented policies. This study attempts to fill this gap by analysing the geographic features of LUTs with the geo-informatic Tupu method and exploring the responses of ecosystem services to LUTs. A newly revised benefit transfer method that utilizes the land use/land cover change data derived from the Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM) in the Middle Reaches of the Yangtze River Economic Belt (MRYREB) is implemented. The results indicate that the area of construction land continued to increase markedly, while the area of cultivated land declined continuously from 1995 to 2015. This increase in construction land was mainly derived from the occupation of cultivated land. The Tupu units of ""forestland > cultivated land,"" ""cultivated land > forestland,"" ""cultivated land -> water area,"" and ""water area -> cultivated land"" were the dominant driving forces of the changes in ecosystem services value (ESV) in the MRYREB. Hotspots of ESV changes were mainly located in the surrounding mountainous areas during 1995-2005 and 2005-2010, while the coldspots during 2010-2015 were mainly located in the plains. The findings in this study have important implications for ecosystem conservation, ecological function zoning, ecological compensation decision-making, and related land development in the MRYREB.

Methods: This research evaluated Italian dentists from 11 to 18 April 2020, using a questionnaire submitted via Google Forms (Alphabet, Mountain View, CA, USA). It consisted of different investigations about sociodemographic aspects, profession-related characteristics, knowledge about COVID-19 infection transmission modalities, symptoms, and attitude in treating potentially infected patients. Statistical analysis was performed using the Pearson chi(2) test and Student t-test. The alpha-level was fixed at p = 0.05. All data were analyzed with STATA 16 (StataCorp LP, College Station, TX, USA). Results: 1500 dentists (664 men and 836 women) completed the questionnaire. The majority of respondents declared having been trained in infection prevention procedures (64.3%) but not specifically to prevent the spread of COVID-19 (48.7%). A total of 57.2% declared that they were not trained sufficiently to restart working after lockdown, with a significantly higher prevalence (Pearson chi(2) test, p < 0.001) among women (62.3%) than men (50.9%). Conclusion: Italian dentists were informed correctly on the mode of transmission but partially missed COVID-19 symptoms. Dentists considered the virus infection highly dangerous, and they were not confident in being able to work safely. The lack of precise operating guidelines creates uncertainties on infection control measures and appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) use. The participants revealed apprehension for their health and the current and future economic situation of their practices."

The alternative treatment for drug-resistant infections is Nano formulation-based antimicrobial agents. The plant extract of Conocarpus Lancifolius fruits was used to synthesize silver nanoparticles in the current study, and it was further employed as an antimicrobial and anticancer agent. Nanoparticles have been characterized by UV-visible spectrometer revealed the notable peak of λmax = 410-442 nm, which confirms the reduction of silver ion to elemental silver nanoparticles, and the biological moieties in the synthesis were further confirmed by FTIR analysis. The stability and crystalline nature of materials were approved by XRD analysis and expected the size of the nanomaterials of 21 to 173 nm analyzed by a nanophox particle-size analyzer. In vitro, synthesized materials act as an antibacterial agent against Streptococcus pneumonia and Staphylococcus aureus. The inhibition zones of 18 and 24 mm have been estimated to be antibacterial activity against both bacteria. The potency of up to 100% of AgNPs for bacterial strains was incubated overnight at 60 μg/ml. Based on our results, biogenic AgNPs reveal significant activity against fungal pathogen Rhizopusus stolonifera and Aspergillus flavus that cause leading infectious diseases. Additionally, nanomaterials were biocompatible and demonstrated the potential anticancer activities against MDA MB-231 cells after 24-hour exposure."
1559,The role of electricity in decarbonizing European road transport - Development and assessment of an integrated multi-sectoral model,"Helgeson, Broghan; Peter, Jakob","Despite regulation efforts, CO2 emissions from European road transport have continued to rise. Increased use of electricity offers a promising decarbonization option, both to fuel electric vehicles and run power-to-x systems producing synthetic fuels. To understand the economic implications of increased coupling of the road transport and electricity sectors, an integrated multi-sectoral partial-equilibrium investment and dispatch model is developed for the European electricity and road transport sectors, linked by an energy transformation module to endogenously account for, e.g., increasing electricity consumption and flexibility provision from electric vehicles and power-to-x systems. The model is applied to analyze the effects of sector-specific CO2 reduction targets on the vehicle, electricity and power-to-x technology mix as well as trade flows of power-to-x fuels in European countries from 2020 to 2050. The results show that, by 2050, the fuel shares of electricity and power-to-x fuels in the European road transport sector reach 37% and 27%, respectively, creating an additional electricity demand of 1200 TWh in Europe. To assess the added value of the integrated modeling approach, an additional analysis is performed in which all endogenous ties between sectors are removed. The results show that by decoupling the two sectors, the total system costs may be significantly overestimated and the production costs of power-to-x fuels may be inaccurately approximated, which may affect the merit order of decarbonization options."
1560,From hot rock to useful energy: A global estimate of enhanced geothermal systems potential,"Aghahosseini, Arman; Breyer, Christian","This study demonstrates the theoretical, technical, optimal economic and sustainable potential of enhanced geothermal systems (EGS) globally. A global estimate of EGS is presented in a 1 degrees x1 degrees spatial resolution. Constructed temperature at depth maps are computed for every 1 km thick layer, from 1 to 10 km. Multiple factors such as surface heat flow, thermal conductivity, radioactive heat production, and surface temperature are involved, and obtained from various sources and assumptions. The global EGS theoretical potential is assessed. Available heat content is then estimated using technical constraints for the temperature equal to or higher than 150 degrees C for any 1 km depth, and presented as thermal energy and electrical power capacity. The EGS optimal economic potential is derived from the optimum depth and the corresponding minimum levelised cost of electricity. The global optimal economic potential in terms of power capacity is found to be about 6 and 108 TWe for the cost years of 2030 and 2050, respectively. If economic and water stress constraints are excluded, the global EGS potential can be as much as 200 TWe. Further, an industrial cost curve is developed for the levelised cost of electricity as a function of EGS technical power capacity. The findings indicate that around 4600 GW(e) of EGS capacity can be built at a cost of 50 (sic)/MWh or lower. A method is applied to measure the sustainable geothermal resource base. The obtained sustainable potential is found to be 256 GWe in 2050. Results are presented on a country basis and globally."
1561,"Perceptions of ecosystem services, disservices and willingness-to-pay for urban green space conservation","Tian, Yuqing; Wu, Hongjuan; Zhang, Guangshi; Wang, Luocen; Zheng, Duo; Li, Sen","While planning and management of urban green space (UGS) remain primarily driven by policymakers and expert knowledge, increasing attention has been paid to the general public's perception of and demand for UGS. This study was conducted to provide price-related outcomes to support UGS-related decision making and achieve an improved understanding of the causal relationships underpinning the residents' willingness-to-pay (WTP) for UGS conservation. An extensive survey with 3000 urban residents from three provincial capital cities In central China (i.e., Wuhan, Changsha and Nanchang) was conducted. We applied structural equation modelling to examine a range of hypothetical causal relationships among residents' perceptions about ecosystem services/disservices provided by UGS, frequency of UGS visits, socioeconomic status (SES) and WTP for the conservation of five different types of UGS. We found that residents had an average WTP of 202.4 CNY or 30.6 USD per year cross UGS types, with the attached green space having the greatest WTP (223.0 CNY or 33.7 USD per year), followed by park (215.4 CNY or 32.6 USD year), square (201.7 CNY or 30.5 USD year), suburban ecological (190.1 CNY or 28.7 USD year) and protective (182.0 CNY or 27.5 USD year) green spaces. Perceptions of UGS's ecosystem services had a positive causal impact on WTP, while perceptions of ecosystem disservices would have a negative impact. The frequency of UGS visits was found to amplify WTP at a limited level. It could further heighten and diminish the perceptions of ecosystem services and disservices. Participants with higher SES typically had greater perceptions of UGS's ecosystem services and WTP. Finally, we found that the structure of the causal relationships on WTP varied between cities, highlighting the importance of considering the fine-level impacts of biophysical environment jointly. Our results could help urban planners to understand better the ways urban green space was perceived and anticipate the likely effects of changing spatial patterns of UGS on the benefits and nuisances experienced by the general public."
1562,"Government R&D Subsidies, Environmental Regulations, and Their Effect on Green Innovation Efficiency of Manufacturing Industry: Evidence from the Yangtze River Economic Belt of China","Yi, Ming; Wang, Yiqian; Yan, Modan; Fu, Lina; Zhang, Yao","The Yangtze River Economic Belt is the most important manufacturing economic belt in China. The level of manufacturing green innovation efficiency of the Yangtze River Economic Belt directly affects the overall competitiveness of China's manufacturing industry. With panel data from 11 provinces and cities along the Yangtze River Economic Belt in China for the period of 2008 to 2017, this paper applies the slacks-based measure (SBM)-data envelopment analysis (DEA) model and panel Tobit model to conduct an empirical study of the effects of government research and development subsidies and environmental regulations on the green innovation efficiency of the manufacturing industry of the Yangtze River Economic Belt. The results show that, firstly, government R&D subsidies and environmental regulations are both conducive to improving the green innovation efficiency of the manufacturing industry of the Yangtze River Economic Belt; secondly, because of the fact that the interaction terms between government R&D subsidies and environmental regulations failed to pass the significance test, the positive moderating effects of R&D subsidies on environmental regulations and green innovation efficiency of the manufacturing industry are not obvious; thirdly, in terms of control variables, strengthening agglomeration is the only factor that is positively correlated with green innovation efficiency improvement of the manufacturing industry. Enterprise scale and industrial structure have negative effects on green innovation efficiency improvement, and the openness of economy has no correlation with green innovation efficiency."

It can be prepared by direct laser writing on some polymer materials in the air. Because of its features of simplicity, fast production, and excellent physicochemical properties, it was widely used in medical sensing devices. This minireview gives an overview of the characteristics of LIG and LIG-driven sensors. Various methods for preparing graphene were compared and discussed. The applications of the LIG in biochemical sensors for ions, small molecules, microRNA, protein, and cell detection were highlighted. LIG-based physical physiological sensors and wearable electronics for medical applications were also included. Finally, our insights into current challenges and prospects for LIG-based medical sensing devices were presented."
1564,Transformation towards Circular Economy (CE) in Municipal Waste Management System: Model Solutions for Poland,"Smol, Marzena; Duda, Joanna; Czaplicka-Kotas, Agnieszka; Szoldrowska, Dominika","Municipal waste management has been an area of special interest for the European Commission (EC) for many years, especially in the transformation process towards a circular economy (CE), which is a priority of the European Union's (EU's) economic policy. This paper presents the overview of the Polish waste management system (WMS) and the CE-related tasks indicated in the Polish CE Roadmap. Despite the fact that Poland is one of the countries that generates the least waste per capita (329 kg in 2018) in the EU (489 kg), it still has problems with adapting the levels of municipal waste recycling to European requirements (34.3% in 2018, EU average 47%), which result from the lack of sufficient infrastructure for waste management and the insufficiently developed public awareness and behaviors. The current paper presents an inventory of the recommended actions, which support transformation towards CE in municipal waste management. These actions have been grouped into six core principles of circularity, indicated in the ReSOLVE framework: Regenerate, Share, Optimize, Loop, Virtualize, and Exchange. In each of presented areas, recommended tasks and actions were identified that should be taken by governments and residents themselves, such as landfill remediation, use of selected municipal waste fractions for economic purposes, sharing products with co-users, waste recovery, remanufacturing products or components, virtual solutions in everyday life to reduce the amount of generated waste, or replacement of household appliances by items with a higher energy class. An implementation of specific actions indicated in the paper could positively influence transformation towards CE in Poland. Because the presented examples of actions are model solutions, they can also be used in other countries and regions."

The proposed models extend the conventional accelerated failure time model by allowing time-to-event responses to be subject to measurement errors. We describe two measurement error models, a logarithm transformation regression measurement error model and an additive error model with a positive increment, to delineate possible scenarios of measurement error in time-to-event outcomes. We develop Bayesian approaches to conduct statistical inference. Efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms are developed to facilitate the posterior inference. Extensive simulation studies are conducted to assess the performance of the proposed method, and an application to a study of Alzheimer's disease is presented."

Metabolic alterations such as hyperglycemia, insulin resistance, hyperinsulinemia, and increased metabolism of free fatty acids result in oxidative stress, inflammation, advanced glycation end products formation, abnormalities in calcium homeostasis, and apoptosis that are responsible for structural remodeling. Cardiac stiffness, hypertrophy, and fibrosis eventually lead to dysfunction and HF with preserved ejection fraction and/or HF with reduced ejection fraction. In this review, we analyzed in detail the cellular and molecular mechanisms and the metabolic pathways involved in the pathophysiology of DCM. Different phenotypes are observed in DCM, and it is not clear yet if the restrictive and the dilated phenotypes are distinct or represent an evolution of the same disease. Phenotypic differences can be observed between T1DM and T2DM DCM, possibly explained by the different myocardial insulin action. Further studies are needed in order to better understand the underlying mechanisms of DCM and to identify appropriate therapeutic targets and novel strategies to prevent and reverse the progression toward heart failure in diabetic patients."
1568,"Energy consumption, economic expansion, and CO2 emission in the UK: The role of economic policy uncertainty","Adedoyin, Festus Fatai; Zakari, Abdulrasheed","On the 23rd of June 2016, the United Kingdom voted to leave the EU, leading to months and years of economic policy uncertainties. Such uncertainties have not only characterized the UK but have become a center point for energy debate in recent times. Given the foregoing, this paper progresses to provide evidence on the role of Economic Policy Uncertainty in the Energy Consumption - Emission nexus in the UK. We use annual data spanning the period of 1985-2017 for the UK for CO2 emissions in tons per capita (CO2), real GDP (RGDP), energy use (EU), and economic policy uncertainty (EPU). The Autoregressive distributed lag model (ARDL) bound test is used to test the fitness of the model in the short and long term. Our model shows that EPU matters most in the short run, as it reduces the growth of CO2 emissions, while prolonged use of EPU in the UK, exhibit controversial influence, where CO2 emissions continue to rise. In addition, pairwise Granger causality shows a one-way causality running from energy use to CO2 emissions, CO2 emissions to economic policy uncertainty, and also from energy use to economic policy uncertainty. However, two-ways causality is found between real GDP and real GDP per capita. Overall, our results imply that EPU is likely to yield a positive effect on climate change for a short time, but continue dependent will, in the long run, create an unhealthy environment. We suggest that the UK government should consider implementing an additional long-run policy that will supplement the effort of EPU. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."
1569,Delirium and COVID-19: a narrative review of emerging evidence,"L White,T Jackson,L White,T Jackson","Delirium is a common condition affecting hospital inpatients, including those having surgery and on the intensive care unit. Delirium is also common in patients with COVID-19 in hospital settings, and the occurrence is higher than expected for similar infections. The short-term outcomes of those with COVID-19 delirium are similar to that of classical delirium and include increased length of stay and increased mortality. Management of delirium in COVID-19 in the context of a global pandemic is limited by the severity of the syndrome and compounded by the environmental constraints. Practical management includes effective screening, early identification and appropriate treatment aimed at minimising complications and timely escalation decisions. The pandemic has played out on the national stage and the effect of delirium on patients, relatives and healthcare workers remains unknown but evidence from the previous SARS outbreak suggests there may be long-lasting psychological damage."

However, the consequences of long-term/repeated treatments with the combinations in cancer models remain unclear. In this study, the synergistic cytotoxicity of their combinations in 8 tumor cell lines was confirmed in a 7-day exposure mode. Then, pancreatic Capan-1 cells were repeatedly treated with the PARP1 inhibitor olaparib, the Chk1 inhibitor rabusertib or their combination for 211-214 days, during which the changes in drug sensitivity were monitored at a 35-day interval. Unexpectedly, among the 3 treatment modes, the combination treatments resulted in the highest-grade resistance to Chk1 (~14.6 fold) and PARP1 (~420.2 fold) inhibitors, respectively. Consistently, G2/M arrest and apoptosis decreased significantly in the resulting resistant variants exposed to olaparib. All 3 resistant variants also unexpectedly obtained enhanced migratory and invasive capabilities. Moreover, the combination treatments resulted in increased migration and invasion than olaparib alone. The expression of 124 genes changed significantly in all the resistant variants. We further demonstrate that activating CXCL3-ERK1/2 signaling might contribute to the enhanced migratory capabilities rather than the acquired drug resistance. Our findings indicate that repeated treatments with the rabusertib/olaparib combination result in increased drug resistance and a more aggressive cell phenotype than those with either single agent, providing new clues for future clinical anticancer tests of PARP1 and Chk1 inhibitor combinations."

1573,Multi-scenario operation optimization model for park integrated energy system based on multi-energy demand response,"Tan, Zhongfu; Yang, Shenbo; Lin, Hongyu; De, Gejirifu; Ju, Liwei; Zhou, Feng'ao","Multi-energy demand response is an important means to achieve peak load shifting, and improve energy efficiency. It plays a significant role in promoting the sustainable development of park integrated energy system. In this context, we first constructed a mull-energy demand response model from the perspective of an elastic matrix. Second, we established performance evaluation indexes of the park integrated energy system based on economic and environmental factors, to match energy supply and demand. We then constructed an optimization model considering the unit output, energy balance, and other constraints to achieve optimal net profits, energy utilization efficiency, and degree of matching between load and output. Finally, we established multiple scenarios and used the multi-objective particle swarm optimization algorithm combined with fuzzy set theory for an example analysis. The results show that after redesigning the cooling, heating, and electricity prices, the multi-energy demand response model transfers the user load demand, without changing the total energy consumption. Compared with the traditional scenario, the energy utilization efficiency and net system profit increased by 2.30 % and $2,652.775, respectively, while the user expenditure decreased by $7,663.887, following implementation of the demand response model. This demonstrates win-win situations for the economy/environment and for the system/users."
1574,Microemulsion-Confined Assembly of Magnetic Nanoclusters for pH/H2O2 Dual-Responsive T2-T1 Switchable MRI,"Wei Liu,Sheng-Yan Yin,Yingcai Hu,Ting Deng,Jishan Li,Wei Liu,Sheng-Yan Yin,Yingcai Hu,Ting Deng,Jishan Li","In this work, a T2-T1 switchable superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoprobe with a pH/H2O2 dual response was obtained using a microemulsion method. This novel method for the controllable assembly of small iron clusters followed by their independent modification was reported, which could not be prepared by common synthetic methods. The size of the assembled nanoprobe was uniform and controllable, with a stable T2 magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) signal under a single condition. When the nanoprobe was exposed to the tumor environment, the higher H+ and H2O2 concentrations at the tumor site could dissociate the nanoprobe and redisperse into small iron clusters. When this occurred, the T2 MRI signal was converted into a T1 MRI signal, achieving specific detection of tumors by a pH/H2O2 dual-response T2-T1 MRI."
1575,Vascular adhesion protein-1 and microvascular diabetic complications,"Alok D Singh,Yogesh A Kulkarni,Alok D Singh,Yogesh A Kulkarni","Vascular adhesion protein-1 (VAP-1) is a bifunctional protein that has the ability to catalyze the deamination of primary amines and is involved in the production of hydrogen peroxide, aldehydes, and advanced glycation end products (AGEs). VAP-1 is usually stored in intracellular vesicles of endothelial cells, smooth muscles, and adipocytes. It is responsible for leukocyte transmigration and adhesion. Overexpression of VAP-1 exacerbates oxidative stress and modulates a variety of inflammatory mediators linked with diabetic complications. Numerous studies have suggested the association of increased insulin levels with serum VAP-1 (sVAP-1). Preclinical research evidence suggests the increased activity of sVAP-1 in type 1 and 2 diabetes. Scientific reports on VAP-1 inhibitors have shown a reduction in severity in diabetic animal models. VAP-1 is a potential target of a therapeutically effective line of treatment for diabetes and diabetic complications such as nephropathy and retinopathy. The primary focus of this review is the role of VAP-1 in diabetes and its associated microvascular complications."
1576,Energy access during and post-COVID-19 pandemic in sub-Saharan countries: the case of Ethiopia,"Yohannes Biru Aemro,Pedro Moura,Aníbal T de Almeida,Yohannes Biru Aemro,Pedro Moura,Aníbal T de Almeida","The global COVID-19 pandemic causes hundreds of thousands of deaths and has created a catastrophic economic and health crisis around the World. Transportation, manufacturing industries, business and people's movement came to almost a halt and sharp oil and gas prices reduction were observed. The impact of the pandemic for sub-Saharan countries like Ethiopia, which was already struggling with many economic and social welfare problems, is more evident than in other wealthy nations around the World. In Ethiopia, the general energy access rate is 44% and in healthcare facilities is only about 10%. Therefore, the response for the COVID-19 pandemic is challenging, since activities such as information sharing, communication with health centers, diagnosis and medical treatment require electricity access. This paper aims to assess the impact of the pandemic on energy access plans during and post-pandemic. The paper analyzed, the status of the current COVID-19 outbreak in Ethiopia, the energy access situation in health facilities, and the impacts of COVID-19 on energy access during and post-pandemic periods. Data related to the universal energy access plan of Ethiopia, the impact of energy access on healthcare services and the impact of the pandemic were reviewed for the assessment. The analysis indicates that the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in Ethiopian healthcare facilities and on the overall universal energy access plan is immense and to minimize the global impact short and long-term policy responses are identified and urgently recommended. Furthermore, powering healthcare facilities with microgrids composed of solar panels and battery storage systems could be one cost-effective and sustainable solution for the speedy and effective response of the pandemic challenges."
1577,Ranking European countries on the basis of their environmental and circular economy performance: A DEA application in MSW,"Giannakitsidou, Olga; Giannikos, Ioannis; Chondrou, Anastasia","The scope of this research is to present a more holistic approach on measuring countries' performance in managing and exploiting their Municipal Solid Waste (MSW). Specifically, we argue that relying solely on criteria like the recycling and/or the cyclical material use rate, can lead to an overestimation or underestimation of countries' true performance. That is because the level of waste generation is left unaccounted, despite the fact that low waste generation is an important environmental target, and so is the countries' true potential, as it is reflected by their economic and social progress. Instead, we measure the environmental and circular economy performance of 26 European Union countries by implementing Data Envelopment Analysis and tackle the aforementioned problem by using the generated quantity of MSW per capita and the three dimensions of the Social Progress Index as inputs and the recycling and/or the cyclical material use rate as outputs. We do so, using a basic framework and a framework that imposes common weights to enforce a full ranking of the countries. Our study shows large disparities among European countries, with respect to their performance. Interestingly though, the borders between Western and Eastern Europe have fallen, but not those between the north and the south: old EU members, such as Spain or France, perform significantly worst, both from an environmental and a circular economy perspective, than newer members, such as Slovenia or Poland. Finally, Belgium has been revealed as the best performer, both from an environmental and a cyclical economy perspective. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."

1579,B cell repertoire in patients with a novel BTK mutation: expanding the spectrum of atypical X-linked agammaglobulinemia,"Ori Toker,Arnon Broides,Atar Lev,Amos J Simon,Orli Megged,Oded Shamriz,Yuval Tal,Raz Somech,Yu Nee Lee,Amit Nahum,Ori Toker,Arnon Broides,Atar Lev,Amos J Simon,Orli Megged,Oded Shamriz,Yuval Tal,Raz Somech,Yu Nee Lee,Amit Nahum","X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA) is caused by mutations in the Bruton tyrosine kinase) BTK) gene. Affected patients have severely reduced amounts of circulating B cells. Patients with atypical XLA may have residual circulating B cells, and there are few studies exploring these cells' repertoire. We aimed to study the B cell repertoire of a novel hypomorphic mutation in the BTK gene, using the next generation sequencing (NGS) technology. Clinical data was collected from our clinical records. Real-time PCR was used to determine KREC copies, and NGS was used to determine the immunoglobulin (Ig) heavy chain (IgH) repertoire diversity. Both patients had a relatively mild clinical and laboratory phenotype, residual BTK protein expression, and the same novel mutation in the BTK gene, c.1841 T > C, p. L614P. Signal-joint kappa-deleting recombination excision circles (sj-KREC) for both patients were completely absent reflecting lack of naïve B cells. The intron RSS-Kde coding joints (cj) were significantly reduced, reflecting residual replicating B cells. NGS displayed restricted IgH repertoire with highly uneven distribution of clones, especially for Pt2. We report a novel BTK mutation, c.1841 T > C (p. L614P) that is associated with a relatively mild phenotype. We conclude that the IgH repertoire in atypical XLA is restricted with highly uneven distribution of clones. This phenomenon may be explained by extremely reduced to non-existent levels of BTK in B cells. This report sheds further light on atypical cases of XLA."

However, the optimal dosing has not been well defined. Our protocol aims for a 5-6 mg/kg cumulative dose. It is unclear if a dose lower than 5 mg/kg is associated with more rejection. We performed a retrospective cohort study of patients who received a kidney transplant at our center between January 1, 2013 and December 31, 2016. Primary outcome was biopsy proven acute rejection (clinical and subclinical) in the first 6 months after kidney transplant. CMV viremia in high risk (D+/R-) recipients and BK viremia was compared as a secondary endpoint. Of the 543 patients, the Low Dose (LD) group (n = 56) received <5 mg/kg ATG and Regular Dose (RD) group (n = 487) received ≧5 mg/kg. Patients in RD were more sensitized (higher PRA and CPRA). LD received a dose of 4 ± 1.1 mg/kg ATG whereas RD received 5.6 ± .3 mg/kg ATG (P < .001). TCMR (Banff 1A or greater) was present in 34% of patients in LD versus 22% in RD (P = .04) (OR 2.1; 95%CI 1.12-3.81; P = .019). There was no difference in the incidence of CMV or BK viremia. ATG doses lower than 5 mg/kg may be associated with a heightened risk of rejection despite a low degree of sensitization."
1581,"Sustainable development and environmental restoration in Lake Erhai, China","Lin, Song-Shun; Shen, Shui-Long; Zhou, Annan; Lyu, Hai-Min","Eutrophication of lakes is an environmental issue that has attracted increasing attention all over the world. This study analyses the monitoring data of the Lake Erhai, Yunnan Province in China with Carlson's TSI, Improving Carlson's TSI (TSIM) and TLI. The results reveal that the eutrophication index for this lake is in the Mesotrophic status. The mechanism of the eutrophication in Lake Erhai is also investigated. The mechanism shows that rate of nutrient transformation is the core issue and the process of eutrophic evolution involves natural, social, and economic factors. The restrictions on sustainable development in Lake Erhai are discussed. To maintain sustainable development, green watershed construction (GWC) and its corresponding effective measures are proposed. Moreover, lessons learned from Lake Erhai watershed management are presented, to provide valuable experiences for alleviating water pollution caused by insufficient environmental management during rapid economic development.

1582,A one-step platform for screening high-efficient and minimal off-target CRISPR/Cas13 crRNAs to eradicate SARS-CoV-2 virus for treatment of COVID-19 patients,"Pu-Yu Li,San-Qiang Li,She-Gan Gao,Dao-Yin Dong,Pu-Yu Li,San-Qiang Li,She-Gan Gao,Dao-Yin Dong","Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a new respiratory illness caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and now spreads globally. Currently, therapeutics and effective treatment options remain scarce and there is no proven drug to treat COVID-19. Targeting the positive-sense RNA genome and viral mRNAs of SARS-CoV-2 to simultaneously degrade viral genome templates for replication and viral mRNAs for essential gene expression would be a strategy to completely realize virus elimination. Type VI CRISPR enzymes Cas13 have recently been identified as programmable RNA-guided, RNA-targeting Cas proteins with nuclease activity that allows for RNA cleavage and degradation. The precise viral RNA detection and antiviral application of the CRISPR/Cas13 system depend on high-efficient and minimal off-target crRNAs. Although a computer-based algorithm has been applied for the design of crRNAs targeting SRAS-CoV-2, the experimental screening system to identify optimal crRNA is not available. We develop a one-step experimental screening system to identify high-efficient crRNAs with minimal off-target effects for CRISPR/Cas13-based SARS-CoV-2 elimination. This platform provides the foundation for CRISPR/Cas13-based diagnostics and therapeutics for COVID-19. This platform is versatile and could also be applied for crRNAs screening for other RNA viruses."

However, the comprehensive separation and characterization of Qingfei Paidu Decoction are of a great challenge due to the diversity of chemical components in a wide range of polarity. In this study, a triplex off-line two-dimensional liquid chromatography coupled with quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry is developed for the analysis of Qingfei Paidu Decoction. One reversed-phase liquid chromatography×hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography system and two reversed-phase liquid chromatography×reversed phase liquid chromatography systems were constructed to separate polar components and weak-polar components in Qingfei Paidu Decoction, respectively. Benefiting from the good orthogonality of two-dimensional liquid chromatography and high sensitivity of quadrupole time-of-flight MS, chemical components with different polarities and content were discovered. A total of 749 peaks were detected in positive and negative ionization mode and presented as a four-dimensional data plot. Meanwhile, 498 compounds belonging to 14 categories were tentatively identified. These results provide good supplementary to elucidate the material basis of Qingfei Paidu Decoction. The triplex off-line two-dimensional liquid chromatography-quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry strategy can be a powerful and efficient tool for the separation and characterization of chemical substances in traditional Chinese medicine formulas."
1584,Quantitative modelling of Ostracod bioassay: assigning toxicity index to potentially chemical contaminated swimming pools,"Arinze I Onwurah,Obinna A Oje,Victor Okpashi,Angela C Udebuani,Chidiebere E Ugwu,Ikechukwu N Onwurah,Arinze I Onwurah,Obinna A Oje,Victor Okpashi,Angela C Udebuani,Chidiebere E Ugwu,Ikechukwu N Onwurah","One of the primary objectives of any public health programme is to design a protocol that will curtail a population from being predisposed to toxic substances in the environment. Biomarkers help in actualising such an objective by their potential to detect the presence of toxic substances in environmental media such as soil, water and air. The Ostracod Heterocypris incongruens, an already established biomarker for quality evaluation of freshwater, does not quantify toxicity. This work was aimed at modelling Ostracod bioassay as a quantitative whole-water toxicity assay (QWTA) for the determination of potentially chemical contaminated swimming pools. In this modelling approach, a pool water sample was deliberately contaminated with a mixture of Fenton reagent (FR) and Bonny light (BL) crude oil. The mechanism of toxic injury of this mixture is via oxidative stress-mediated superoxide ion and other free radicals. The mortalities and growth factors of the exposed freshly hatched Ostracods to the serial dilutions of the contaminated swimming pool water sample for 6 days were mathematically modelled to toxicity indices (Ti), which were used to construct the toxicity reference curve (TRC). A graph of the ""toxic concentrations"" of the serially diluted contaminated pool water sample against Ostracod mortality was plotted. The TRC and the linear graph constitute the ""Ostracod-linked mathematical model"". Against the reference mortality ≤ 20% of the Ostracods, the toxicity index based on the model prediction is ≤ 32.5, and this signifies ""no observed toxic effect"" for toxicity values below 32.5 units. Using this model, toxicity indices were calculated for 5 randomly selected swimming pools in the study area. The results showed that the outdoor pool SP 5 has a toxic index of 49.0, while outdoor pools SP 2 and SP 3 each has a toxic index of 42.5. The indoor swimming pool (SP 4) and Standard water (control) have zero toxicity, thus suggesting that that the outdoor pools SP 2, SP 3 and SP 5 were possibly contaminated by chemicals from extraneous sources while contamination of SP 1 was very much negligible, hence the ""no observed toxic effect""."

Using as reference solid-state X-ray structures of enantiomeric and racemic forms of ketoprofen, a set of self-assembly models underpinned by density functional theory calculations has been considered for the analysis of spectroscopic data, infrared (IR) and vibrational circular dichroism (VCD), obtained for solutions of the samples as a function of composition and solvent. From our results it can be concluded that, contrary to the general belief for generic carboxylic acids, there are no cyclic dimeric structures of ketoprofen present in solution, but rather linear arrays made up of two (in high polar or diluted media) or more units (in low polar or low dilution media). This observation is in line with the idea that the weak contacts (other than H-bonding) would hold the key to molecular self-assembly, in agreement with recent studies on other aromatic carboxylic acids."

In the meanwhile, the contradiction between the supply and demand in China's natural gas market (NGM) has also been increasing gradually. Accordingly, the Chinese government has introduced a slew of policies to ease this contradiction. However, China's NGM is still facing many problems and challenges. The purpose of this study is to investigate the peak-shaving demand of the NGM in China, as well as to estimate the status and trend of underground gas storage (UGS) development for peak-shaving of the NGM. Firstly, the status and development direction of the NGM in China is discussed considering the supply and demand situation. The regional difference, the seasonal difference and the import impact are analyzed in detail to clarify the peak-shaving demand of national natural gas supply. Secondly, the status, direction, difficulties and challenges of UGS are discussed in depth. Finally, this study proposes some potential suggestions for the regulation of the NGM and the development of UGS in China."

In this study, we focused on the immunomodulatory properties of Latilactobacillus curvatus BYB3, formerly called Lactobacillus curvatus, isolated from kimchi. In a mouse model of 14-day dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis, treatment with L. curvatus BYB3 significantly decreased the disease activity index, colon length, and weight loss. Moreover, histological analyses showed that L. curvatus BYB3 protected the structural integrity of the intestinal epithelial layer and mucin-secreting goblet cells from DSS-induced damage, with only slight infiltration by immune cells. To evaluate the molecular mechanisms underlying L. curvatus BYB3-driven inhibition of interleukin 6 production, possible in vivo anti-inflammatory effects of L. curvatus BYB3 were examined in the same mouse model. In addition, significantly lower levels of IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 upregulation were seen in the DSS+BYB3 group (compared to that in the DSS group). These results indicate that L. curvatus BYB3 exhibits health-promoting effects via immune modulation; and therefore, it can be used to treat various inflammatory diseases."

It may cause serious ailments in infected individuals and complications may lead to death. X-rays and Computed Tomography (CT) scans can be used for the diagnosis of the disease. In this context, various methods have been proposed for the detection of COVID-19 from radiological images. In this work, we propose an end-to-end framework consisting of deep feature extraction followed by feature selection (FS) for the detection of COVID-19 from CT scan images. For feature extraction, we utilize three deep learning based Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). For FS, we use a meta-heuristic optimization algorithm, Harmony Search (HS), combined with a local search method, Adaptive β -Hill Climbing (A β HC) for better performance. We evaluate the proposed approach on the SARS-COV-2 CT-Scan Dataset consisting of 2482 CT scan images and an updated version of the previous dataset containing 2926 CT scan images. For comparison, we use a few state-of-the-art optimization algorithms. The best accuracy scores obtained by the present approach are 97.30% and 98.87% respectively on the said datasets, which are better than many of the algorithms used for comparison. The performances are also at par with some recent works which use the same datasets. The codes for the FS algorithms are available at: https://github.com/khalid0007/Metaheuristic-Algorithms."

Syam; Sintie, Yihun Tefera; Said, Zafar; Singh, Manoj K.; Punnaiah, V.; Sousa, Antonio C. M.","The energy and cost saving of flat plate collector using Al2O3/water nanofluids and with wire coil with core rod inserts were studied experimentally. The experiments were conducted for various particle loadings of nanofluid (0.1%, 0.2% and 0.3%) and nanofluid with various p/d values of wire coil with core-rod inserts (p/d = 1.79, 2.54 and 3.24). The potential increase of collector efficiency is converted into useful size reduction, weight reduction, cost, and energy saving of the collector. With the use of nanofluids in the collector its efficiency is enhanced. The maximum collector efficiency is 37.73% for particle loading of 0.3% in the collector at a flow rate of 300 lit/hr in validation with water collector. By providing wire coil with core-rod inserts, p/d value of 1.79 with 0.3% particle loading of nanofluid, the collector efficiency is further incremented to 64.15% at a flow rate of 300 lit/hr. Meanwhile, at the same experimental conditions, using 0.3% nanofluid, a maximum reduction in the collector area is 27.66%, and it is reduced to 39.33% for nanofluid of 0.3% with p/d of 1.79 insert. The original cost of the water collector is 223.88$, which is reduced to 161.94$ for 0.3% nanofluid and further reduced to 135.82$ for 0.3% nanofluid with p/d of 1.79 insert. Simultaneously, the embodied energy of materials used in the collector is reduced by using nanofluids and inserts in the collector. Besides, the heat transfer and friction factor are also evaluated, and the data is fitted."
1591,Environmental impacts of recycling crystalline silicon (c-SI) and cadmium telluride (CDTE) solar panels,"Maani, Thomas; Celik, Ilke; Heben, Michael J.; Ellingson, Randall J.; Apul, Defne","There has been a substantial growth in the deployment of solar photovoltaic (PV) panels in the past couple decades. Solar PVs have a life span of about 25 years and much of the deployed PVs will soon reach their end of life (EoL). It is now timely to plan for the EoL of PVs to recover valuable materials and recycle PV modules sustainably. The goal of this study was to analyze the environmental impacts of different recycling methods for crystalline silicon (c-Si) and CdTe panels. A life cycle assessment (LCA) was performed for delamination and material separation phases of recycling solar panels. The LCA results showed that the recycling of c-Si and CdTe PVs contribute 1325% and 34%, respectively to the entire PV lifecycle impacts. Also, for both c-Si and CdTe PVs, the thermal-based recycling methods resulted in lower environmental impacts than chemical and mechanical methods, except for pyrolysis. Nitric acid dissolution used for c-Si PV recycling had the highest impacts among all methods since the material consumption for this method has not been optimized for industrial use. Results from this study suggested that current techniques used in recycling of PVs, produce higher impacts than extraction of Al, Si and glass for c-Si and extraction of glass for CdTe. Lastly, this study identified which materials to prioritize for highest economic and environmentals benefits from recycling. These will be Ag, Al, Si, and glass in c-Si modules, and Te, Cu, and glass in CdTe modules."
1592,"Comparing performances, costs and energy balance of ex situ remediation processes for PAH-contaminated marine sediments","Bianco, Francesco; Monteverde, Gelsomino; Race, Marco; Papirio, Stefano; Esposito, Giovanni","This study proposes a comparison of different ex situ technologies aimed at the removal of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons from marine sediments in terms of performances, costs and energy balance. In accordance with the principles of water-energy nexus, anaerobic bioremediation, soil washing and thermal desorption were investigated under low liquid phase and temperature conditions using phenanthrene (PHE) as model compound. After 42 days of anaerobic bioremediation, the highest PHE biodegradation of 68 and 64% was observed under denitrifying and methanogenic conditions, respectively, accompanied by N-2 and CH4 production and volatile fatty acid accumulation. During soil washing, more than 97% of PHE was removed after 60 min using a solid-to-liquid ratio of 1:3. Along the same treatment time, low-temperature thermal desorption (LTTD) allowed a PHE removal of 88% at 200 degrees C. The economic analysis indicated that LTTD resulted in a higher cost (i.e. 1782 euro m(-3)) than bioremediation and soil washing (228 and 371 euro m(-3), respectively). The energy balance also suggested that bioremediation and soil washing are more sustainable technologies as a lower required energy (i.e. 16 and 14 kWh m(-3), respectively) than LTTD (i.e. 417 kWh m(-3)) is needed."
1593,Global Patterns in Marine Sediment Carbon Stocks,"Atwood, Trisha B.; Witt, Andrew; Mayorga, Juan; Hammill, Edd; Sala, Enric","To develop more accurate global carbon (C) budgets and to better inform management of human activities in the ocean, we need high-resolution estimates of marine C stocks. Here we quantify global marine sedimentary C stocks at a 1-km resolution, and find that marine sediments store similar to 3117 (3006-3209) Pg C in the top 1 m (more than twice that of terrestrial soils). Sediments in abyss/basin zones account for 75% of the global marine sediment C stock, and 52% of that stock is within the 200-mile Exclusive Economic Zones of countries. Currently, only similar to 2% of sediment C stocks are located in highly to fully protected areas that prevent the disturbance of the seafloor. Our results show that marine sediments represent a large and globally important C sink. However, the lack of protection for marine C stocks makes them highly vulnerable to human disturbances that can lead to their remineralization to CO2, further aggravating climate change impacts."
1594,A sustainable development framework for a cleaner multi-item multi-stage textile production system with a process improvement initiative,"Tayyab, Muhammad; Jemai, Jihed; Lim, Han; Sarkar, Biswajit","One of the most significant sectors in global economy is the textile industry, especially in asian continent. Owing to massive consumption of water in the wet processing operations of the textile sector, this industry is a major creator of effluent water. These effluents severely negatively affect plant photosynthetic function and must be treated prior to discharge into the environment. Reducing this type of hazardous environmental waste is one of the key considerations of lean philosophy. This enhances the consideration of the investments and expenditures made for waste water treatment in production decisions of the textile industry. Along with this, carbon emissions from production systems are more tightly regulated than in the past. Under emissions tax and allocated cap policies, manufacturing setups have to reduce their emissions by upgrading through technological changes and process improvements. In this context, this research provides a sustainable development framework for a cleaner textile production system (in the wet-processing category). The production model is analyzed with regard to environmental and effluent water treatment policies in the multi-stage production system, and optimal batch quantity is determined through a metaheuristic approach. Process reliability can be achieved by improving the production process, for which a discrete investment policy for setup cost reduction and process improvement is suggested, and benefits of these investments to improve environmental protection are studied through comparative analysis. Practical applicability of the proposed production model is highlighted through numerical experiment, sensitivity analysis, and important managerial insights. A trade-off among the investments in various aspects of the system is developed, and the results analysis verify that the introduction of discrete investments for process improvement reduces the effluent water quantity by 12.56% and variable CO2 emissions cost by 20.98% per batch, thus motivating economic growth and minimizing environmental impacts of the production system.

To evaluate the performance of the system, energy, exergy, and economic analyses were performed. Also, a parametric analysis was performed to assess the effects of various parameters on the system's performance criteria. The economic feasibility of the plant was analyzed in terms of net present value. For the base case, the performance metrics are evaluated as W.net=8.347 MW, epsilon=46.22%, SUCP=14.07 $/GJ, and m.fw=11.7 kg/s. Among all components of the system, the combustion chamber is the greatest contributor to the exergy destruction rate, at 3250 kW. It is shown with the parametric analysis that raising the combustion temperature leads to higher electricity and freshwater production capacity. For a fuel cost of 2 $/GJ and an electricity price of 0.07 $/kWh, the total net present value at the end of plant's lifespan is 6.547x106 $, and the payback period is 6.75 years. Thus, the plant is feasible from an economic perspective."

1597,Study of the Involvement of the P2Y12 Receptor in Chronic Itching in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus,"Xiumei Xu,Huiqing Zhang,Lin Li,Runan Yang,Guilin Li,Shuangmei Liu,Günther Schmalzing,Hong Nie,Shangdong Liang,Xiumei Xu,Huiqing Zhang,Lin Li,Runan Yang,Guilin Li,Shuangmei Liu,Günther Schmalzing,Hong Nie,Shangdong Liang","Itching is a common clinical symptom in diabetic patients. This research is to carry out experiments on the pathological changes in the P2Y12 receptor in type 2 diabetes mellitus complicated with chronic itching. Changes in body weight, fasting blood glucose (FBG), thermal hyperalgesia, cold hyperalgesia, spontaneous itching, and sciatic nerve conduction velocity were detected. The content of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the dorsal root ganglion was detected by chemical fluorescence. The expression of the P2Y12 receptor, NLRP3, ASC, interleukin-1β (IL-1β), and IL-18 was detected by Western blotting, real-time quantitative PCR, immunofluorescence double labelling, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Itching and pain behaviours of the mice in the type 2 diabetes mellitus + itch group were significantly increased, and the expression of P2Y12 and NLRP3 as well as the content of ROS increased, and these changes were significantly reversed by treatment with P2Y12 short hairpin RNA (shRNA) or P2Y12 antagonist ticagrelor. Upregulated P2Y12 receptor expression after the activation of satellite glial cells contributes to the increase in ROS content in vivo, followed by NLRP3 inflammasome activation, increased inflammatory cytokine release, and damage to peripheral nerves, which leads to chronic itching. Treatment with P2Y12 shRNA or ticagrelor can inhibit these pathological changes, thus improving itching behaviour. Development mechanism of diabetes mellitus complicated with chronic itching. Notes: The upregulation of P2Y12 receptor expression and the activation of SGCs lead to the increase of ROS content in vivo, followed by the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome, the increase of inflammatory cytokine release, the abnormal excitation of DRG neurons, and the damage of peripheral nerves, resulting in chronic itching. P2Y12 receptor-related inflammatory injury involves chronic itching in type 2 diabetes mellitus. Treatment with P2Y12 receptor shRNA or P2Y12 antagonist ticagrelor can inhibit these pathological changes and improve itching behaviour."

1599,Impacts of heavy metal pollution on the ionomes and transcriptomes of Western mosquitofish (Gambusia affinis),"John L Coffin,Joanna L Kelley,Punidan D Jeyasingh,Michael Tobler,John L Coffin,Joanna L Kelley,Punidan D Jeyasingh,Michael Tobler","Our understanding of the mechanisms mediating the resilience of organisms to environmental change remains lacking. Heavy metals negatively affect processes at all biological scales, yet organisms inhabiting contaminated environments must maintain homeostasis to survive. Tar Creek in Oklahoma, USA, contains high concentrations of heavy metals and an abundance of Western mosquitofish (Gambusia affinis), though several fish species persist at lower frequency. To test hypotheses about the mechanisms mediating the persistence and abundance of mosquitofish in Tar Creek, we integrated ionomic data from seven resident fish species and transcriptomic data from mosquitofish. We predicted that mosquitofish minimize uptake of heavy metals more than other Tar Creek fish inhabitants and induce transcriptional responses to detoxify metals that enter the body, allowing them to persist in Tar Creek at higher density than species that may lack these responses. Tar Creek populations of all seven fish species accumulated heavy metals, suggesting mosquitofish cannot block uptake more efficiently than other species. We found population-level gene expression changes between mosquitofish in Tar Creek and nearby unpolluted sites. Gene expression differences primarily occurred in the gill, where we found upregulation of genes involved with lowering transfer of metal ions from the blood into cells and mitigating free radicals. However, many differentially expressed genes were not in known metal response pathways, suggesting multifarious selective regimes and/or previously undocumented pathways could impact tolerance in mosquitofish. Our systems-level study identified well characterized and putatively new mechanisms that enable mosquitofish to inhabit heavy metal-contaminated environments."

These potentials could be separated in different classes, each with a specific and rather constant shape and amplitude. They were largest in spinal laminae III-V and gradually faded at deeper locations, without showing the polarity reversal displayed at these depths by the focal potentials produced by stimulation of muscle and cutaneous afferents. We propose that the dIFPs are postsynaptic field potentials generated by strongly coupled sets of dorsal horn neurons displaying a spatial orientation that generates closed field potentials in response to stimulation of high-threshold cutaneous and muscle afferents. These neuronal sets could form part of the spinal inhibitory circuitry that mediates presynaptic inhibition and Ib non-reciprocal postsynaptic inhibition and could be involved in the sensory-motor transformations activated by stimulation of high-threshold cutaneous afferents."
1602,Evaluation and governance of green development practice of port: A sea port case of China,"Hua, Chengying; Chen, Jihong; Wan, Zheng; Xu, Lang; Bai, Yun; Zheng, Tianxiao; Fei, Yijie","Port development is an important driver for global economic growth, and also a main energy user and polluter in the world. Amid the global energy crisis and environmental degradation, the international port community has proposed the concept of green port. Zhuhai Port, an important shipping and logistics platform in southern China, is confronted with key questions of how to effectively conduct environmental pollution control and green development performance evaluation, while its size and business performance continue the rapid growth. To address this problem, this study first suggested a green port indicator system tailored-made for Zhuhai Port, and then uses the fuzzy importance-performance analysis (FIPA) method to determine the performance of Zhuhai Port in green port indicators before putting forward a governance strategy. The study shows that Zhuhai Port should focus on monitoring of energy consumption and pollutant emissions, innovation of scientific research technologies and development of green port schemes to deepen the concept of green development and improve the energy conservation and environmental protection capacity of the port. The research results can serve as a theoretical basis for formulation of Zhuhai's green port policies and the establishment of an effective methodology system. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

UCNP were synthesized via the solvothermal method and had a range of diameters within 13 and 50 nm. Structural and photophysical changes were monitored for the UCNP samples after a 24-month incubation period in dry phase and further redispersion. Structural characterization was performed by means of X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) as well as dynamic light scattering (DLS), and the upconversion luminescence (UCL) studies were executed at various temperatures (from 4 to 295 K) using time-resolved and steady-state spectroscopy. An increase in the hexagonal lattice phase with the increase of Gd3+ content was found, although the cubic phase was prevalent in most samples. The Tm3+-luminescence intensity as well as the Tm3+-luminescence decay times peaked at the Gd3+ concentration of 30 mol%. Although the general upconverting luminescence properties of the nanoparticles were preserved, the 24-month incubation period lead to irreversible agglomeration of the UCNP and changes in luminescence band ratios and lifetimes."
1604,Relationship between inward FDI and environmental degradation for Pakistan: an exploration of pollution haven hypothesis through ARDL approach,"Nadeem, Abdul M.; Ali, Tariq; Khan, Muhammad T. L.; Guo, Zhengquan","In many developing countries, rising pollution and FDI inflows are positively correlated. This paper explores the existence of pollution haven hypothesis in Pakistan by employing the autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) bounds test on yearly data from 1971 to 2014 for foreign direct investment inflow and four pollutants, i.e., CO2 emissions, CO2 emissions from solid fuels, SO2 emissions, and GHG emissions. In each case, eight different models are tested by incorporating different explanatory variables with foreign direct investment inflow. The outcome of this study shows that in some of the models a positive long-term relationship exists between FDI inflow and CO2 emissions, CO2 emissions from solid fuels, and GHG emissions and a negative long-term relationship between FDI inflow and SO2 emissions. Overall, we found no conclusive evidence of the existence of the pollution haven hypothesis for Pakistan. As Pakistan is taking active measures to attract more FDI, it is essential to introduce appropriate environmental policies and institutional reforms that do not hinder FDI inflows."

ET partitioning can also support the description of atmosphere and land interactions and provide unique insights into vegetation water status. Previous studies have identified leaf area index (LAI) estimation as a key descriptor of biomass conditions needed for the estimation of transpiration and evaporation. LAI estimation in clumped vegetation systems, such as vineyards and orchards, has proven challenging and is strongly related to crop phenological status and canopy management. In this study, a feature extraction model based on previous research was built to generate a total of 202 preliminary variables at a 3.6-by-3.6-meter-grid scale based on submeter-resolution information from a small Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (sUAV) in four commercial vineyards across California. Using these variables, a machine learning model called eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) was successfully built for LAI estimation. The XGBoost built-in function requires only six variables relating to vegetation indices and temperature to produce high-accuracy LAI estimation for the vineyard. Using the six-variable XGBoost-based LAI map, two versions of the Two-Source Energy Balance (TSEB) model, TSEB-PT and TSEB-2T were used for energy balance and ET partitioning. Comparing these results with the Eddy-Covariance (EC) tower data, showed that TSEB-PT outperforms TSEB-2T on the estimation of sensible heat flux (within 13% relative error) and surface heat flux (within 34% relative error), while TSEB-2T outperforms TSEB-PT on the estimation of net radiation (within 14% relative error) and latent heat flux (within 2% relative error). For the mature vineyard (north block), TSEB-2T performs better than TSEB-PT in partitioning the canopy latent heat flux with 6.8% relative error and soil latent heat flux with 21.7% relative error; however, for the younger vineyard (south block), TSEB-PT performs better than TSEB-2T in partitioning the canopy latent heat flux with 11.7% relative error and soil latent heat flux with 39.3% relative error."
1606,"Integrated techno-economic modeling, flexibility analysis, and business case assessment of an urban virtual power plant with multi-market co-optimization","Wang, Han; Riaz, Shariq; Mancarella, Pierluigi","The concept of Virtual Power Plant (VPP) is recognized as an effective option to aggregate and operate Distributed Energy Resources (DER) to participate in wholesale energy markets and provide flexibility and associated grid services that are needed in a renewable-rich energy system. Also, as most of the DER are available in urban areas, there are increasing interests in assessing the potential to develop urban VPP, for example in university campuses. However, exploiting the flexibility of VPP and developing robust business cases require advanced considerations on their technical and commercial constraints and trade-offs in deploying the VPP's flexibility when simultaneously participating in multiple markets. In this context, this paper presents a comprehensive, integrated techno-economic modeling approach that assesses the technical and commercial flexibility opportunities and develops a relevant business case framework based on co-optimized participation in multiple markets for an urban VPP. A real-world case study based on the University of Melbourne's new campus under development is used to demonstrate the proposed approach, including the VPP's participation in the energy, frequency control ancillary services, demand response, and hedging contract markets. The technical analysis shows that diversity of DER portfolio results in improved participation of VPP in various markets. From an economic perspective, a multi-market co-optimization model such as the one proposed here, fully exploiting the DER's aggregated flexibility, results in attractive business cases for operating DER in urban areas as a VPP. The proposed approach and examples provided may be seen as a blueprint for more VPP applications and unlocking the great flexibility available in urban areas."

1608,A novel conformable fractional non-homogeneous grey model for forecasting carbon dioxide emissions of BRICS countries,"Wu, Wenqing; Ma, Xin; Zhang, Yuanyuan; Li, Wanpeng; Wang, Yong","Nowadays, climate change is one of the most important global issues to the international community. And nearly thirty kinds of greenhouse gases have been found in the atmosphere, of which the carbon dioxide plays a crucial role. In this paper, the carbon dioxide emissions of BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa) countries are investigated by using a conformable fractional non-homogeneous grey model. The grey model is systematically studied based on the new definitions of the conformable fractional accumulation and difference. The closed-form solutions of the new model are derived by applying mathematical tools and grey theory. And the meta-heuristic algorithm ant lion optimizer is adopted to search optimal fractional order. With raw data during the period from 2000 to 2018 announced by British Petroleum, the new model is established to forecast the carbon dioxide emissions of BRICS nations from 2019 to 2025. The results show that the trend of the carbon dioxide emissions of Brazil and India is growing year by year, the pattern of Russia is fluctuant but remains stable generally, while China and South Africa reach its peak value in 2019, and then decrease in the next several years. It also demonstrates that the governments of Brazil and India should take more measures to reduce carbon dioxide emissions, while the governments of China and South Africa should keep up their crucial work on carbon dioxide emissions.

This study proposes a Triple Exponential Smoothing prediction model to predict the supply of waste tires in 2019-2023, and the demand for these tires in three road construction scenarios. In addition, performance analysis is conducted to evaluate the carbon emissions produced in the production process of crumb rubber, modified asphalt, and styrene-butadiene-styrene modified asphalt. The reduction potential of carbon emissions when using crumb rubber for road construction is measured to contribute to the sustainable management of waste tires. The results demonstrate that the prediction model employed for prediction of waste tire production is robust, and the prediction results can be used to evaluate waste tire recycling. In addition, crumb rubber can be used as an efficient and environmentally friendly method for recycling end-of-life tires. Expanding the proportion of rubber powder asphalt application is an effective method for balancing the supply and demand contradiction of crumb rubber. Moreover, the potential for energy savings and emissions reduction, in addition to the economic benefits of using crumb rubber modified asphalt, are significantly higher than those employing styrene-butadiene-styrene modified asphalt. These results indicate the possibility of a circular economy and decreased dependence on non-renewable asphalt resources. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."

The current study was an exploratory examination of hookup motives, and positive and negative affect, related to the most recent hookup experience. Participants were 256 U.S. college students who reported hooking up in the last 12 months. Students completed a 30-min anonymous online survey assessing behaviors and cognitions during their most recent hookup, including alcohol use at the time of the hookup, motives for hooking up, and post-hookup affect. The model demonstrated that gender, conformity motives, and social-relationship motives significantly and positively predicted negative affect, whereas enhancement motives negatively predicted negative affect. Coping and enhancement motives significantly and positively predicted positive affect, whereas alcohol use negatively predicted positive affect. This study was a unique examination of hookup motives, with important findings that explained large portions of variance in post-hookup affect. The overall model explained approximately 23% of the variance in negative affect and 49% of the variance in positive affect. Findings highlight that, depending on the hookup motive, hooking up can be associated with positive outcomes, such as positive affect."
1611,Moving to economic growth without water demand growth - a decomposition analysis of decoupling from economic growth and water use in 31 provinces of China,"Wang, Qiang; Wang, Xiaowei","Increasing water consumption from various economic activities has posed increasing challenges for the sustainability of developing countries. In particular, China is facing a sharp conflict between rapid economic development and water shortage. Evaluating the decoupling state between economic growth and water consumption and exploring the driving factors behind this could serve to develop strategy to moving to economic growth without water use growth. To this end, this work uses the Tapio decoupling and LMDI decomposition methods to evaluate the decoupling performance between China's water consumption and economic growth at the national and provincial levels, and six driving factors are decomposed, namely water consumption intensity, industrial structure, economic development, water resource utilization rate, water resource endowment and population size. Results show that: (1) Only two decoupling states, strong decoupling and weak decoupling, occurred at national level, and the decoupling index shows a decreasing trend. (2) 31 provinces showed only two states of strong decoupling and weak decoupling. More than 60% of the provinces showed strong decoupling after 2011, and the decoupling effect was significantly better than that of 2004-2011. (3) The effects of water consumption intensity and industrial structure drive the occurrence of decoupling. Economic level and population size have a positive incremental effect on water consumption. Finally, we propose policy recommendations such as developing water-saving technologies and optimizing industrial structure to promote water sustainability. The comprehensive methodology in this paper provides a theoretical reference for research in other countries or other environmental issues. Governments in various regions can formulate effective measures to achieve sustainable use of water resources, responding to the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

The assessment methods of coastal water quality are multifarious, but many depend on either subjective judgment or objective calculation. We proposed a weighted sum methodology by integrating the subjective analytic hierarchy process and objective entropy theory (AHP-entropy weight methodology) to obtain an overall evaluation of coastal water quality. The mathematical models to transform the biochemical and physical parameter values and soluble substance concentrations into index scores have been formulated in comparison to the national water quality classification scheme. The application of the AHP-entropy weight methodology was demonstrated in the nearshore area of Yangjiang city, China, based on 23 seawater sampling stations in autumn 2017 and spring 2018. Datasets including biochemical and physical parameters, nutrients, and heavy metals have been converted into water quality index scores based on the proposed mathematical model. Results revealed that the overall water quality fell into the ""good"" class in both sampling seasons. The spatial distribution of the water quality index scores demonstrated that the relatively worse water quality occurred in estuarine and nearshore areas, signifying the negative effect of coastal anthropogenic activities. The statistical analyses like the hierarchical cluster analysis interpreted that the river input acted as a main source of pollutants in the study area. The AHP-entropy weight methodology could be a preferred way to assist decision-makers in properly evaluating the current state of coastal water quality in an unbiased, objective manner."

This study investigates the causal relationship between tourism, economic growth (GDP, capital investment), energy consumption, and environmental pollutants in developing economies, explicitly focusing on the case of Pakistan. Various econometric procedures and techniques were applied to test the proposed hypotheses. The findings suggest that economic growth support tourism development. Tourists' arrivals have a significant positive impact on energy consumption, capital investment, and CO2 emissions; besides, environmental pollutant (CO2) causes negative effects on tourism. The results suggest that a 1 unit increase in tourism increases CO2 emissions metric tons per capita by 0.26 units in the long-run. A 1 unit increase in capital investment increases CO2 emissions metric tons per capita by 0.21 units, and a 1 unit increase in energy consumption increases CO2 emissions metric tons per capita by 0.51 units in the long-run. In the short-run, a 1 unit increase in tourism, capital investment, and energy consumption rises CO2 emissions metric tons per capita by 0.045, 0.04, and 0.08 units, respectively. Sustainable tourism remains a sole option in developing economies to enhance the competitiveness of tourism as a tool for friendly developments. Thus, tourism policies are needed to be integrated with overall economic, environmental, and energy policies to encourage the shift towards sustainable tourism development to minimize environmental pollution."
1614,Shrinking ageing population and other drivers of energy consumption and CO2 emission in the residential sector: A case from Eastern Europe,"Balezentis, Tomas","Energy use and the resulting environmental impacts are interrelated with socioeconomic development of a certain region. What is more, the residential sector plays an important role as a major consumer of the energy. Thus, it is important to identify the underlying patterns of energy consumption and the resulting CO2 emission amidst the external shocks. This paper focuses on the case of residential energy consumption and CO2 emission in Lithuania over 2004-2016. This example is important given the context of shifts in the size and structure of population, economy and energy transformation in Lithuania that occurred over the period covered. The analysis relies on the index decomposition analysis and factorizes the changes in CO2 emission into the effects of population size, household size, dwelling area, energy intensity and carbon factor. The results indicate that decline in energy intensity and population played the most important role in pushing the CO2 emission down, yet these effects were offset by the changes in the lifestyle of the population (i.e. household size and dwelling area) along with increasing carbon factor. These findings are contrasted to the corresponding findings form the earlier studies around the world and the resulting policy implications are delivered."
1615,Multi-step ahead forecasting of regional air quality using spatial-temporal deep neural networks: A case study of Huaihai Economic Zone,"Zhang, Kefei; The, Jesse; Xie, Guangyuan; Yu, Hesheng","Air pollution has endangered both ecological environment and human health. Long-term prediction of air quality index (AQI) is an effective approach to early warning of, and prompt response to, pollution events to support cleaner industrial production. However, existing approaches to forecasting long-term air quality need further improvement. In this paper, we proposed a novel spatial-temporal deep learning algorithm based on bidirectional gated recurrent unit integrated with attention mechanism (BiAGRU), for more accurate air quality forecasting. The historical air quality measurements and meteorological monitoring data were constructed as a spatial-temporal matrix suitable for model input. The performance of the proposed BiAGRU model was evaluated by a series of metrics. The RMSE, MAE, R-2 and Fractional Bias (FB) values of the proposed BiAGRU model are 31.10, 23.06, 0.60, and 0.015, respectively, for 24 h multi-step ahead prediction assignments using Huaihai Economic Zone dataset. Quantitative comparison between models indicates the developed BiAGRU model outperformed various traditional machine learning algorithms and advanced deep neural network methods in term of lower error bias and higher accuracy and regression scores. This work is of importance to strengthen regional prevention and control of air pollution. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."
1616,Robust stochastic optimal dispatching method of multi-energy virtual power plant considering multiple uncertainties,"Kong, Xiangyu; Xiao, Jie; Liu, Dehong; Wu, Jianzhong; Wang, Chengshan; Shen, Yu","In recent years, with the rapid development of the energy Internet and the deepening of the complementary coupling of various energy sources, the concept of multi-energy virtual power plant comes into being. At the same time, insufficient research on optimal scheduling of multi-energy virtual power plants under multiple uncertainties. Here we propose a robust stochastic optimal dispatching method to solve the scheduling problem under multiple uncertainties. For the source side uncertainties, the uncertain set of cardinalities with a robust adjustable coefficient is adopted to describe the output of wind turbines and photovoltaics. For the load side uncertainties, the Wasserstein generative adversarial network with gradient penalty is used to generate electric, thermal, cooling, and natural gas load scenarios, and the K-medoids clustering is used to get typical scenes. A two-stage robust stochastic optimal model of the min-max-min structure was established. Based on the dual transformation theory and the column constraint generation algorithm, the original model was solved alternately. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed model and algorithm is verified by simulation analysis. The proposed method can get the scheduling scheme with the lowest operating cost in the worst scenario and is conducive to reducing the overall scheduling cost of the system."
1617,Hormone replacement therapy - Current recommendations,"Kugajeevan Vigneswaran,Haitham Hamoda,Kugajeevan Vigneswaran,Haitham Hamoda","Menopause is a major life event that can affect women in several ways. Its onset marks the end of the reproductive life cycle, and its impact can be both short and long term. Menopause is often a gradual process, preceded by a transitional period known as perimenopause. The average age of menopause in the UK is 51. The clinical manifestations of menopause result from the eventual exhaustion of oocytes within the ovaries. This leads to a chronic hypo-estrogenic state, which in the short term causes menopausal symptoms and over a long term, has an impact on bone and cardiovascular health. There has been a steep drop in the prescription of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) following the publication of the Women's Health Initiative Study and the Million Women Study. It is currently estimated that approximately a million women in the UK are taking HRT for control of their menopausal symptoms. This review summarises the current recommendations for HRT use in menopausal women. The benefits of HRT in improving the symptoms of menopause are discussed as well as the potential role of HRT in managing long-term sequelae is covered. Evidence pertaining to the potential risks associated with HRT is also be reviewed."
1618,Change Point Inference in the Presence of Missing Covariates for Principal Surrogate Evaluation in Vaccine Trials,"Tao Yang,Ying Huang,Youyi Fong,Tao Yang,Ying Huang,Youyi Fong","We consider the use of threshold-based regression models for evaluating immune response biomarkers as principal surrogate markers of a vaccine's protective effect. Threshold-based regression models, which allow the relationship between a clinical outcome and a covariate to change dramatically across a threshold value in the covariate, have been studied by various authors under fully observed data. Limited research, however, has examined these models in the presence of missing covariates, such as the counterfactual potential immune responses of a participant in the placebo arm of a standard vaccine trial had s/he been assigned to the vaccine arm instead. Based on a hinge model for a threshold effect of the principal surrogate on vaccine efficacy, we develop a regression methodology that consists of two components: (1) The estimated likelihood method is employed to handle missing potential outcomes, and (2) a penalty is imposed on the estimated likelihood to ensure satisfactory finite sample performance. We develop a method that allows joint estimation of all model parameters as well as a two-step method that separates the estimation of the threshold parameter from the rest of the parameters. Stable iterative algorithms are developed to implement the two methods and the asymptotic properties of the proposed estimators are established. In simulation studies, the proposed estimators are shown to have satisfactory finite sample performance. The proposed methods are applied to analyze a real dataset collected from dengue vaccine efficacy trials to predict how vaccine efficacy varies with an individual's potential immune response if receiving vaccine."
1619,The Marine Plastic Litter Issue: A Social-Economic Analysis,"Abalansa, Samuel; El Mahrad, Badr; Vondolia, Godwin Kofi; Icely, John; Newton, Alice","The issue of marine plastic litter pollution is multifaceted, cross-sectoral, and ongoing in the absence of appropriate management measures. This study analysed the issue of marine plastic litter pollution in the context of the Descriptor 10 of the Marine Strategy Framework Directive and Good Environmental Status of the oceans and seas. The Driver-Pressure-State-Impact-Response (DPSIR) framework was used to assess the causes, effects, and management measures to changes in the marine environment resulting from marine plastics pollution. We noted that less than 10 peer-reviewed publications have applied the Driver-Pressure-State-Impact-Response (DPSIR) model to the issue of marine plastics pollution. Some basic needs such as food security, movement of goods and services, and shelter are also some of the major drivers of marine plastic pollution. The use of plastics is linked to multiple economic sectors (fisheries, agriculture, transport, packaging, construction) and other human activities. A significant amount of the resulting pressures came from the economic sectors for packaging and construction. State changes occurred at the environmental (contamination and bioaccumulation), ecosystem (ingestion of plastics, ghost fishing) and ecosystem service levels (supply of sea food, salt and cultural benefits), with possible loss of jobs and income being some of the observed impacts on human welfare. Responses as management measures, which are tailored to meet each component of the DPSIR framework, were identified. These included policies, regulations, technological advancement and behavioural change. The research acknowledges the issue of marine plastics pollution as a global environmental problem and recommends a trans-disciplinary approach, involving all types of stakeholders. Future research and analysis applying the DPSIR framework will be useful to provide the information necessary for the effective, adaptive management of litter pollution by marine plastics."
1620,Targeted PET/MRI Imaging Super Probes: A Critical Review of Opportunities and Challenges,"Anna Kastelik-Hryniewiecka,Pawel Jewula,Karolina Bakalorz,Gabriela Kramer-Marek,Nikodem Kuźnik,Anna Kastelik-Hryniewiecka,Pawel Jewula,Karolina Bakalorz,Gabriela Kramer-Marek,Nikodem Kuźnik","Recently, the demand for hybrid PET/MRI imaging techniques has increased significantly, which has sparked the investigation into new ways to simultaneously track multiple molecular targets and improve the localization and expression of biochemical markers. Multimodal imaging probes have recently emerged as powerful tools for improving the detection sensitivity and accuracy-both important factors in disease diagnosis and treatment; however, only a limited number of bimodal probes have been investigated in preclinical models. Herein, we briefly describe the strengths and limitations of PET and MRI modalities and highlight the need for the development of multimodal molecularly-targeted agents. We have tried to thoroughly summarize data on bimodal probes available on PubMed. Emphasis was placed on their design, safety profiles, pharmacokinetics, and clearance properties. The challenges in PET/MR probe development using a number of illustrative examples are also discussed, along with future research directions for these novel conjugates."

A cloud on the horizon,"Anser, Muhammad Khalid; Yousaf, Zahid; Khan, Muhammad Azhar; Nassani, Abdelmohsen A.; Alotaibi, Saad M.; Abro, Muhammad Moinuddin Qazi; Xuan Vinh Vo; Zaman, Khalid","Coronavirus epidemic can push millions of people in poverty. The shortage of healthcare resources, lack of sanitation, and population compactness leads to an increase in communicable diseases, which may increase millions of people add in a vicious cycle of poverty. The study used the number of factors that affect poverty incidence in a panel of 76 countries for a period of 2010-2019. The dynamic panel GMM estimates show that the causes of death by communicable diseases, chemical-induced carbon and fossil fuel combustion, and lack of access to basic hand washing facilities menace to increase poverty headcounts, whereas, an increase in healthcare expenditures substantially decreases poverty headcounts across countries. Further, the results show the U-shaped relationship between economic growth and poverty headcounts, as economic growth first decreases and later increase poverty headcount due to rising healthcare disparities among nations. The causality estimates show that lack of access to basic amenities lead to increase of communicable diseases including COVID-19 whereas chemical-induced carbon and fossil fuel emissions continue to increase healthcare expenditures and economic growth in a panel of selected countries. The rising healthcare disparities, regional conflicts, and public debt burden further 'hold in the hand' of communicable diseases that push millions of people in the poverty trap."
1622,Levels and sources of hourly PM2.5-related elements during the control period of the COVID-19 pandemic at a rural site between Beijing and Tianjin,"Cui, Yang; Ji, Dongsheng; Maenhaut, Willy; Gao, Wenkang; Zhang, Renjian; Wang, Yuesi","To control the spread of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in China, many anthropogenic activities were reduced and even closed on the national scale. To study the impact of this reduction and closing down, hourly concentrations of PMis-related elements were measured at a rural site before (12-25 January 2020), during (26 January-9 February 2020) and after (22 March-2 April 2020) the control period when all people remained socially isolated in their homes and could not return to economic zones for work. Nine major sources were identified by the positive matrix factorization model, including fireworks burning, coal combustion, vehicle emissions, dust, Cr industry, oil combustion, Se industry, Zn smelter, and iron and steel industry. Before the control period, K, Fe, Ca, Zn, Ba and Cu were the main elements, and fireworks burning, Zn smelter and vehicle emissions provided the highest contributions to the total element mass with 55%, 12.1% and 10.3%, respectively. During the control period, K, Fe, Ba, Cu and Zn were the dominating elements, and fireworks burning and vehicle emissions contributed 55% and 27% of the total element mass. After the control period, Fe, K, Ca, Zn and Ba were the main elements, and dust and iron and steel industry were responsible for 56% and 21% of the total element mass. The increased contribution from vehicle emissions during the control period could be attributed to our sampling site being near a town hospital and the fact that the vehicle activities were not restricted. The source apportionment results were also related to air mass backward trajectories. The largest reductions of dust, coal combustion, and the industrial sources (Cr industry, Zn smelter, Se industry, iron and steel industry) were distinctly seen for northwest transport (Ulanqab) and were least significant for northeast transport (Tangshan and Tianjin).

1623,A spatial econometric empirical research on the impact of industrial agglomeration on haze pollution in China,"Zhao, Hong; Cao, Xiaoxi; Ma, Tao","Based on statistical data on 30 provincial administrative regions in China from 2000 to 2016, this paper conducts an empirical study of the impact of industrial agglomeration on haze pollution using the spatial Dubin model (SDM), spatial lag model (SLM), and spatial error model (SEM). The findings are as follows: (1) Industrial agglomeration can effectively reduce the degree of haze pollution. (2) Haze pollution has an inverted U-shaped relationship with economic development and population agglomeration. (3) The secondary industry has a positive correlation with haze pollution, while the tertiary industry can reduce haze pollution but not in an obvious manner. (4) The level of innovation and urbanization can help to reduce haze pollution, and the level of economic opening up and carbon dioxide emissions can exacerbate haze pollution. (5) Due to the insufficient commercialization of scientific and technological achievements, investment in science and technology is not obviously effective in preventing and controlling haze pollution. The relationship between environmental regulation and haze pollution is still unclear due to regional differences and the varied effectiveness of law enforcement. The study suggests that the government should guide industrial agglomeration in a reasonable manner, improve joint prevention and control across regions, and strengthen environmental regulation to prevent and control haze pollution."
1624,Evaluation of seismic performance factors for tension-only braced frames,"Shariati, Mahdi; Lagzian, Majid; Maleki, Shervin; Shariati, Ali; Nguyen Thoi Trung","The tension-only braced frames (TOBFs) are widely used as a lateral force resisting system (LFRS) in low-rise steel buildings due to their simplicity and economic advantage. However, the system has poor seismic energy dissipation capacity and pinched hysteresis behavior caused by early buckling of slender bracing members. The main concern in utilizing the TOBF system is the determination of appropriate performance factors for seismic design. A formalized approach to quantify the seismic performance factor (SPF) based on determining an acceptable margin of safety against collapse is introduced by FNMA P695. The methodology is applied in this paper to assess the SPFs of the TOBF systems. For this purpose, a trial value of the R factor was first employed to design and model a set of TOBF archetype structures. Afterwards, the level of safety against collapse provided by the assumed R factor was investigated by using the non-linear analysis procedure of FNMA P695 comprising incremental dynamic analysis (IDA) under a set of prescribed ground motions. It was found that the R factor of 3.0 is appropriate for safe design of TOBFs. Also, the system overstrength factor (Omega(0)) was estimated as 2.0 by performing non-linear static analyses."
1625,Do environmental conservation programs contribute to sustainable livelihoods? Evidence from China's grain-for-green program in northern Shaanxi province,"Dang, Xiaohu; Gao, Siwen; Tao, Rui; Liu, Guobin; Xia, Zidun; Fan, Liangxin; Bi, Wei","Several studies reported that conservation programs worldwide have profoundly reshaped participants' livelihoods and influenced other socio-economic processes. A fully understanding of how such conservation programs influence human lives is, therefore, crucial for their success. There, however, is little robust evidence of the effect of China's grain-for-green program (GGP), the largest conservation program in the world, on participants' livelihoods. That is, we do not know whether the program fulfills its goal of, at the very least, doing no harm to the lives of participants while simultaneously enhancing their environmental perception. To help fill this gap, we used a sustainable livelihood approach and structural equation modeling, based on household survey data from China's northern Shaanxi province, to compare the livelihood components of participants and non-participants in the GGP. We then characterized the interactions and pathways between their livelihood components and environmental perception. We found that the GGP indeed does no harm to participants' lives. Although participants suffer from a small reduction in natural capital due to a sharp decrease in their landholdings, they have much more off-farm income, subsidies, and financial and social assets than non-participants. Respondents commonly held positive attitudes toward the program's environmental benefits, but they had weak perceptions of the social and direct economic benefits of the GGP. Respondents' environmental perceptions of the GGP were significantly influenced by the number of available laborers, their education and health levels, off-farm income, subsidies, and the accessibility of transportation. Therefore, further resources should be dedicated to improving education as well as rural health care and infrastructure in order to create more off-farm job opportunities for GGP participants. In addition, decision makers should carefully redesign supporting policies, such as payments for ecosystem services, to help poor participants rebuild their livelihoods. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

1626,"The InVEST Habitat Quality Model Associated with Land Use/Cover Changes: A Qualitative Case Study of the Winike Watershed in the Omo-Gibe Basin, Southwest Ethiopia","Aneseyee, Abreham Berta; Noszczyk, Tomasz; Soromessa, Teshome; Elias, Eyasu","The contribution of biodiversity to the global economy, human survival, and welfare has been increasing significantly, but the anthropogenic pressure as a threat to the pristine habitat has followed. This study aims to identify habitat suitability, analyze the change in habitat quality from 1988 to 2018, and to investigate the correlation between impact factors and habitat quality. The InVEST habitat quality model was used to analyze the spatiotemporal change in habitat quality in individual land-use types in the Winike watershed. Remote sensing data were used to analyze the land use/land cover changes. Nine threat sources, their maximum distance of impact, mode of decay, and sensitivity to threats were also estimated for each land-use cover type. The analysis illustrates that habitat degradation in the watershed was continuously increasing over the last three decades (1988 to 2018). Each threat impact factor and habitat sensitivity have increased for the last 30 years. The most contributing factor of habitat degradation was the 25.41% agricultural expansion in 2018. Population density, land-use intensity, elevation, and slope were significantly correlated with the distribution of habitat quality. Habitat quality degradation in the watershed during the past three decades suggested that the conservation strategies applied in the watershed ecosystem were not effective. Therefore, this study helps decision makers, particularly regarding the lack of data on biodiversity. It further looks into the conflict between economic development and conservation of biodiversity."
1627,Influence of hybrid SiO2 and CeO2 nanoparticles on diesel engine emission operated with distilled tire oil blend,"Ramesh Chinnappan,Mohanraj Chandran,Rajvikram Madurai Elavarasan,Parthipan Nadarajan,Ramesh Chinnappan,Mohanraj Chandran,Rajvikram Madurai Elavarasan,Parthipan Nadarajan","The objective of this research is to reduce the emission and improve the performance of diesel engine when they operate with distilled tire pyrolysis oil blends (DTPO30). Utilization of tire oil on diesel engine has been an active research field for the last two decades. But, it is still challengeable due to their high emissions. To overcome this, the present study has been attempted to analyze the influence of hybrid silicon oxide (SiO2) and cerium oxide (CeO2) nanoparticles in tire oil blends. The SiO2 and CeO2 are considered in hybrid nature with proportions of 20 mg/L (sum 40 mg/L), 50 mg/L, and 70 mg/L each. The nanoparticles mixed fuel blends were prepared using an ultrasonication technique. The experiments were conducted with a water-cooled engine with a constant speed of 1500 rpm, a compression ratio of 17.5, and an injection timing of 23° BTDC. The FTIR spectra indicated that all the samples were identified with alkanes and alkenes like diesel. But, DTPO30 + 70 found with many peaks in bending mode, which indicates the changes in chemical functional groups. From the engine testing, the brake thermal efficiency was improved by about 2% and brake specific fuel consumption was reduced up to 0.03 kg/kW h with DTPO30 + 70 (SiO2 + CeO2) than DTPO30. The cylinder pressure and heat release rate were reduced with hybrid nanoparticles blended fuel than with that of individually mixed fuel. Also, the emissions such as NOx, CO, UBHC, and soot were reduced with hybrid nanoparticles, up to 4.8%, 13.5%, 27%, and 10% respectively. The hybrid nature of SiO2 + CeO2 has the potential to adhere to the soot particles around their surface which leads to reducing the duration of suspension in the atmosphere."
1628,A hybrid intelligent system for designing optimal proportions of recycled aggregate concrete,"Zhang, Junfei; Huang, Yimiao; Aslani, Farhad; Ma, Guowei; Nener, Brett","The replacement of natural coarse aggregate (NCA) with recycled coarse aggregate (RCA) in concrete mixtures offers various advantages, including conservation of natural resources, reduction of CO2 emissions, and cost reduction. However, multiple related variables and objectives (e.g., mechanical, economic, and environmental objectives) need to be considered when optimizing mixtures of recycled aggregate concrete (RAC). This cannot be achieved through traditional laboratory- or statistics-based methods. This study proposes a hybrid intelligent system based on artificial intelligence (AI) and metaheuristic algorithms for designing optimal mixtures of RAC. To verify the proposed model, a data set containing 344 different RAC mixtures was collected from previous literature. A semi-supervised cotraining algorithm using two k-nearest neighbor (kNN) regressors with different distance metrics is developed to label the unlabeled data in the collected dataset. Different AI models are incorporated into the system for modeling the relationship between RAC strength and its influencing variables. A multi-objective optimization (MOO) model based on AI algorithms and on a multi-objective firefly algorithm is used to search for optimal mixtures of RAC. The results show that kNN-based semi-supervised cotraining can effectively exploit unlabeled data to improve the regression estimates. In the test set, A Random Forest and Backpropagation Neural Network achieve the best prediction accuracy for predicting, respectively, uniaxial compressive strength and splitting tensile strength of RAC, indicated by the highest correlation coefficients (0.9064 and 0.8387, respectively) and lowest root-mean-square errors (6.639 MPa and 0.5119 MPa, respectively). The Pareto fronts of the multi-objective mixture optimization problem are successfully obtained by the MOO model. The proposed system can also be used to optimize mixture proportions of other cementitious materials in civil engineering. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."
1629,Implications of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARY) with the intersection of organophosphate flame retardants and diet-induced obesity in adult mice,"Gwyndolin M Vail,Sabrina N Walley,Ali Yasrebi,Angela Maeng,Thomas J Degroat,Kristie M Conde,Troy A Roepke,Gwyndolin M Vail,Sabrina N Walley,Ali Yasrebi,Angela Maeng,Thomas J Degroat,Kristie M Conde,Troy A Roepke","Previously, organophosphate flame retardants (OPFRs) were demonstrated to dysregulate homeostatic parameters of energy regulation within an adult mouse model of diet-induced obesity. Using the same OPFR mixture consisting of 1 mg/kg/day of each triphenyl phosphate, tricresyl phosphate, and tris(1,3-dichloro-2-propyl)phosphate, the current study examined the role of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) in OPFR-induced disruption by utilizing mice with brain-specific deletion of PPARγ (PPARγKO) fed either a low-fat diet (LFD) or high-fat diet (HFD). Body weight and composition, feeding behavior, glucose and insulin tolerance, circulating peptide hormones, and expression of hypothalamic genes associated with energy homeostasis were recorded. When fed HFD, the effects of OPFR on body weight and feeding behavior observed in the previous wild-type (WT) study were absent in mice lacking neuronal PPARγ. This posits PPARγ as an important target for eliciting OPFR disruption in a diet-induced obesity model. Interestingly, female PPARγKO mice, but not males, experienced many novel OPFR effects not noted in WT mice, including decreased fat mass, altered feeding behavior and efficiency, improved insulin sensitivity, elevated plasma ghrelin and hypothalamic expression of its receptor. Taken together, these data suggest both direct roles for PPARγ in OPFR disruption of obese mice and indirect sensitization of pathways alternative to PPARγ when neuronal expression is deleted."

A statistical model relying on four potential biomarkers intensity could be defined to predict the status of the samples. With a routine application perspective, the monitoring of the highlighted potential biomarkers was first transferred into high-throughput liquid chromatography-selected reaction monitoring (LC-SRM). The model's performances and robustness of the approach were preserved and providing a first demonstration of metabolomics-based biomarkers integration within a targeted workflow using common benchtop MS instrumentation. In addition, with a view to the widespread implementation of such biomarker-based tools, we have transferred the method to a second laboratory with similar instrumentation. This proof of concept allows the development and application of biomarker-based strategies to meet current doping control needs."
1631,Development of spectral-phenological features for deep learning to understand Spartina alterniflora invasion,"Tian, Jinyan; Wang, Le; Yin, Dameng; Li, Xiaojuan; Diao, Chunyuan; Gong, Huili; Shi, Chen; Menenti, Massimo; Ge, Yong; Nie, Sheng; Ou, Yang; Song, Xiaonan; Liu, Xiaomeng","Invasive Spartina alterniflora (S. alterniflora), a native riparian species in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, has led to serious degradation to the ecosystem and biodiversity as well as economic losses since it was introduced to China in 1979. Although multi-temporal remote sensing offers unique capability to monitor S. alterniflora over large areas and long time periods, three major hurdle exist: (1) in the coastal zone where S. alterniflora occupies, frequent cloud coverage reduces the number of available images that can be used; (2) prominent spectral variations exist within the S. alterniflora due to phonological variations; (3) poor spectral separability between S. alterniflora and its co-dominant native species is often presented in the territories where S. alterniflora intruded in. To articulate these questions, we proposed a new pixel-based phenological feature composite method (PpfCM) based on Google Earth Engine. The Ppf-CM method was brainstormed to battle the aforementioned three hurdles as the basic unit for extracting phonological feature is individual pixel in lieu of an entire image scene. With the Ppf-CM-derived phenological feature as inputs, we took a step further to investigate the performance of the latest deep learning method as opposed to that of the conventional support vector machine (SVM); Lastly, we strive to understand how S. alterniflora has changed its spatial distribution in the Beibu Gulf of China from 1995 to 2017. As a result, we found (1) the developed Ppf-CM method can mitigate the phonological variation and augment the spectral separability between S. alterniflora and the background species regardless of the significant cloud coverage in the study area; (2) deep learning, compared to SVM, presented better potentials for incorporating the new phenological features generated from the Ppf-CM method; and (3) for the first time, we discovered a S. alterniflora invasion outbreak occurred during 1996-2001."

Since its emergence in mid-2012, 2578 laboratory-confirmed cases in 27 countries have been reported by the World Health Organization, leading to 888 known deaths due to the disease and related complications. Dromedary camels are considered the major reservoir host for this virus leading to zoonotic infection in humans. Dromedary camels, llamas, and alpacas are susceptible to MERS-CoV, developing a mild-to-moderate upper respiratory tract infection characterized by epithelial hyperplasia as well as infiltration of neutrophils, lymphocytes, and some macrophages within epithelium, lamina propria, in association with abundant viral antigen. The very mild lesions in the lower respiratory tract of these camelids correlate with absence of overt illness following MERS-CoV infection. Unfortunately, there is no approved antiviral treatment or vaccine for MERS-CoV infection in humans. Thus, there is an urgent need to develop intervention strategies in camelids, such as vaccination, to minimize virus spillover to humans. Therefore, the development of camelid models of MERS-CoV infection is key not only to assess vaccine prototypes but also to understand the biologic mechanisms by which the infection can be naturally controlled in these reservoir species. This review summarizes information on virus-induced pathological changes, pathogenesis, viral epidemiology, and control strategies in camelids, as the intermediate hosts and primary source of MERS-CoV infection in humans."
1633,Surgical Techniques for Thoracolumbar Spine Fractures: WFNS Spine Committee Recommendations,"Salman Sharif,Yousuf Shaikh,Onur Yaman,Mehmet Zileli,Salman Sharif,Yousuf Shaikh,Onur Yaman,Mehmet Zileli","To formulate the specific guidelines for the recommendation of thoracolumbar fracture regarding surgical techniques and nonfusion surgery. WFNS (World Federation of Neurosurgical Societies) Spine Committee organized 2 consensus meeting. For nonfusion surgery and thoracolumbar fracture, a systematic literature search in PubMed and Google Scholar database was done from 2010 to 2020. The search was further refined by excluding the articles which were duplicate, not in English or were based on animal or cadaveric subjects. After thorough shortlisting, only 50 articles were selected for full review in this consensus meeting. To generate a consensus, the levels of agreement or disagreement on each item were voted independently in a blind fashion through a Likert-type scale from 1 to 5. The consensus was achieved when the sum for disagreement or agreement was ≥ 66%. Each consensus point was clearly defined with evidence strength, recommendation grade, and consensus level provided. A magnitude of prospective papers were analyzed to formulate consensus on various surgical techniques that can be employed to address different types of thoracolumbar fractures. Surgical treatment of thoracolumbar fractures can be a better option over the nonoperative approach, especially for those who cannot tolerate months in an orthosis or cast, such as those with multiple extremity injuries, skin lesions, obesity, and so forth. It generally allows early mobilization, less hospital stay, reduced pulmonary complications, and better correction of sagittal balance. Current available literature fails to demonstrate any statistically significant benefit of fusion surgery over nonfusion in thoracolumbar fractures."
1634,The relationship between biomass energy consumption and human development: Empirical evidence from BRICS countries,"Wang, Zhaohua; Bui, Quocviet; Zhang, Bin","The impact of biomass energy utilization is still a controversial issue, and there is no consensus among researchers. Previous researches paid attention to the effects of biomass energy consumption on economic growth and environmental. While most studies indicate that the usage of biomass energy enhances economic growth and contributes to environmental protection, some studies show the opposite result. Our research wishes to contribute to the existing literature by discovering the effect of biomass energy consumption on human development in BRICS countries in the period 1990-2015. Using econometric methods which can solve the problem of cross-sectional dependence and heterogeneity of slope such as LIPS and CADF unit root tests, LM bootstrap panel cointegration test, Continuously-Updated Fully-Modified (CUP-FM) and Continuously-Updated Bias-Corrected (CUP-BC) estimators, and Dumitrescu-Hurlin panel causality test, our results reveal that biomass energy usage increase human development in BRICS countries and bidirectional causality exists between these two variables. These results may be a suggestion for policymakers to promote the usage of biomass energy. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."

However, epidemiological and laboratory evidences indicate that these antibodies have a reduced neutralization ability against VoCs. We studied binding and neutralizing antibodies against the Spike protein domains and subunits of the Wuhan-Hu-1 virus and its alpha, beta, delta VoCs and of seasonal betacoronaviruses (HKU1 and OC43) in a cohort of 31 health care workers prospectively followed post-vaccination with BNT162b2-Comirnaty. The study of sequential samples collected up to 64 days post-vaccination showed that serological assays measuring IgG against Wuhan-Hu-1 antigens were a poor proxy for VoC neutralization. In addition, in subjects who had asymptomatic or mild COVID-19 prior to vaccination, the loss of nAbs following disease could be rapid and accompanied by post-vaccination antibody levels similar to those of naïve vaccinees.

Evidence from belt and road countries,"Ahmad, Mahmood; Jiang, Ping; Majeed, Abdul; Raza, Muhammad Yousaf","This study examines the effect of financial development (FD) and foreign direct investment (FDI) on the environmental quality for the panel of 90 belt and road countries from 1990 to 2017. This study advances the knowledge of financial development by using the new comprehensive index, which is based on access, depth, and efficiency of financial markets and financial institutions and incorporated foreign direct investment as an important determinant of environmental quality. By applying the Driscoll-Kraay standard error pooled ordinary least square method, the empirical findings reveal that FD deteriorates the environmental quality by increasing the CO2 emissions, while FDI improves environmental quality and the relationship between economic growth (EG) and CO2 emissions is inverted U-shaped, i.e., presence of EKC hypothesis. The energy consumption and urbanization pollute the environment, while trade openness enhances the quality of the environment. Furthermore, the Dumitrescu-Hurlin (DH) panel causality test result confirms that the bidirectional causality exists among FD, trade openness, energy consumption, and urbanization with CO2 emissions. The empirical results provide new insights for policymakers and also have several implications for the betterment of environmental quality."
1637,Large-scale production and transport of hydrogen from Norway to Europe and Japan: Value chain analysis and comparison of liquid hydrogen and ammonia as energy carriers,"Ishimoto, Yuki; Voldsund, Mari; Neksa, Petter; Roussanaly, Simon; Berstad, David; Gardarsdottir, Stefania Osk","Low-carbon hydrogen is considered as one of the key measures to decarbonise continental Europe and Japan. Northern Norway has abundant renewable energy and natural gas resources which can be converted to low-carbon hydrogen. However, Norway is located relatively far away from these markets and finding efficient ways to transport this hydrogen to the end-user is critical. In this study, liquefied hydrogen (LH2) and ammonia (NH3), as H-2-based energy carriers, are analysed and compared with respect to energy efficiency, CO2 footprint and cost. It is shown that the LH2 chain is more energy efficient and has a smaller CO2 footprint (20 and 23 kg-CO2/MWh(th) for Europe and Japan, respectively) than the NH3 chain (76 and 122 kg-CO2/MWh(thY)). Furthermore, the study finds the levelized cost of hydrogen delivered to Rotterdam to be lower for LH2 (5.0 EUR/kg-H-2) compared to NH3 (5.9 EUR/kg-H-2), while the hydrogen costs of the two chains for transport to Japan are in a similar range (about 7 EUR/kg-H-2). It is also shown that under optimistic assumptions, the costs associated with the LH2 chain (3.2 EUR/kg-H-2) are close to meeting the 2030 hydrogen cost target of Japan (2.5 EUR/kg-H-2).

1638,Enhancing waste to hydrogen production through biomass feedstock blending: A techno-economic-environmental evaluation,"AlNouss, Ahmed; McKay, Gordon; Al-Ansari, Tareq","Concerns related to global warming and the depletion of fossil fuels have propelled the global community to explore alternative renewable energy sources. Biomass is a nonconventional and renewable energy resource that can potentially be utilised for the production of sustainable heat and power. The thermal gasification process is an effective biomass conversion and utilisation method producing syngas as the product gas. This study details a biomass gasification process and subsequent optimisation, considering multiple parameters, including the type of feedstock and gasifying agent (gasifier) to maximise hydrogen production. Aspen Plus software is used to develop three agent-based biomass gasification models considering the characteristics of certain materials from Qatar built environment. The ultimate goal of the study is to optimise the gasification processes to yield different biomass blending options satisfying the maximisation of hydrogen generation through different scenarios. The capabilities of the built-in activated analysis package using Aspen Energy Analyser and Aspen Process Economic Analyser are utilised to evaluate the environmental and economic perspectives. The results demonstrate the excellence of steam-only biomass gasification in providing profitable and cleaner products. The yield of hydrogen production from blending of biomass feedstock achieved a high fraction of 5.23% with the steam-only gasification, while the yield increased from 1.63% to 5.22% for the oxygen/steam gasification when maximising the hydrogen fraction. Moreover, the selective limiting of biomass capacity enhances the quality of syngas through enriching the hydrogen production and lowers the need for subsequent adjustment and the manipulation of gasifying agent quantity and operating energy."
1639,Positive and negative social contacts with immigrants from different groups: Investigating the role of group appraisal and opportunity for contact using network analysis,"Eugene Tartakovsky,Sophie D Walsh,Eugene Tartakovsky,Sophie D Walsh","What can enhance positive inter-group contacts in a world of mass immigration is a subject high on the theoretical and practical agenda. However, there is a lack of research examining how contacts with different immigrant groups are related to characteristics of the group, as perceived by the receiving society. Using Threat-Benefit Theory (Tartakovsky & Walsh, 2016a, 2016b, 2019, 2020), the present study examines how different domains of positive and negative appraisal of a specific immigrant group may relate to contacts with group members. Using a representative sample of 1600 adults in the majority of the Jewish population in Israel, we applied network analysis to examine relationships between threat-benefit appraisal, opportunities for contact and levels of positive and negative contacts with four immigrant groups: diaspora immigrants from Ethiopia, Western countries and the former Soviet Union and asylum seekers. Levels of contact were related to particular domains of appraisal, which differed across immigrant groups. However, opportunities for contact had a stronger association with contact than the appraisal. Results point to a theoretical need to develop nuanced models related to inter-group contact, which consider particular characteristics of the immigrant group as perceived by the local population."

From prior reports and our own, we conclude Sankeys are an excellent tool for visualizing the changing status of older patients with cancer. Older adult symptom data is used as an example with data dispalyed in a range of Sankey flow diagrams. Because there is large heterogeneity in aging, different subgroups can be examined. In a single diagram, Sankey can show both the likelihood and variability of patients' future status from their current status."
1641,"Novel biosynthesis, characterization and bio-catalytic potential of green algae ( Spirogyra hyalina) mediated silver nanomaterials","Abdullah,Najlaa S Al-Radadi,Tahir Hussain,Shah Faisal,Syed Ali Raza Shah,Abdullah,Najlaa S Al-Radadi,Tahir Hussain,Shah Faisal,Syed Ali Raza Shah","In recent years green nanotechnology gained significant importance to synthesize nanoparticles due to their cost effectiveness and biosafety. In the current study, silver nanoparticles were synthesized by using extract of Spirogyra hyalina as a capping and reducing agent. The synthesized nanoparticles were characterized by UV-Visible spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, Scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, and X-ray diffractive analysis. Silver nanoparticles give a characteristic Surface Plasmon Resonance peak of 451 nm at 2.21 a.u (arbitrary unit). SEM micrograph revealed the spherical morphology and average grain size of 52.7 nm. Furthermore, antibacterial, antifungal, insecticidal, antioxidant and membrane damage activities were determined. The maximum antibacterial and antifungal activity was observed for Pseudomonas aeruginosa (18 ± 1.2 mm) and Fusarium solani (14.3 ± 0.6 mm), respectively. In membrane damage assay, Pseudomonas aeruginosa absorbed A260 wavelength and gave maximum peak values of 0.286, 0.434 and 0.629 at 25, 35 and 45 µg/mL of silver nanoparticles. The membrane damage assay confirmed that nanoparticles are involved in bacterial cell membrane damage. At 500 ppm silver nanoparticles showed 30% mortality against Tribolium castaneum (a common grain pest). The silver nanoparticles also showed potent antioxidant activity and successfully scavenged the DPPH free radicals upto 53.43 ± 0.17, 43.26 ± 0.97, 31.39 ± 0.33, 24.62 ± 0.85, and 14.13 ± 0.12% at a concentration of 400, 200, 100, 50, and 25 µg/mL of nanoparticles, respectively. It is concluded that silver nanoparticles can easily be synthesized by using green algae Spirogyra hyalina as a capping and reducing agent. Silver nanoparticles showed potent biomedical activities and thus can be used for therapeutic applications invitro and invivo."
1642,Analysis of Compound Climate Extremes and Exposed Population in Africa Under Two Different Emission Scenarios,"Weber, T.; Bowyer, P.; Rechid, D.; Pfeifer, S.; Raffaele, F.; Remedio, A. R.; Teichmann, C.; Jacob, D.","It is well established that Africa is particularly exposed to climate extremes including heat waves, droughts, and intense rainfall events. How exposed Africa is to the co-occurrence of these events is however virtually unknown. This study provides the first analysis of projected changes in the co-occurrence of five such compound climate extremes in Africa, under a low (RCP2.6) and high (RCP8.5) emissions scenario. These changes are combined with population projections for a low (SSP1) and high (SSP3) population growth scenario, in order to provide estimates of the number of people that may be exposed to such events at the end of the 21st century. We make use of an ensemble of regional climate projections from the Coordinated Output for Regional Evaluations (CORE) project embedded in the Coordinated Regional Climate Downscaling Experiment (CORDEX) framework. This ensemble comprises five different Earth System Model/Regional Climate Model (ESM/RCM) combinations with three different ESMs and two RCMs. We show that all five compound climate extremes will increase in frequency, with changes being greater under RCP8.5 than RCP2.6. Moreover, populations exposed to these changes are greater under RCP8.5/SSP3, than RCP2.6/SSP1, increasing by 47- and 12-fold, respectively, compared to the present-day. Regions of Africa that are particularly exposed are West Africa, Central-East Africa, and Northeast and Southeast Africa. Increased exposure is mainly driven by the interaction between climate and population growth, and the effect of population alone. This has important policy implications in relation to climate mitigation and adaptation. Plain Language Summary It is well known that Africa is exposed to a range of different climate hazards including droughts, heat waves, and extreme rainfall events, which cause major social and economic suffering. It is, however, largely unknown how exposed the African population is to the co-occurrence of such climate hazards. This is important because compound events will likely increase the suffering far and above that caused by individual climate hazards. In this study, we provide an analysis of potential changes in five different compound events, and the exposure of the African population to them, at the end of this century. Combining exposure to all compound events, the results show that compared to the present-day, the exposure of the African population may increase by 12- and 47-fold in the best- and worst-case scenarios, respectively. The spatial distribution of changes shows that West Africa and central and eastern regions of Africa may be particularly exposed. Increased exposure is mainly caused by the interaction between climate and population growth, and the effect of population alone. These results imply that any policy response designed to reduce exposure needs to address both climatic and socioeconomic factors. Key Points Five compound climate extremes are projected to be more frequent in Africa under both emission scenarios by the end of the century Populations in West Africa, Central-East Africa, and Northeast and Southeast Africa are projected to be particularly exposed Increased exposure is mainly driven by the interaction between climate and population growth, and the effect of population alone"
1643,Energy and economic analysis of a variable-geometry ejector in solar cooling systems for residential buildings,"Tashtoush, Bourhan; Nayfeh, Yousof","In the present, study two 1-D ejector mathematical models are used to predict the performance of a solar ejector cooling system with fixed and variable geometry ejectors. Thes models are implemented using MATLAB and EES Software. The effect of the mixing efficiencies on the performance of the system was investigated, and two empirical correlations were obtained using experimental data for an ejector cooling cycle with R141b as a refrigerant. The results obtained with varying efficiencies were found to be significantly more accurate than those obtained with previous models, which assumed a constant efficiency. The results showed that the ejector with fixed-geometry was very sensitive to the variations of the operational conditions and could practically be functional only under specific conditions. It was also found that the solar ejector cooling system with a variable area ejector has higher coefficient of performance under a vast range of operational conditions. The new system could be easily implemented in residential building air conditioning systems with solar energy as the driving source of heat. The refrigerant R134a was found to give the best performance considering operational, safety, and environmental factors. The economic analysis revealed that the new system is profoundly better than the conventional systems in terms of payback period and net present value."
1644,SARS-CoV-2 might transmit through the skin while the skin barrier function could be the mediator,"Qiannan Xu,Li Zhang,Lihong Chen,Xiaoqing Zhao,Xiaopan Wang,Mengyan Hu,Yunchen Le,Feng Xue,Xia Li,Jie Zheng,Qiannan Xu,Li Zhang,Lihong Chen,Xiaoqing Zhao,Xiaopan Wang,Mengyan Hu,Yunchen Le,Feng Xue,Xia Li,Jie Zheng","During the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, it were reported that COVID-19 patients could have cutaneous symptoms, and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was observed on the skin of COVID-19 patients, which indicated that the skin is one target of SARS-CoV-2. Meanwhile, reports about SARS-CoV-2 transmission through food cold-chain overpacks emerged. With the fact that SARS-CoV-2 could survive on the skin for more than 9 h, the skin could be implicated in SARS CoV-2 transmission. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a critical membrane protein for SARS-CoV-2 that enters a host cell, was recognized to be associated with the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Therefore, tissues that express ACE2 might have the potential to be infected by and transmit SARS-CoV-2. The skin is one such tissue that expresses ACE2. However, unlike the lung that expresses ACE2 on the upper-most epithelial layer, the skin is composed of different layers of cells that function as a barrier, and cells under the top epidermal layer express ACE2. Since the skin barrier is the first line of protection, the typical position of ACE2-expressing cells in the skin implies that the skin barrier function could be the mediator of SARS-CoV-2. In our study, we found that ACE2 could be expressed in the skin, and its expression level is increased in psoriasis, an inflammatory disease of the skin with barrier dysfunction. Additionally, by applying the SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus on mouse models with or without deteriorated skin barrier, we found that the SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus could infect the skin and lungs of mouse models, and when the skin barrier was impaired, more SARS-CoV-2-infected cells could be found. Thus, we hypothesized that a deteriorated condition of the skin barrier might increase the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection through the skin."

Technologies are being developed and improved to optimize the use of abundant biomass and to generate several value-added products. Efficient nutrient recovery requires additional energy-intensive steps for effective valorization. Moreover, appropriate waste collection and pretreatment practices increase the degree of valorization. The use of biomass waste in biorefineries has significant potential to yield biofuels and organic fertilizers. Further research and development are required to develop effective biorefining technologies to enable the efficient exploitation of bioresources. Greater consideration should be applied to energy pathways to support this technology. Therefore, there is a demand for innovation in the integrated biorefining approach in response to changing markets, and novel commercial models should be introduced into the circular economy."

This paper attempts to assess the impacts of carbon trading on economic output and carbon dioxide emissions reduction in China's industrial sectors by employing the data envelopment analysis (DEA) based optimization models, based on three carbon trading schemes, i.e., no trading (NT), sectoral trading (ST), and sectoral-and-temporal trading (STT) during 2006-2015. Comparing with the no-trading scheme, the results indicate that, (1) the ST and STT schemes may create potential gains of 268.02 and 612.26 trillion yuan in the whole industrial during the study period, i.e., the industrial value-added would be increased by 55.17% and 73.76%, respectively; (2) the ST and STT schemes could reduce 17.17 and 19.22 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions, respectively, accounting for 58.30% and 65.25% of emissions reduction in the whole industry; and (3) if carbon trading were adopted in China since 2006, its carbon intensity of industrial sectors would decrease by 34.89%, 47.44% and 19.80% under the ST scheme, and 58.93%, 31.50% and 10.25% under the STT scheme during the11th, 12th and 13th Five-Year Plan periods, respectively."

A total of 14 alligators from multiple events of increased mortality were subjected to postmortem investigations. Except for one alligator with acute neurologic signs, no premonitory signs were observed. All animals had pneumonia (14/14), coelomitis (14/14), and intravascular short Gram-negative bacilli (14/14). Myocarditis (13/14) was common. Yokenella regensburgei was isolated from all alligators tested (13/13). These data suggest the respiratory tract may be a primary target system and could be involved in transmission, either through exhaled bacteria or through swallowing of contaminated respiratory fluids with passage through the feces. Available sensitivity data for Y. regensburgei in this study indicates in vitro sensitivity to aminoglycosides, fluoroquinolones, chloramphenicol, and trimethoprim/sulphamethoxazole antibiotics. Yokenella regensburgei should be included in the differential diagnosis of septicemia and acute death in alligators."
1648,Efficient design of cold-formed steel bolted-moment connections for earthquake resistant frames,"Ye, Jun; Mojtabaei, Seyed Mohammad; Hajirasouliha, Iman; Pilakoutas, Kypros","Cold-formed steel (CFS) sections can be designed in many configurations and, compared to hot-rolled steel elements, can lead to more efficient and economic design solutions. While CFS moment resisting frames can be used as an alternative to conventional CFS shear-wall systems to create more flexible space plans, their performance under strong earthquakes is questionable due to the inherited low local/distortional buckling of thin-walled CFS elements and limited ductility and energy dissipation capacity of typical CFS bolted-moment connections. To address the latter issue, this paper presents a comprehensive parametric study on the structural behaviour of CFS bolted beam-to-column connections with gusset plates under cyclic loading aiming to develop efficient design solutions for earthquake resistant frames. To simulate the hysteretic moment-rotation behaviour and failure modes of selected CFS connections, an experimentally validated finite element model using ABAQUS is developed, which accounts for both nonlinear material properties and geometrical imperfections. Connection behaviour is modelled using a connector element, simulating the mechanical characteristics of a bolt bearing against a steel plate. The model is used to investigate the effects of bolt arrangement, cross-sectional shape, gusset plate thickness and cross-sectional slenderness on the seismic performance of CFS connections under cyclic loading. The results indicate that, for the same amount of material, folded flange beam sections with diamond or circle bolt arrangements can provide up to 100% and 250% higher ductility and energy dissipation capacity, respectively, compared to conventional flat-flange sections with square bolt arrangement. Using gusset plates with the same or lower thickness as the CFS beam may result in a premature failure mode in the gusset plate, which can considerably reduce the moment capacity of the connection. The proposed numerical model and design configurations can underpin the further development and implementation of CFS bolted-moment connections in seismic regions."

Clinical stroke is only the tip of the iceberg of vascular brain injury that includes covert infarcts, white matter hyperintensities, and microbleeds. Furthermore, an individual's risk for not only stroke but poor brain health includes not only these traditional vascular risk factors but also lifestyle and genetic factors. The purpose of this narrative review is to summarize the state of the evidence on traditional and nontraditional vascular risk factors and their contributions to brain health. Additionally, we will review important modifiers that interact with these risk factors to increase, or, in some cases, reduce risk of adverse brain health outcomes, with an emphasis on genes and biomarkers associated with Alzheimer disease. Finally, we will consider the importance of social determinants of health in brain health outcomes."
1650,The Effect of Renewable and Nuclear Energy Consumption on Decoupling Economic Growth from CO2 Emissions in Spain,"Pilatowska, Mariola; Geise, Andrzej; Wlodarczyk, Aneta","This study examines the relationship between renewable and nuclear energy consumption, carbon dioxide emissions and economic growth by using the Granger causality and non-linear impulse response function in a business cycle in Spain. We estimate the threshold vector autoregression (TVAR) model on the basis of annual data from the period 1970-2018, which are disaggregated into quarterly data to obtain robust empirical results through avoiding a sample size problem. Our analysis reveals that economic growth and CO2 emissions are positively correlated during expansions but not during recessions. Moreover, we find that rising nuclear energy consumption leads to decreased CO2 emissions during expansions, while the impact of increasing renewable energy consumption on emissions is negative but insignificant. In addition, there is a positive feedback between nuclear energy consumption and economic growth, but unidirectional positive causality running from renewable energy consumption to economic growth in upturns. Our findings do indicate that both nuclear and renewable energy consumption contribute to a reduction in emissions; however, the rise in economic activity, leading to a greater increase in emissions, offsets this positive impact of green energy. Therefore, a decoupling of economic growth from CO2 emissions is not observed. These results demand some crucial changes in legislation targeted at reducing emissions, as green energy alone is insufficient to reach this goal."

A change occurs in its size as the spleen performs these functions. This study aims to examine the possible relationships between spleen volume and the basic hemogram and biochemical parameters in serum. Multidetector computed tomography images and basic hemogram and biochemical parameters of 74 adult individuals, 34 male and 40 female, who were found to be healthy, were used in the study. Spleen volume was estimated using the Cavalieri method on multidetector computed tomography images and the correlations between the volume value with basic hemogram and biochemistry parameters were researched. While negative significant correlations were found between the estimated spleen volume and lymphocyte percentage (r=-0.224) and platelet level (r=-0.271); positive significant correlations were found between hemoglobin level (r=0.228), hematocrit level (r=0.237), alanine aminotransferase (r=0.345), and erythrocyte level (r=0.375). As a result of this study, a relationship was found between spleen volume and lymphocyte percentage, hematocrit level, erythrocyte level, platelet level, and alanine aminotransferase level in serum. We believe that the results of the study will provide a larger perspective to clinicians in the diagnosis of diseases associated with spleen."
1652,A Novel Framework of Reservoir Computing for Deterministic and Probabilistic Wind Power Forecasting,"Wang, Jianzhou; Niu, Tong; Lu, Haiyan; Yang, Wendong; Du, Pei","The path towards wind power forecasting has yielded huge socio-economic benefits at a global scale. However, most of the previous studies tend to emphasize the improvement of deterministic forecasting, usually losing sight of the significance of probabilistic forecasting. In this paper, a novel forecasting system that can perform deterministic and probabilistic forecasting of wind power simultaneously, composed by the modules of feature selection, forecasting, system optimization, and system evaluation is presented to further supplement the existing studies in this field. Concretely, a hybrid feature selection strategy is proposed in the feature selection module to determine optimal system input; superior to traditional gradient descent algorithm, a dynamic reservoir theory-based recurrent neural network is developed in the forecasting module; an enhanced multi-objective optimization algorithm with the objectives of accuracy and stability is proposed in the system optimization module to provide an optimal scenario for system parameters; the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed system is then validated in the evaluation module. Moreover, the comprehensive performance analysis of the proposed system is investigated in depth. Finally, the experimental results demonstrate that the proposed system has a significant advantage over the benchmarks considered, further verifying its tremendous potential to be used in a practical wind power system."

GBRTs constantly upgrade to meet rapid development, one of which is achieving a reasonable balance among the ""three pillars"" of sustainability, namely, environmental, social and economic sustainability. This study analyzes the changes and trends in the three sustainability pillars of GBRT and reinforces the previous GBRT longitudinal studies in terms of research sample, time span, equal terms, and research depth. Ten global GBRTs are selected by specific screening principles, and a unified criterion framework is presented to compare these selected GBRTs on equal terms. The changes of GBRTs are then analyzed on three levels, namely, categories, subcategories, and criteria. The results show that in the past three decades, there is a continuous decrease in the weight of the environmental category, an obvious increase in the weight of the social category and a little rise in the wight of the ""economic"" category. ""Pollution,"" ""physical comfort,"" and ""flexibility"" are identified as ""sensitive criteria"" of environmental, social, and economic categories, respectively, given their significant changes; they are also critical factors for the evolution of GBRT for the past three decades.

1655,Value addition in the services sector and its heterogeneous impacts on CO2 emissions: revisiting the EKC hypothesis for the OPEC using panel spatial estimation techniques,"Murshed, Muntasir; Nurmakhanova, Mira; Elheddad, Mohamed; Ahmed, Rizwan","This study examines the Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) hypothesis in the context of 12 members of the OPEC by utilizing data on both the aggregate gross value added and the services' sectoral value-added between 1992 and 2015. This empirical work contributes to the literature by applying the panel spatial techniques which resulted in the findings as follows. Firstly, the results verify the authenticity of the EKC hypothesis for the aggregate level of gross value added as perceived from its inverted-U shaped association with CO2 emissions. Secondly, the disaggregated analysis affirms the heterogeneity of the validity of the EKC hypothesis across the subsectors within the services sector; this justifies the importance of analyzing the EKC hypothesis from a comprehensive (disaggregated) perspective for unearthing key sector-specific policy implications. The results reveal that the EKC hypothesis holds only in the context of construction services only but not for the cases of restaurant services, tourism and transportation services. These key findings call for effective measures to be undertaken to address the adverse environmental impacts that can be attributed to thse three sub-sectors for which the EKC did not hold. In line with the overall findings from the empirical exercises, it is recommended that the concerned OPEC members reduce their monotonic dependency on the consumption of fossil fuels, oil in particular, and gradually incorporate renewable energy resources into the energy-mix particularly within their respective services sector."
1656,Trade liberalization and haze pollution: Evidence from China,"Xu, Yingzhi; Fan, Xiaomin; Zhang, Zhiqian; Zhang, Ruijie","This paper investigates the impacts of trade liberalization on haze pollution using the panel data for 279 Chinese prefecture-level cities during 2007-2016. The relationship of trade liberalization and haze pollution in China was firstly analyzed by using the impulse response function and forecast-error variance decomposition method based on a bivariate vector autoregression model. The results show that trade liberalization is negatively correlated with haze pollution, and the contribution of trade liberalization to the variance of haze pollution exceeds 70% over time. The impact of trade liberalization on haze pollution is further examined applying the two-way fixed effect methods and spatial lag models, concluding that the liberalization of trade has significantly reduced haze pollution. Through mediation effect method, we have found that the haze reduction effect of trade liberalization lies in that the positive influence of technology effect on reducing haze pollution has exceeded the negative influence of scale effect and composition effect on increasing haze pollution. Therefore, in general, trade liberalization has remarkably mitigated haze pollution. The conclusions of this paper will provide a reference for the haze pollution reduction policies and the coordinated development of economic growth and environmental quality."

Following en bloc resection of a giant cell tumour of the distal radius, the wrist was reconstructed by transposing a vascularized pedicle graft from the ipsilateral ulnar shaft. The graft was fixed to the radial shaft and proximal carpal row with plates. At a mean follow-up of 23.5 months (range 18 to 31), bony union was achieved in all cases and there were no tumour recurrences. All patients had a good range of pronation and supination, but flexion and extension of the wrist was limited. DASH scores ranged from 5 to 11. This reconstruction method is a safe and effective procedure that provides good aesthetic outcomes, removes the need for microvascular techniques and reduces donor site morbidity.Level of evidence: IV."

Air quality index and average humidity are selected from the family of climate variables, to determine its impact on the daily new cases of COVID-19-related deaths in Wuhan, China. We have used wavelet analysis (wavelet transform coherence (WTC), partial (PWC), and multiple wavelet coherence (MWC), due to its advantages over traditional time series methods, to study the co-movement nexus between our selected data series. Findings suggest a notable coherence between air quality index, humidity, and mortality in Wuhan during a recent outbreak. Humidity is negatively related to the COVID-19-related deaths, and bad air quality leads to an increase in this mortality. These findings are important for policymakers to save precious human lives by better understanding the interaction of the environment with the COVID-19 disease."
1659,Knockdown of forkhead box protein P1 alleviates hypoxia reoxygenation injury in H9c2 cells through regulating Pik3ip1/Akt/eNOS and ROS/mPTP pathway,"Xinming Liu,Yixing Yang,Jiawei Song,Dongjie Li,Xiaoyan Liu,Chuang Li,Zheng Ma,Jiuchang Zhong,Lefeng Wang,Xinming Liu,Yixing Yang,Jiawei Song,Dongjie Li,Xiaoyan Liu,Chuang Li,Zheng Ma,Jiuchang Zhong,Lefeng Wang","Forkhead box protein P1 (Foxp1) exerts an extensive array of physiological and pathophysiological impacts on the cardiovascular system. However, the exact function of myocardial Foxp1 in myocardial ischemic reperfusion injury (MIRI) stays largely vague. The hypoxia reoxygenation model of H9c2 cells (the rat ventricular myoblasts) closely mimics myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury. This report intends to research the effects and mechanisms underlying Foxp1 on H9c2 cells in response to hypoxia (12 h)/reoxygenation (4 h) (HR) stimulation. Expressions of Foxp1 and Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase interacting protein 1 (Pik3ip1) were both upregulated in ischemia/reperfusion (IR)/HR-induced injury. Stimulation through HR led to marked increases in cellular apoptosis, mitochondrial dysfunction, and superoxide generation in H9c2 cells, which were rescued with knockdown of Foxp1 by siRNA. Silence of Foxp1 depressed expression of Pik3ip1 directly activated the PI3K/Akt/eNOS pathway and promoted nitric oxide (NO) release. Moreover, the knockdown of Foxp1 blunted HR-induced enhancement of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, thus alleviating excessive persistence of mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) opening and decreased mitochondrial apoptosis-associated protein expressions in H9c2 cells. Meanwhile, these cardioprotective effects can be abolished by LY294002, NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME), and Atractyloside (ATR), respectively. In summary, our findings indicated that knockdown of Foxp1 prevented HR-induced encouragement of apoptosis and oxidative stress via PI3K/Akt/eNOS signaling activation by targeting Pik3ip1 and improved mitochondrial function by inhibiting ROS-mediated mPTP opening. Inhibition of Foxp1 may be a promising therapeutic avenue for MIRI."
1660,The fear of being infected and fired: Examining the dual job stressors of hospitality employees during COVID-19,"Chun-Chu Chen,Suiwen Sharon Zou,Ming-Hsiang Chen,Chun-Chu Chen,Suiwen Sharon Zou,Ming-Hsiang Chen","As the COVID-19 pandemic has posed grave threats to the financial and physical health of hospitality employees, this research unveils details of the dilemma experienced by hospitality employees during the pandemic, namely, their fear of becoming infected and fired. The research data were derived from a sample of 622 hospitality employees in the U.S. and analyzed using PLS-SEM as a new model of COVID-19 stressors are proposed and tested. The findings show that hospitality employees perceive the pandemic as a traumatic event that elevates their perceived job insecurity and infectious risk. It was also found that both job insecurity and infectious risk lead to increased job stress and turnover intentions, while job insecurity alone is a stronger predictor of turnover intentions. This study is among the first to examine the antecedents and consequences of the dual stressors encountered by public-facing occupations, including hospitality, during the pandemic."
1661,"Renewable energy, urbanization, and ecological footprint linkage in CIVETS","Nathaniel, Solomon; Nwodo, Ozoemena; Sharma, Gagan; Shah, Muhammad","Emerging economies are mostly plague by a massive consumption of non-renewable energy amidst an ever inceasing urbanization rate with little or no attention to the quality of the environmental. As such, this paper investigates the relationship between renewable energy, urbanization, economic growth, trade openness, and ecological footprint in CIVETS countries, namely, Colombia, Indonesia, Vietnam, Egypt, Turkey, and South Africa. The study employs augmented mean group estimator, panel cointegration, and causality tests. The findings reveal that renewable energy improves environmental quality, and trade is not particularly harmful to the environment. However, non-renewable energy consumption and urbanization are the chief contributors to environmental degradation in the CIVETS countries. Economic expansion mitigates environmental deterioration in Colombia, South Africa, and Turkey, but contributes to pollution in Egypt, Indonesia, and Vietnam. Finally, the causality test suggests that urbanization drives environmental degradation. Policy directions are discussed."

Nevertheless, the risk of cladding quality assurance is increased by the complex cladding formation pattern of multiple multilayers and the unpredictable cross-sectional morphology. In this study, the coupling law of laser power, scanning speed, and powder feeding speed on the geometry of cladding layer is deeply analyzed, and the process-dimension model of single-track melting layers is established. The complex process of laser cladding and the intrinsic laws of process parameters and cladding morphology are revealed by the model. Furthermore, based on the characteristics of the cross-sectional morphology of the cladding layer, a parabolic fitting model of the cross-sectional profile of a single-track cladding layer and an analytical model of the influence of the planar lap of multiple cladding trajectories on the melting width are proposed. Finally, the cross-sectional profile curves of the multilayer cladding were derived and the prediction of the multilayer cladding geometry was achieved. Validation experimental data for laser cladding with 304 powder showed that the average relative errors of melting height and width between the predicted results and the experimental samples were 5.18% and 1.53%, respectively, indicating that the proposed model can accurately predict the cross-sectional shape of the multilayered laser cladding. This study provides experimental data and theoretical prediction methods for the laser remanufacturing of coating profiles on used parts."

However, relapses are possible, and all classes of drugs are refractory to patients. Next-generation sequencing has improved our understanding of the multiple myeloma genome related to drug resistance and has discovered many genomic variants. Therefore, this study was conducted to investigate new variants associated with drug resistance in MM patients who relapsed and refractory to bortezomib regimen and daratumumab treatment using next-generation sequencing for whole-exome sequencing. Peripheral blood samples were collected in EDTA tubes from six patients; four were in relapsed and refractory to bortezomib regimens and daratumumab; two patients responded to bortezomib regimens. Whole-exome sequencing was performed by the MGI-DNBSEQ-G400 instrument. We identified 21 variants in multiple myeloma patients. Seventeen variants were found in relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma in 11 genes (GNAQ, PMS1, CREB1, NSUNS2, PIK3CG, ROS1, PMS2, FIT4, KDM5A, STK11 and ZFHX3). And four variants were identified in two patients with response to bortezomib regimens in 4 genes (RAF1, CREB1, ZFHX3 and INSR). We have observed several genetic variants in many genes that may have been associated with the poor prognosis and poor response to treatment in these patients. These values should be further confirmed in large sample studies using the RNA-seq technique to identify genome expression."

Optimally sizing the PV system and BSS can maximise self-sufficiency, grid relief, and at the same time can be cost-effective by exploiting tariff incentives. To that end, this paper presents a comprehensive optimisation model for the sizing of PV, battery, and grid converter for a microgrid system considering multiple objectives like energy autonomy, power autonomy, payback period, and capital costs. The proposed approach involves developing a holistic techno-economic microgrid model based on variables like PV system power, azimuth angle, battery size, converter ratings, capital investment and electricity tariffs. The proposed method is applied to determine the optimum capacity of a PV system and BSS for two case residential load profiles in the Netherlands and Texas, US to investigate the effect of meteorological conditions on the relative size of PV and battery. Based on the optimisation results, thumb rules for optimal system sizing are derived to facilitate microgrid design engineers during the initial design phase."
1665,The prominence of renewable and non-renewable electricity generation on the environmental Kuznets curve: A case study of Ethiopia,"Usama, Al-mulali; Solarin, Sakiru Adebola; Salahuddin, Mohammad","Ethiopia is one of the fastest growing economies in Africa. During the last three decades, it has been thriving with stupendous efforts for a transition from non-renewable energy use to a renewable energy-dominant economy. It is against this background that this study attempts to highlight the role of renewable energy and non-renewable energy in affecting CO2 emissions under an augmented EKC framework. To achieve this goal, the study exploits data for the period 1981-2015. The Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) model is employed and the results surprisingly revealed that both renewable and non-renewable energy use reduce Ethiopia's CO2 emissions. The unexpected inhibiting effect of nonrenewable energy on CO2 emissions might be attributed to the fact that share of non-renewable energy in the overall energy mix of Ethiopia has become insignificant after experiencing decline consistently during the last three decades. The outcome supports the existence of the EKC hypothesis as well as a N-shaped pattern of association between real GDP per capita and CO2 emissions per capita, particularly in the long run. There is evidence for long run causality, especially from the explanatory variables to CO2 emissions per capita. Policy implications are discussed. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."
1666,"Dynamic interactive effects of urban land-use efficiency, industrial transformation, and carbon emissions","Dong, Yin; Jin, Gui; Deng, Xiangzheng","Clarifying the interactive relationship between urban land-use efficiency (ULUE), industrial transformation, and carbon emissions is of great realistic significance for promoting the coordination of 'resources-economy-environment' and achieving green development. This study used the stochastic frontier analysis (SFA), index method (IM), and remote sensing inversion to calculate the ULUE, the industrial transformation degree (ITD), and the carbon emission intensity (CEI) for 108 cities in the Yangtze River Economic Belt (YREB) from 2005 to 2017, and analyzed their spatiotemporal evolution characteristics. The generalized method of moments (GMM) and impulse response function (IRF) in the panel vector autoregressive (PVAR) model are used to empirically test the dynamic interactive effects of ULUE, ITD, and CEI. The empirical results show that: (i) During the study period, the ULUE and ITD of the YREB increased year-by-year, showing the pattern characteristics of high in the east and low in the west. The CEI decreased by 50.20% cumulatively, and the low-value areas spread from the center of the urban agglomeration towards the periphery. (ii) The GMM shows that there is a significant dynamic dependence between the ULUE, ITD, and CEI. The ULUE has a positive driving effect on the industrial transformation and a negative effects on the CEI in the short term. (iii) The IRF shows that the ULUE and industrial transformation show a synergistic effect of interactive growth. The improvement of the ULUE and industrial restructuring will force the reduction of CEI. The article proposes that the city should take the new urbanization path of resource-conserving, cost-effective, and environment-friendly. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."
1667,Development of sustainable approaches for converting the organic waste to bioenergy,"Dhanya, B. S.; Mishra, Archana; Chandel, Anuj K.; Verma, Madan L.","Dependence on fossil fuels such as oil, coal and natural gas are on alarming increase, thereby causing such resources to be in a depletion mode and a novel sustainable approach for bioenergy production are in demand. Successful implementation of zero waste discharge policy is one such way to attain a sustainable development of bioenergy. Zero waste discharge can be induced only through the conversion of organic wastes into bioenergy. Waste management is pivotal and considering its importance of minimizing the issue and menace of wastes, conversion strategy of organic waste is effectively recommended. Present review is concentrated on providing a keen view on the potential organic waste sources and the way in which the bioenergy is produced through efficient conversion processes. Biogas, bioethanol, biocoal, biohydrogen and biodiesel are the principal renewable energy sources. Different types of organic wastes used for bioenergy generation and its sources, anaerobic digestion-biogas production and its related process affecting parameters including fermentation, photosynthetic process and novel nano-inspired techniques are discussed. Bioenergy production from organic waste is associated with mitigation of lump waste generation and its dumping into land, specifically reducing all hazards and negativities in all sectors during waste disposal. A sustainable bioenergy sector with upgraded security for fuels, tackles the challenging climatic change problem also. Thus, intensification of organic waste conversion strategies to bioenergy, specially, biogas and biohydrogen production is elaborated and analyzed in the present article. Predominantly, persistent drawbacks of the existing organic waste conversion methods have been noted, providing consideration to economic, environmental and social development. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

1668,Air quality during the COVID-19: PM2.5 analysis in the 50 most polluted capital cities in the world,"Rodriguez-Urrego, Daniella; Rodriguez-Urrego, Leonardo","On December 31, 2019, the Chinese authorities reported to the World Health Organization (WHO) the outbreak of a new strain of coronavirus that causes a serious disease in the city of Wuhan, China. This outbreak was classified as SARS-CoV2 and is the cause of the COVID-19 disease. On March 11, 2020, the WHO declares it a Pandemic and today it is considered the greatest challenge in global health that humanity has faced since World War II and it is estimated that between 40 and 60% of the population worldwide will catch the virus. This has caused enormous challenges in countries around the world in social, economic, environmental and obviously health issues. These challenges are mainly due to the effects of the established quarantines in almost all capitals and major cities around the world, from Asia, Europe to America. However, these lockdown which began worldwide from January 23, have had a significant impact on the environment and on the air quality of cities as recently reported by NASA (National Aeronautics and Space Administration) and ESA (European Space Agency), with reductions according to them of up to 30% in some of the epicenters such as the case of Wuhan. Knowing that air pollution causes approximately 29% of lung cancer deaths, 43% of COPD deaths, and 25% of ischemic heart disease deaths, it is important to know the effects of quarantines in cities regarding air quality to take measures that favor populations and urban ecosystems when the emergency ends. Therefore, this paper describes the behavior of PM2.5 emissions particulate matter from the 50 most polluted capital cities in the world according to the WHO, measured before-after the start of the quarantine. Likewise, the impact at the local and global level of this emissions behavior, which averaged 12% of PM2.5 decrease in these cities. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."
1669,The Moderating Effect of Institutional Quality on the Financial Development and Environmental Quality Nexus,"Hunjra, Ahmed Imran; Tayachi, Tahar; Chani, Muhammad Irfan; Verhoeven, Peter; Mehmood, Asad","Environmental sustainability is a major concern of contemporary societies, businesses, and governments. However, there is a lack of knowledge as to how countries can achieve the goal to end poverty, whilst protecting the planet. It is the objective of our study to examine the moderating role of institutional quality on the financial development and environmental quality nexus in South Asia. Our sample consists of panel data of five South Asian countries (India, Bangladesh, Nepal, Sri Lanka and Pakistan) from 1984 to 2018. We find that financial development increases CO2 emissions in this region, implying that countries in South Asia have utilized financial development for capitalization, instead of improving production technology. Institutional quality moderates the negative impact of financial development on environmental sustainability. An implication of our findings is that efforts to improve institutional quality may help to promote sustainable development in South Asia."
1670,Modulation of growth performance and coordinated induction of ascorbate-glutathione and methylglyoxal detoxification systems by salicylic acid mitigates salt toxicity in choysum (Brassica parachinensis L.),"Kamran, Muhammad; Xie, Kaizhi; Sun, Jie; Wang, Dan; Shi, Chaohong; Lu, Yusheng; Gu, Wenjie; Xu, Peizhi","Salinity represents a serious environmental threat to crop production and by extension, to world food supply, social and economic prosperity of the developing world. Salicylic acid (SA) is an endogenous plant signal molecule involved in regulating various plant responses to stress. In the present study, we characterized the regulatory role of exogenous SA for their ability to ameliorate deleterious effects of salt stress (0, 100, 150, 200 mM NaCl) in choysum plants through coordinated induction of antioxidants, ascorbate glutathione (AsA-GSH) cycle, and the glyoxalase enzymes. An increase in salt stress dramatically declined root and shoot growth, leaf chlorophyll and relative water content (RWC), subsequently increased electrolyte leakage (EL) and osmolytes accumulation in choysum plants. Salt stress disrupted the antioxidant and glyoxalase defense systems which persuaded oxidative damages and carbonyl toxicity, indicated by increased H2O2 generation, lipid peroxidation, and methylglyoxal (MG) content. However, application of SA had an additive effect on the growth of salt-affected choysum plants, which enhanced root length, plant biomass, chlorophyll contents, leaf area, and RWC. Moreover, SA application effectively eliminated the oxidative and carbonyl stress by improving AsA and GSH pool, upregulating the activities of antioxidant enzymes and the enzymes associated with AsA-GSH cycle and glyoxalase system. Overall, SA application completely counteracted the salinity-induced deleterious effects of 100 and 150 mM NaCl and partially mediated that of 200 mM NaCl stress. Therefore, we concluded that SA application induced tolerance to salinity stress in choysum plants due to the synchronized increase in activities of enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidants, enhanced efficiency of AsA-GSH cycle and the MG detoxification systems."
1671,Pharmacophore screening to identify natural origin compounds to target RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) of SARS-CoV2,"Avinash Mishra,Anurag S Rathore,Avinash Mishra,Anurag S Rathore","Several existing drugs have gained initial consideration due to their therapeutic characteristics against COVID-19 (Corona Virus Disease 2019). Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) was proposed as possible therapy for shortening the duration of COVID-19, but soon after this, it was discarded. Similarly, known antiviral compounds were also proposed and investigated to treat COVID-19. We report a pharmacophore screening using essential chemical groups derived from HCQ and known antivirals to search a natural compound chemical space. Molecular docking of HCQ under physiological condition with spike protein, 3C-like protease (3CLpro), and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) of SARS-CoV2 showed - 8.52 kcal/mole binding score with RdRp, while the other two proteins showed relatively weaker binding affinity. Docked complex of RdRp-HCQ is further examined using 100 ns molecular dynamic simulation. Docking and simulation study confirmed active chemical moieties of HCQ, treated as 6-point pharmacophore to screen ZINC natural compound database. Pharmacophore screening resulted in the identification of potent hit molecule [(3S,3aR,6R,6aS)-3-(5-phenylsulfanyltetrazol-1-yl)-2,3,3a,5,6,6a-hexahydrofuro[3,2-b]furan-6-yl]N-naphthalen-ylcarbamate from natural compound library. Additionally, a set of antiviral compounds with similar chemical scaffolds are also used to design a separate ligand-based pharmacophore screening. Antiviral pharmacophore screening produced a potent hit 4-[(1,5-dimethyl-3-oxo-2-phenylpyrazol-4-yl)-(2-hydroxyphenyl)methyl]-1,5-dimethyl-2-phenylpyrazol-3-one containing essential moieties that showed affinity towards RdRp. Further, both these screened compounds are docked (- 8.69 and - 8.86 kcal/mol) and simulated with RdRp protein for 100 ns in explicit solvent medium. They bind at the active site of RdRp and form direct/indirect interaction with ASP618, ASP760, and ASP761 catalytic residues of the protein. Successively, their molecular mechanics Poisson Boltzmann surface area (MMPBSA) binding energies are calculated over the simulation trajectory to determine the dynamic atomistic interaction details. Overall, this study proposes two key natural chemical moieties: (a) tetrazol and (b) phenylpyrazol that can be investigated as a potential chemical group to design inhibitors against SARS-CoV2 RdRp."

To date, much research has focused upon stress-induced mitophagy that is largely regulated by the E3 ligase PRKN, with limited insight into the mechanisms regulating basal ""housekeeping"" mitophagy levels in different model organisms. Using iron chelation as an inducer of PRKN-independent mitophagy, we recently screened an siRNA library of lipid-binding proteins and determined that two kinases, GAK and PRKCD, act as positive regulators of PRKN-independent mitophagy. We demonstrate that PRKCD is localized to mitochondria and regulates recruitment of ULK1-ATG13 upon induction of mitophagy. GAK activity, by contrast, modifies the mitochondrial network and lysosomal morphology that compromise efficient transport of mitochondria for degradation. Impairment of either kinase in vivo blocks basal mitophagy, demonstrating the biological relevance of our findings.Abbreviations: CCCP: carbonyl cyanide-m-chlorophenyl hydrazone; DFP: deferiprone; GAK: cyclin G associated kinase; HIF1A: hypoxia inducible factor 1 subunit alpha; PRKC/PKC: protein kinase C; PRKCD: protein kinase C delta; PRKN: parkin RBR E3 ubiquitin protein ligase."
1673,Death by waste: Fashion and textile circular economy case,"Shirvanimoghaddam, Kamyar; Motamed, Bahareh; Ramakrishna, Seeram; Naebe, Minoo","In a circular economy model the way we use the textiles needs to change at a fundamental level. A circular economy is an alternative to a traditional economy (fabrication, use and dispose) in which we keep resources in a loop for as much time as possible, try to maintain their value while in use, and repurpose for generation of new products at the end of utilization. The value of the global fashion industry is 3000 Billion dollars that accounts for more than 2% of the world's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) (https://fashionunited.corn/global-fash ion-industry-statistics/). In the last two decades not only the textile industry has doubled the production but also an average global annual consumption of textiles has doubled from 7 to 13 kg per person and reached to the threshold of 100 million tonnes of textiles consumption. More than two thirds of the textile goes to landfill at the end of their use and just around 15% is recycled. Various scientific studies confirm that the disposal nature of fast fashion and throwaway culture is resulting in a serious environmental, health, social and economic concern. One of the global environmental challenges arising from micro-plastic and micro-textile waste entering into the oceans that can end up in fish and eventually food chain. Herein, through a systematic literature review, the significance of circular fashion and textile is highlighted and various approaches for reuse, recycle and repurposing of the textiles waste as well as disruptive scientific breakthroughs, innovations and strategies towards a circular textile economy have been discussed. Looking into the future, remarks have been made in regards to tackling the key challenges in recycling of textile materials in different stages of their manufacturing process. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

This study compares the municipal solid waste management attributes of cities in Vietnam under uncertainty. The uncertainties include the interrelationships among the attributes, linguistic preferences and qualitative information on the attributes. This study applies exploratory factor analysis to test the validity and reliability of the proposed attributes. Fuzzy set theory is used to translate the linguistic references into the qualitative attributes of municipal solid waste management. The decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory is used to address the interrelationships among the attributes. This study identifies the causal interrelationships among attributes using qualitative information, and a set of 14 attributes is defined and found to be valid and reliable for measurement. The results show that technical integration and social acceptability are the aspects that drive municipal solid waste management. Treatment innovations, safety and health, economic benefits, and technology functionality and appropriateness are determined to be the linkage criteria. The distinctions between cities are identified, Hanoi focuses on the institutional and organizational administration framework, whereas resource efficiency is an aspect of specific concern in Danang, and Ho Chi Minh City prioritized financial and operational requirements and facilities and infrastructure requirements. The implications for theory and practice are discussed."
1675,Assessing agricultural eco-efficiency in Italian Regions,"Coluccia, Benedetta; Valente, Donatella; Fusco, Giulio; De Leo, Federica; Porrini, Donatella","Agriculture plays a key role in providing a wide range of ecosystem services, such as food, feed, fiber and biofuel, thus taking part in the economic development of countries. On the other hand, this sector also gives rise to negative externalities. The eco-efficiency has been considered as a meaningful index for assessing how efficient economic activities are in terms of resource-use and environmental pressures: measuring eco-efficiency provides policy makers with important information for developing policies focused on sustainable management and efficient use of natural resources in the agricultural sector. In this context, sustainable development is now one of the most important objectives of the European Union Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) that has a key role in facing the challenges of the new paradigm of sustainability of agriculture. In this direction, the aim of this paper is to evaluate the eco-efficiency of the Italian agricultural sector, as an index useful for emphasizing the differences among some national geographical areas. This paper tries to fill the lack of scientific studies on agricultural eco-efficiency in Italy, despite the strategic role played by Italy in Europe. For this purpose, the Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) methodology was used, focusing on the integration between agricultural productivity and resource conservation, in order to develop a support tool for policy makers and managers. The analysis had shown a better orientation in saving resources for the Southern Regions and a greater orientation in productivity for the Northern Regions. Overall, Italy seems to have a good capacity for sustainable management of agricultural resources although there is still space for improvement. In this regard, the measurement of eco-efficiency provides a useful index for policy makers to achieve better performances in terms of agricultural sustainability. This means that CAP subsidies should be granted in exchange for specific environmental externalities provided by farmers as a result of more ecologically friendly management with a land use planning avoiding the depleting of Ecosystem Services rich areas, allowing for the achievement of a balance between economic growth and ecosystem protection. Although the paper has expanded the literature on agricultural eco-efficiency, this work has some limitations that could serve as a reference for future studies that can include other ecological variables such as the provision of some ecosystem services that can be enhanced or impacted by agricultural development. Finally, the challenge to realize sustainable agriculture can represent a long-term guarantee of food security as well as societal well-being."
1676,No-till and mulching enhance energy use efficiency and reduce carbon footprint of a direct-seeded upland rice production system,"Yadav, Gulab Singh; Babu, Subhash; Das, Anup; Mohapatra, K. P.; Singh, Raghavendra; Avasthe, R. K.; Roy, Saptamita","Sustainability of conventional agricultural production systems is threatened by triple challenges of energy and environmental crises, deteriorating natural resources bases, and declining farm profitability. Current agricultural management practices (energy-intensive, inefficient external and natural input use, and crop biomass burning) are negatively impacting the ecosystem services which are the principal drivers for food security and human survival. Hence, there is a need to shift from unsustainable production practices to cleaner production systems. Energy use, carbon footprint (CF), and economic sustainability are important indicators of any clean production systems. Thus, a hypothesis was formulated that no-till (NT) cultivation along with mulching can provide an environmentally clean crop production practice that can enhance energy use efficiency, economic profitability, and reduce the CF. Therefore, the present experiment was conducted for four consecutive years (2012-15) to evaluate the energy budget, CF, and economics of NT along with bio-mulching for a cleaner upland rice production system. The experiment comprised of two tillage practices i.e., conventional tillage (CT) and NT in main plots and four bio- mulches in subplots i.e., rice straw mulch (RSM), Gliricidia sepium mulch (GLM), brown manuring mulch (BMM) of cowpea (Vigna unguiculata), and no mulch (NM) as a control. Results revealed that the adoption of NT curtailed energy use by 48.50%, specific energy by 49.63%, CF by 16.48%, and cost of cultivation by 35% in addition to enhancing energy use efficiency and benefit to cost ratio in comparison to CT. It was also observed that mulching, particularly the BMM, boosted the energy use efficiency, economic productivity, net returns, and benefit to cost ratio over NM. The results suggested that NT with BMM is an environmentally clean production technology to enhance the energy use efficiency, besides reducing the CF of direct-seeded upland rice production system in the Eastern Himalayas and similar eco-regions of the world.

1677,"How fairness perceptions, embeddedness, and knowledge sharing drive green innovation in sustainable supply chains: An equity theory and network perspective to achieve sustainable development goals","Zhou, Min; Govindan, Kannan; Xie, Xiongbiao","The response to increasingly serious environmental issues is no longer limited to companies but is an important issue among supply chains. Green innovation is an essential segment of gaining a competitive advantage in the sustainable supply chain to achieve sustainable development goals. However, boosting sustainable supply chain development through green innovation is a complex network activity in which a large number of partners are embedded, and the need exists to transfer or share knowledge in an equal and reasonable exchange process. This study proposes a novel framework to explore perceptions of fairness that include procedural and distributive approaches as antecedents. We also examine embeddedness, knowledge sharing, and green innovation in the sustainable supply chain in terms of equity theory and a network scenario. This study contributes to the sustainable development goals (SDG's) such as Decent Work and Economic Growth (SDG 8); Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure (SDG 9); Responsible Consumption and Production (SDG 12) and Climate Action (SDG 13). Useable sets of data were collected and used to test our theoretical hypotheses by surveying 225 firms in China's manufacturing supply chain sectors. The research model is analysed by the partial least squares structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM) methodology. The empirical findings reveal that perceived fairness constructs that consist of procedural and distributive fairness have a highly positive linkage with embeddedness, while those that do not present significant effects on knowledge sharing directly. Moreover, both embeddedness and knowledge sharing demonstrate significant partial mediating impact on green innovation in the sustainable supply chain; knowledge sharing especially plays a key role in achieving green innovation. This study finds that firm size as a control variable presents a positive effect on green innovation. Finally, conclusions and practical implications are given. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

1678,Political economy of renewable energy: Does institutional quality make a difference in renewable energy consumption?,"Uzar, Umut","The increasingly severe environmental crisis has become one of the most important issues of international debate at present. The acceleration of environmental problems places considerable pressure on individuals, governments, and policymakers. Greenhouse gas emissions caused by fossil-based energy sources have made clean energy sources, such as renewable energy, a strategic choice. Although renewable energy is a key factor in mitigating environmental problems, analysis of its determinants has certain limitations. Despite studies that focus on macroeconomic and environmental determinants of renewable energy, political and institutional factors are neglected. Therefore, to fill the existing gap, the present study analyzes the connection between renewable energy and institutional quality in 38 countries during the period 1990-2015. Economic growth and CO2 emissions are included in the model as control variables. The findings of this study lead to the conclusion that the institutional quality positively affects renewable energy consumption in the long run. Furthermore, CO2 emission is a positive and important determinant of renewable energy consumption. However, economic growth negatively affects renewable energy. In this context, institutional quality is a key strategic choice in promoting the use of renewable energy and solving environmental problems. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."
1679,A novel approach for developing a green Ultra-High Performance Concrete (UHPC) with advanced particles packing meso-structure,Fan Dingqiang; Yu Rui; Shui Zhonghe; Wu Chunfeng; Wang Jinnan; Su Qiqi,"This paper presents a new approach for designing a green Ultra-High Performance Concrete (UHPC) with advanced particles packing meso-structure. To achieve this goal, two mathematical models based on D -Optimal Mixture Design (DOMD) and Genetic Algorithm based Artificial Neural Network (GA-ANN) are firstly established. After detailed comparison, it is demonstrated that the GA-ANN has higher accuracy and practicability compared to DOMD. To experimentally verify that the GA-ANN approach is suitable to be utilized in producing green UHPC, some UHPC specimens are developed based on this model, and their properties (workability, mechanical properties, pore structures and ecological characteristics) are investigated. The obtained experimental results show that the optimized UHPC has higher wet packing density and lower porosity, leading to excellent mechanical properties. Moreover, based on economic and environmental evaluation, the newly developed UHPC exhibits lower cost and environmental impact, something that makes it a sustainable construction product.

1680,"Transcriptome Analysis and Functional Validation Identify a Putative bZIP Transcription Factor, Fpkapc, that Regulates Development, Stress Responses, and Virulence in Fusarium pseudograminearum","Jingya Zhao,Mengya Peng,Wenbo Chen,Xiaoping Xing,Yixuan Shan,Zhuo Fan,Yan Shi,Haiyang Li,Xue Yang,Honglian Li,Linlin Chen,Jingya Zhao,Mengya Peng,Wenbo Chen,Xiaoping Xing,Yixuan Shan,Zhuo Fan,Yan Shi,Haiyang Li,Xue Yang,Honglian Li,Linlin Chen","Fusarium pseudograminearum is a soilborne, hemibiotrophic phytopathogenic fungus that causes Fusarium crown rot and Fusarium head blight in wheat. The basic leucine zipper proteins (bZIPs) are evolutionarily conserved transcription factors that play crucial roles in a range of growth and developmental processes and the responses to biotic and abiotic stresses. However, the roles of bZIP transcription factors remains unknown in F. pseudograminearum. In this study, a bZIP transcription factor Fpkapc was identified to localize to the nucleus in F. pseudograminearum. A mutant strain (Δfpkapc) was constructed to determine the role of Fpkapc in growth and pathogenicity of F. pseudograminearum. Transcriptomic analyses revealed that many genes involved in basic metabolism and oxidation-reduction processes were downregulated, whereas many genes involved in metal iron binding were upregulated in the Δfpkapc strain, compared with the wild type (WT). Correspondingly, the mutant had severe growth defects and displayed abnormal hyphal tips. Conidiation in the Fpkapc mutant was reduced, with more conidia in smaller size and fewer septa than in the WT. Also, relative to WT, the Δfpkapc strain showed greater tolerance to ion stress, but decreased tolerance to H2O2. The mutant caused smaller disease lesions on wheat and barley plants, but significantly increased TRI gene expression, compared with the WT. In summary, Fpkapc plays multiple roles in governing growth, development, stress responses, and virulence in F. pseudograminearum."
1681,Decision-making method of heavy-duty machine tool remanufacturing based on AHP-entropy weight and extension theory,"Du, Yanbin; Zheng, Yashi; Wu, Guoao; Tang, Ying","Heavy-duty machine tools are mostly used in bottleneck processes of manufacturing companies, which have high value-added, high technical content, and large remanufacturing value. The various alternative solutions directly affect the implementation of heavy-duty machine tool remanufacturing as well as its benefits. However, there is currently no scientific and reasonable quantitative method to compare various options and determine the optimal solution. This paper aims to propose a decision-making method of heavy-duty machine tool remanufacturing based on the AHP-entropy weight and extension theory. Firstly, an evaluation criteria system of heavy-duty machine tool remanufacturing is established, covering economic criteria (including remanufacturing cost and remanufacturing time) and technical performance criteria (including accuracy, reliability, processing efficiency, processing range, and ergonomics). Secondly, the decision-making model is presented to determine the optimal alternative solution for heavy-duty machine tool remanufacturing based on extension theory, in which weight for each evaluation criterion is defined by a method of AHP-entropy weight. Finally, combined with the remanufacturing of a heavy-duty horizontal lathe, the proposed decision-making method is verified and analyzed. The results show that the alternative for heavy-duty machine tool remanufacturing determined by this method can obtain better comprehensive benefits and reduce the potential risk of remanufacturing for various stakeholders.

1682,"Renewable and non-renewable energy consumption, economic complexity, CO2 emissions, and ecological footprint in the USA: testing the EKC hypothesis with a structural break","Pata, Ugur Korkut","The economic complexity index, which indicates the level of knowledge and skills needed in the production of the exported goods, is a measure of economic development. Some researchers have investigated the validity of the environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) hypothesis by considering the effect of economic complexity on environmental pollution. This study, for the first time, examines the impact of economic complexity, globalization, and renewable and non-renewable energy consumption on both CO2 emissions and ecological footprint within the framework of the EKC hypothesis in the USA. To this end, the combined cointegration test and three different estimators are utilized for the period from 1980 to 2016. The main finding of the study indicates that the inverted U-shaped EKC relationship between economic complexity and environmental pollution holds for the USA. In addition to this finding, globalization and renewable energy consumption play a dominant role in reducing environmental pollution, while non-renewable energy consumption contributing factor to environmental pressure. Overall, the outcomes indicate that increasing economic complexity helps to minimize environmental degradation after a threshold, and the US government can provide a better environment by using renewable energy sources and globalization."
1683,"The influence of renewable energy use, human capital, and trade on environmental quality in South Africa: multiple structural breaks cointegration approach","Iorember, Paul Terhemba; Jelilov, Gylych; Usman, Ojonugwa; Isik, Abdurrahman; Celik, Bilal","Recent economic and environmental literature suggests that the current state of eneby the British Petroleum Statisticalrgy use in South Africa amidst rapid growing population is unsustainable. Researchers in this area mostly focus on the effect of fossil energy use on carbon (CO2) emission, which represents only an aspect of environmental quality. In contrast, the current study evaluates the influence of renewable energy use, human capital, and trade on ecological footprint--a more comprehensive measure of environmental quality. To this end, the study employs multiple structural breaks cointegration tests (Maki cointegration tests), dynamic unrestricted error correction model through Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) model, and VECM Granger causality tests. The results of the Maki cointegration tests reveal the existence of a cointegration between the variables in all the models with evidence of multiple structural breaks. Further, the ARDL results divulge that an increase in renewable energy use, human capital, and trade improves environmental quality through a decrease in ecological footprint, while an increase in income stimulates ecological footprint. Moreover, causal relationship is found, running from all the variables to renewable energy and trade flow in the long run, while in the short run, economic growth causes ecological footprint. Trade is found to Granger-cause human capital, while human capital causes renewable energy. Additionally, human capital, renewable energy, and economic growth are predictors of trade. The study therefore recommends South African policymakers to consider the importance of renewable energy, human capital development, and trade as a policy option to reduce ecological footprint and improve environmental quality."
1684,An update of the benchmark post-combustion CO2-capture technology,"Feron, Paul H. M.; Cousins, Ashleigh; Jiang, Kaiqi; Zhai, Rongrong; Garcia, Monica",This study provides a description of a new benchmark post-combustion CO2 capture (PCC) technology reflecting the publicly reported performances by various technology suppliers. To achieve this several amines and amine formulations have been considered using a process model developed in ProTreat (R). A 40 wt% formulation of PZ (piperazine)/AMP (amino-methyl-propanol) in a 1:2 M ratio was selected as the most representative of the current state of the art. A PCC process configuration with absorber intercooling and rich split flow was selected to reflect the fact that the technology suppliers use a variety of process designs to optimize the process performance. The techno-economic performances were further detailed for the PCC process integrated with an ultra-supercritical coal fired power station and a natural gas fired combined-cycle. The techno-economic evaluation of the PCC process indicated that the costs of capture with respect to 30 wt% MEA for the coal-fired power station were reduced by 22% and for the natural gas fired combined-cycle by 15%.
1685,Nanomedicine formulations for respiratory infections by inhalation delivery: Covid-19 and beyond,"Oron Zachar,Oron Zachar","For respiratory infections treatment and prevention, we analyze for the first time the possibility of providing a broad range medication based on metallic nanoparticles colloids (NpC) delivery by controlled aerosol inhalation. (i) Based on in-vitro data combined with aerosol deposition characteristics in the respiratory system, we calculate the required effective formulations, dosages and delivery parameters for an aerosol inhalation treatment. The goal is to achieve an effective NpC inhibitory concentration (IC) in the target airway surface liquid (ASL); (ii) We evaluate the clinical safety of such dosages, drawing on information from animal testing data and regulatory limits in the USA for such nanoparticles aerosol inhalation safety. Our analysis indicates a wide range of potentially safe and effective dosages that can be clinically explored, targeting the upper respiratory and bronchial tree system. Similar dosages can also provide antibacterial effectiveness for prophylactic treatment in hospital intensive care units to lower the risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Our calculations are phenomenological, independent of mechanisms. Nevertheless, we highlight a mechanism of action by which any suitably designed NpC, with nanoparticles sized 2-10 nm and having a large negative zeta-potential, preferentially bind to viruses with predominantly positively-charged spike proteins. These will be ineffective against viruses with predominantly negatively-charged spike proteins. Accordingly, the popular silver metal base for NpC serves just as a construction ingredient, and other metal or metal-oxides which can serve to construct the noted nanoparticle properties would be similarly effective. We suggest that inhalation delivery of the proposed antiviral formulations could be applied as a first-line intervention while respiratory infections are primarily localized to the upper respiratory system and bronchial tree."

Additionally, some physical and quality characteristics, phenolic contents (by LC-MS/MS; Liquid Chromatography Tandem Mass/Mass Spectrometer System), anticholinesterase, and antioxidant capacities (DPPH; 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl free-radical scavenging, ABTS; 2,2-azinobis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonic acid cation-radical scavenging activity and CUPRAC; cupric reducing antioxidant capacity) of the cultivars were investigated on ground raisins. In all three methods, the antioxidant activity values of seed extracts were determined to be higher than those of leaf and pulp extracts. Remarkably, the seed extract of Banazı Siyahı showed the highest antioxidant activity in ABTS (IC50 : 4.35±0.02 μg/mL), DPPH (IC50 : 10.78±0.78 μg/mL), and CUPRAC (A0.5: 9.33±0.45 μg/mL) methods. Additionally, the ethanol extracts of all pulp samples showed higher anticholinesterase activity against acetyl-(AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) enzymes than galantamine. According to the LC-MS/MS results, catechin (21.362 mg analyte/g extract) and epicatechin (44.667 mg analyte/g extract) found to be quite rich in Kerküş seed extract and isoquercitrin (116.873 mg analyte/g extract) and astragalin (31.915 mg analyte/g extract) detected to be quite rich in Banazı Siyahı leaf extract. Considering the mineral content of the varieties and the soil samples they grow in, all of the grape varieties analyzed in the study was found to be rich. Based on these findings, it might be suggested that Banazı Siyahı and Kerküş varieties have potential to be utilized in pharmaceutical and food industries, due to their contents of catechins, isoquercitrin and astragalin."

Wells in Bahabad Plain, located in Yazd Province, Iran, are the primary source of water demanded by humans for drinking and agricultural activities. Hence, it is pivotal to examine the quality of groundwater resources, which is the main objective of this study. To this end, seventeen water samples collected in the region were using standard sampling methods, and ten parameters were examined from the samples, namely pH, TH, TDS, SO4, HCO3, Cl-, K+, Ca+, Mg+, and Na+. Water quality index (WQI) was used to determine water quality, and SI, GODS, and DRASTIC methods were used to examine aquifer vulnerability to contamination. Schoeller's diagram indicated that 11% of the samples were at an excellent level; 33% were at a drinkable level; 20% were at a not-suitable level for drinking; 26% were terrible for drinking; and 10% were at an almost non-drinkable level. According to WQI results, 23.53% of the samples had no limitation for drinking, 35.29 were of low quality, 17.65% were of inferior quality, and 23.53% were non-drinkable. The GODS method results indicated that the eastern, central, western, and small parts sporadically scattered in northern regions of the study area (39.93%) had a moderate vulnerability. Lastly, a significant portion of the northern and southern districts (60.07%) was found to have a low vulnerability to contamination, which was in line with WQI results."
1688,Characteristics of retracted editorial articles in the biomedical literature,"Bakthavachalam Elango,Bakthavachalam Elango","The main purpose of this short communication is to identify and analyze retracted editorials in the biomedical literature. Twenty-five of the 33 editorials are chosen for further analysis. All of the editorials were published as commentaries and concise reviews between 1998 and 2021. Due to plagiarism and data-related issues, the majority of the editorial articles were retracted. Alarmingly, one-fifth of the editorials were funded by external agencies, with the USA leading the list of retracted editorials. The average time between the publication of the editorials and their retraction is 2.48 years, and two editorials were retracted with the longest durations; both were written by the same author. The conclusion is that, at the very least, editorial articles should be devoid of research/scientific misconduct."
1689,"How Is Mortality Affected by Fossil Fuel Consumption, CO2 Emissions and Economic Factors in CIS Region?","Rasoulinezhad, Ehsan; Taghizadeh-Hesary, Farhad; Taghizadeh-Hesary, Farzad","It is widely discussed that GDP growth has a vague impact on environmental pollution due to carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuels consumed in production, transportation, and power generation. The main purpose of this study is to investigate the relationships between economic growth, fossil fuel consumption, mortality (from cardiovascular disease (CVD), diabetes mellitus (DM), cancer, and chronic respiratory disease (CRD), and environmental pollution since environmental pollution can be a reason for societal mortality rate increases. This study uses the generalized method of moments (GMM) estimation technique for the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) members for the period from 1993-2018. The major results revealed that the highest variability of mortality could be explained by CO2 variability. Regarding fossil fuel consumption, the estimation proved that this variable positively affects mortality from CVD, DM, cancer, and CRD. Additionally, any improvements in the human development index (HDI) have a negative effect on mortality increases from CVD, DM, cancer, and CRD in the CIS region. It is recommended that the CIS members implement different policies to improve energy transitions, indicating movement from fossil fuel energy sources to renewable sources. Moreover, we recommend the CIS members enhance various policies for easy access to electricity from green sources and increase the renewable supply through improved technologies, sustainable economic growth, and increase the use of green sources in daily social life."

Recent studies have begun to uncover the molecular processes associated with these relationships, but the degree to which they vary across different dimensions of the social environment remains unclear. Here, we draw on a long-term field study of wild baboons to compare the signatures of affiliative and competitive aspects of the social environment in white blood cell gene regulation, under both immune-stimulated and non-stimulated conditions. We find that the effects of dominance rank on gene expression are directionally opposite in males versus females, such that high-ranking males resemble low-ranking females, and vice versa. Among females, rank and social bond strength are both reflected in the activity of cellular metabolism and proliferation genes. However, while we observe pronounced rank-related differences in baseline immune gene activity, only bond strength predicts the fold-change response to immune (lipopolysaccharide) stimulation. Together, our results indicate that the directionality and magnitude of social effects on gene regulation depend on the aspect of the social environment under study. This heterogeneity may help explain why social environmental effects on health and longevity can also vary between measures. This article is part of the theme issue 'The centennial of the pecking order: current state and future prospects for the study of dominance hierarchies'."
1691,"Solar energy potential assessment: A framework to integrate geographic, technological, and economic indices for a potential analysis","Zhang, Yuhu; Ren, Jing; Pu, Yanru; Wang, Peng","To develop solar energy as a primary source of electricity supply in China, it is imperative to also develop an overall and complete solar energy potential analysis. Such an analysis technique would be a substantial contribution to solar power generation development both nationally and regionally. This study analyzes the spatial and temporal distribution of solar energy in China and estimates the solar energy potential from three aspects: geography, technology, and economy. The results of this research showed that the solar energy resource in China is substantially rich and stable, but also has notable spatial heterogeneity. A potential estimation indicated that Xinjiang Province was the most optimal site for large-scale photovoltaic station construction, displaying the highest values for all three potentials. It was also found that solar energy potential in western China is greater, while the eastern region is less suitable for solar photovoltaic development. These results can provide support for the large-scale development and utilization of solar energy resources in the future. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."
1692,Economic and resource and environmental carrying capacity trade-off analysis in the Haihe River basin in China,"Fu, Jiayi; Zang, Chuanfu; Zhang, Junmao","Resources and environment provide the fundamental conditions for human beings to live. Coordinating the relationship between resources and environmental protection and economic development is a necessary measure for humans to pursue sustainable development. To explore the Haihe River basin's economic and resource carrying capacity development, 26 indexes from 2000 to 2016 were selected based on pressure state response model selection. Through the TOPSIS model, the entropy method, the exponential smoothing method, and the Hurst index, the comprehensive capacity of the Haihe River is constructed. This study aims to quantify each carrying capacity of the Haihe River basin and analyse their levels and characteristics, with an emphasis on the trade-off analysis between economic carrying capacity and resource and environmental carrying capacity; finally, the study aims to predict the development of each type of carrying capacity. The results showed that in the Haihe River basin, there's dramatic change in comprehensive carrying capacity's level and subsystems from 2000 to 2016. The resource and environmental carrying capacity have negative correlation with economic carrying capacity, while a positive correlation between talent carrying capacity and economic carrying capacity. Based on prediction, from 2017 to 2021, the level of development of each capacity subsystem indicated an increase in sustainability. This research provides a trade-off analysis between the economic and resource and environmental carrying capacity. The study also offers a theoretical basis to the coordinated development of various carrying capacities, which has reference significance for promoting the sustainable development of the river basin.

1693,The role of technology innovation and people's connectivity in testing environmental Kuznets curve and pollution heaven hypotheses across the Belt and Road host countries: new evidence from Method of Moments Quantile Regression,"An, Hui; Razzaq, Asif; Haseeb, Muhammad; Mihardjo, Leonardus W. W.","The Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) is closely linked to the ecological sustainability of the infrastructure ventures that intrinsically include the aspects of climate change and pollution. Though there exists literature on the environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) and pollution haven hypothesis (PHH), very few explore the scope in the light of Belt and Road host countries (B&RCs). Therefore, the study examines the income-induced EKC and Chinese outward foreign direct investment (FDI)-based PHH in the multivariate framework of people's connectivity and technology innovation in B&RCs from 2003 to 2018. The outcome of the study reveals that the observed relationship is quantile-dependent, which may disclose misleading results in previous studies using traditional methodologies that address the averages. Utilizing the novel ""Method of Moments Quantile Regression (MMQR)"" of Machado and Silva (J Econom 213:145-173, 2019), the findings confirm an inverted U-shape association between economic growth and CO(2)emissions only at lower to medium emission countries, thus validating the EKC hypothesis. The Chinese outward FDI flows increase carbon emissions at medium to high emission countries, thereby confirming PHH. The findings also indicate that people's connectivity contributes to increasing emissions while innovation mitigates carbon emissions at lower to medium polluted countries. Moreover, the outcomes of Granger causality confirm one-way causality between economic growth and CO(2)emissions, between FDI and CO(2)emissions, between people's connectivity and CO(2)emissions, and between innovation and CO(2)emissions. The results offer valuable insight for legislators to counteract CO(2)emissions in B&RCs through innovation-led energy conservation in infrastructure projects while adopting green and sustainable financing mechanisms to materialize mega construction projects under the BRI."
1694,The long-term spatial and temporal distribution of aerosol optical depth and its associated atmospheric circulation over Southeast Africa,"Matthews Nyasulu,Md Mozammel Haque,Bathsheba Musonda,Cao Fang,Matthews Nyasulu,Md Mozammel Haque,Bathsheba Musonda,Cao Fang","Recent studies have revealed significant impact of anthropogenic aerosols to both climate and human health. Even though significant efforts have been made across the globe, studies related to aerosols over Southeast Africa remain scanty, hence causing high uncertainty in predicting and understanding the impacts of these aerosols. The present study therefore analyzed long-term spatial and temporal distribution of aerosol optical depth at 550 nanometer wavelength (AOD550) over the entire Southeast Africa. Relatively low AOD550 has been detected over the region in comparison to highly polluted regions across the globe. The highest annual average (>0.2) was observed over Lake Malawi, Zambezi valley, and the coastal areas of Central Mozambique while low annual values were recorded over northeast of Mozambique, and the eastern areas of Zimbabwe. In terms of seasonality, AOD550 was observed to be high (>0.3) during the dry months of September-October-November (SON) while being low (<0.1) during March-April-May (MAM) and June-July-August (JJA) in most areas. The seasonality of AOD550 was observed to be highly influenced by changes in seasonal biomass burning and seasonal atmospheric circulation. Statistical analyses revealed an insignificant change of AOD550 between 2002 and 2020 in most areas of the study domain. Regional open burning of biomass like bush fires and burning of crop residues during the dry months are the main sources of aerosol concentration. Therefore, the present study advocates the regulation and institutionalization of proactive and strategic mechanisms that curtail open burning activities within the region."

A scoping review,"Matthew Warren-James,Natalie Dodd,Chantal Perera,Lisa Clegg,Helen M Stallman,Matthew Warren-James,Natalie Dodd,Chantal Perera,Lisa Clegg,Helen M Stallman","Exposure to repeated trauma is an inherent component of paramedicine. Additionally, paramedics are exposed to threats that can undermine healthy workplaces, social connectedness, and health behaviour, predisposing them to overwhelming distress and unhealthy coping, including suicidality and psychiatric disorders. This scoping review aimed to identify how paramedics cope. PubMed, PsycINFO and CINAHL were searched between January 1, 2010, to April 21, 2021. Studies were included if they used any research design to identify specific coping strategies used by paramedics. Three studies met the inclusion criteria-two qualitative and one cross-sectional survey design. There was a high risk of bias across all studies. Studies were conducted in Israel, Poland, and the UK, primarily with males. Two studies only identified healthy coping strategies-self-soothing and social and professional support. Unhealthy strategies identified in the third study were limited to negative self-talk and alcohol use, with no mention of other harmful behaviours, social withdrawal, or suicidality. There is limited research describing how paramedics cope, and in particular, how female paramedics cope. Further research exploring the breadth of coping strategies used by paramedics is needed to understand the impact of the work paramedics undertake on coping and inform prevention and support activities."
1696,Machine learning approaches for spatial modeling of agricultural droughts in the south-east region of Queensland Australia,"Rahmati, Omid; Falah, Fatemeh; Dayal, Kavina Shaanu; Deo, Ravinesh C.; Mohammadi, Farnoush; Biggs, Trent; Moghaddam, Davoud Davoudi; Naghibi, Seyed Amir; Dieu Tien Bui","A quantitative understanding of the hydro-environmental factors that influence the occurrence of agricultural drought events would enable more strategic climate change adaptation and drought management plans. Practical drought hazard mapping remains challenging due to possible exclusion of the most pertinent drought drivers, and to the use of inadequate predictive models that cannot describe drought adequately. This research aims to develop new approaches to map agricultural drought hazard with state-of-the-art machine learning models, including classification and regression trees (CART), boosted regression trees (BRT), random forests (RF), multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS), flexible discriminant analysis (FDA) and support vector machines (SVM). Hydro-environmental datasets were used to calculate the relative departure of soil moisture (RDSM) for eight severe droughts for drought-prone southeast Queensland, Australia, over the period 1994-2013. RDSM was then used to generate an agricultural drought inventory map. Eight hydro-environmental factors were used as potential predictors of drought. The goodness-of-fit and predictive performance of all models were evaluated using different threshold-dependent and threshold-independent methods, including the true skill statistic (TSS), Efficiency (E), F-score, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUCROC). The RF model (AUC-ROC = 97.7%, TSS = 0.873, E = 0.929, F-score = 0.898) yielded the highest accuracy, while the MA model (with AUC-ROC = 73.9%, TSS = 0.424, E = 0.719, F-score = 0.512) showed the worst performance. The plant available water holding capacity (PAWC), mean annual precipitation, and day content were the most important variables to be used for predicting the agricultural drought. About 21.2% of the area is in high or very high drought risk classes, and therefore, warrant drought and environmental protection policies. Importantly, the models do not require data on the precipitation anomaly for any given drought year; the spatial patterns in AGH were consistent for all drought events, despite very different spatial patterns in precipitation anomaly among events. Such machine-learning approaches are able to construct an overall risk map, thus assisting in the adoption of a robust drought contingency planning measure not only for this area, but also, in other regions where drought presents a pressing challenge, including its influence on key practical dimensions of social, environmental and economic sustainability.

1697,Study on coupling coordination and spatiotemporal heterogeneity between economic development and ecological environment of cities along the Yellow River Basin,"Liu, Ke; Qiao, Yurong; Shi, Tao; Zhou, Qian","The Yellow River Basin (YRB) is an important ecological barrier and an important economic zone in China. Under the new requirements of realizing ecological protection and high-quality development of the YRB, the coordinated development of basin economic development and ecological environment is an urgent research topic. Taking 36 cities along the Yellow River Basin as samples, this paper constructs an evaluation index system of economic development and ecological environment. The coupling coordination model and geographical weighted regression were adopted to analyze the coupling coordination relationship between economic development and ecological environment from 2008 to 2017, and the influencing factors were analyzed. The results showed that (1) the coupling coordination of urban economic development and ecological environment along the YRB showed significant regional heterogeneity, forming a low-value sag of the Loess Plateau; (2) the regional hot spots in the downstream of the YRB continuously extended inland, while these in the midstream converged; (3) the coupling coordination degree between economic development and ecological environment is affected by factors such as population size, openness, and advanced industrial structure, and the intensity varies significantly among regions."

Food consumption and production has not only been impacted by the crisis, but it may have also contributed to causing the pandemic. After providing a brief introductory framework, the paper presents the results of a pilot study on the link between COVID-19 and the food system, as indicated by the social media activity of selected European Union (EU) Twitter accounts, measured using an original ""theme popularity"" metric. Thereafter, a systematic review of the literature is proposed to identify the causes of the rise in popularity of a sustainable food system theme, the potential consequences of the COVID-19 crisis for the food system (targeting the production, consumption and waste disposal phases) and possible solutions, focusing on the circular economy. Challenges and opportunities for policymakers in the short and long term are discussed. A holistic approach is advocated, as the global food system is intimately connected with society and requires deep cooperation among nation states and economic actors."

1700,The impact of digital technology usage on economic growth in Africa,"Solomon, Edna Maeyen; van Klyton, Aaron","This study analyses the impact of the use of digital technology on economic growth for 39 African countries from 2012 to 2016. This analysis applies a system GMM estimator to understand the extent to which the usage of digital technology facilitates growth using a measure of digitalisation from the Networked Readiness Index. Unlike previous research, we distinguish between the impact of individual, business, and government ICT usage on growth and show that only individual usage has a positive impact. Furthermore, a disaggregated analysis of the types of usage reveals that two indicators, social media and the importance of ICTs to government vision, are significant for growth."
1701,Crossover Effects of Education on Health within Married Couples,"Andrew Halpern-Manners,Elaine M Hernandez,Tabitha G Wilbur,Andrew Halpern-Manners,Elaine M Hernandez,Tabitha G Wilbur","Although empirical work has shown that personal and spousal education are both related to health, the nature of these associations has been harder to establish. People select into marriages on the basis of observed and hard-to-observe characteristics, complicating the job of the researcher who wishes to make causal inferences. In this article, we implement a within-sibling-pair design that exploits variation within pairs in spousal education to generate estimates of spousal crossover effects. Results-based on a long-term study of siblings and their spouses-suggest that spousal education is positively related to health, but to a greater degree for women than men. Sensitivity analyses show that these patterns are unlikely to derive from measured differences between individuals or unmeasured characteristics that sort them into unions. These results are consistent with network-based theories of social capital, which view education as a resource that can be mobilized by network ties to enhance health."
1702,Does an N-shaped association exist between pollution and ICT in Turkey? ARDL and quantile regression approaches,"Baris-Tuzemen, Ozge; Tuzemen, Samet; Celik, Ali Kemal","It is a debated issue that the influence of information and communications technologies (ICTs) on the environment is positive or negative in the literature. For instance, usage and disposal of ICTs may lead to environmental degradation and it may also increase carbon emission arising from electricity generation. However, ICT applications may contribute to environmental quality creating great opportunities for smarter cities, transport systems, electrical grids, and industrial processes. These two effects reveal the possible relationship of an inverted U-shaped association also known as the environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) hypothesis relationship between ICT and CO2. The objective of this study is to determine the structure of the relationship between environmental degradation and ICTs in Turkey for 1980-2017. The findings of the autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) analysis indicate the validity of inverted N-shaped EKC hypothesis. However, the results of the quantile regression test are inconsistent with those of ARDL. When the coefficients from 30th to 95th quantiles are examined, it is observed that there is an inverted N-shaped relationship between ICT and CO2, but these coefficients are not statistically significant. In addition, in the 95th quantile, coefficients of the square of ICT and ICT are statistically significant, contrary to the cube of ICT which is not. This reveals that the relationship between the variables is U-shaped."
1703,"[Scale of Eating Behavior Phenotypes (EFCA), confirmatory factor analysis and psychometric properties]","Vanesa Erica Anger,Jesica Formoso,Mónica Teresa Katz,Vanesa Erica Anger,Jesica Formoso,Mónica Teresa Katz","Introduction: weight gain depends on multiple modifiable mediating factors, including ingestive behavior phenotype. The Eating Behavior Phenotypes Scale (EFCA) is a self-administered questionnaire designed as a tool for clinical use to characterize different sub-phenotypes of ingestive behavior: hedonic, compulsive, emotional grazing, disorganized and hyperphagic. Objectives: the aim of this study is to validate the psychometric properties of the Eating Behavior Phenotypes Scale (EFCA), to analyze the stability of the construct and its external validity. Materials and methods: three hundred adult participants completed a self-administered survey developed to identify eating behavior phenotypes (EFCA). A confirmatory factor analysis was performed, internal consistency was evaluated using Cronbach's alpha coefficient, and concurrent validity was assessed using Pearson's correlation method between EFCA and BMI. Results: the EFCA scale and the subscales showed an acceptable internal consistency (α > 0.70). The confirmatory factor analysis showed a good adjustment of the data to the proposed structure (SBχ922 = 155, p < 0.05; CFI = 0.97; TLI = 0.96; RMSEA = 0.05; SRMR = 0.04). A positive and statistically significant correlation was found between BMI and both each subscale and total scale scores. Conclusions: EFCA and its subscales are a valid instrument to assess eating phenotypes in adults. The five-component structure shows high stability and consistent results in relation to a previous study carried out with a sample of obese patients."

For the purpose of age estimation, various markers within the skeletal framework are employed. Degenerative morphological changes in the skeleton can be used for age estimation in adults. Amongst the various bones, age-progressive changes in the innominate bone are of particular significance in age estimation. Within the pelvis, the acetabulum presents as a durable and well-preserved evidence, characteristic manifestations of which can be employed for age estimation. The present study aimed at a CT-based evaluation of acetabular changes for the purpose of age estimation in an Indian population. CT images of 250 individuals aged 10-88 years were scrutinized according to the features defined in the Calce method of acetabular age estimation. Scores were allotted to the various features and a cumulative score was calculated. No significant bilateral and sex differences were observed. Significant correlation was obtained between the scores for these defined characteristics and the chronological age of individuals. Population-specific regression models were generated for age estimation. The scoring method devised in the present research requires further validation as it represents a new tool for age estimation in medico-legal cases."
1705,Comparison of tablet splitting techniques for dosing accuracy of nebivolol tablets: Hand splitting versus tablet cutter and knife,"Seval Olgac,Duygu Yilmaz Usta,Tuba Incecayir,Seval Olgac,Duygu Yilmaz Usta,Tuba Incecayir","Tablet splitting is a common practice in clinical settings to lower doses, facilitate swallowing or save costs. Splitting devices can be used when hand splitting is difficult or painful. However, data on the accuracy of tablet splitting are limited and it presents a number of patient or formulation-related problems. Thirty nebivolol IR tablets on the Turkish market were split by hand, a tablet cutter (Rabır®) or a knife, and tested for weight variation, loss of mass, disintegration, and friability. The accuracy of split tablets was in the range of 75.4-121, 82.4-115, and 86.9-115% when split by hand, the cutter, and knife, respectively. No significant difference in accuracy was determined between the left and right sides split by the cutter (p = 0.222). The differences were significant for hand and knife splittings (p < 0.005). The precision was 9.02, 7.87, and 6.11% (CV%) for hand, tablet cutter, and knife, respectively. Only hand splitting failed to comply with the subdivision test of European Pharmacopoeia. The split portions met USP standards for friability (<1%). Splitting decreased the disintegration time (4.5 vs. 2.2 min). Overall, the accuracy of the tablet cutter was more favorable than hand splitting and knife. The study demonstrated that the splitting technique may result in inaccurate dosing and significant drug fluctuations for nebivolol tablets."

Protein degradation pathways, such as the ubiquitin proteasomes system, autophagy, and endosome-lysosome pathway, must be tightly regulated to ensure proper elimination of misfolded and aggregated proteins and regulate changing protein levels during cellular differentiation, while ensuring that normal proteins remain unscathed. Protein degradation pathways have also garnered interest as a means to selectively eliminate target proteins that may be difficult to inhibit via other mechanisms. On June 7 and 8, 2021, several experts in protein degradation pathways met virtually for the Keystone eSymposium ""Targeting protein degradation: from small molecules to complex organelles."" The event brought together researchers working in different protein degradation pathways in an effort to begin to develop a holistic, integrated vision of protein degradation that incorporates all the major pathways to understand how changes in them can lead to disease pathology and, alternatively, how they can be leveraged for novel therapeutics."
1707,Dietary determinants of healthy/unhealthy metabolic phenotype in individuals with normal weight or overweight/obesity: a systematic review,"Behnaz Abiri,Majid Valizadeh,Lara Nasreddine,Farhad Hosseinpanah,Behnaz Abiri,Majid Valizadeh,Lara Nasreddine,Farhad Hosseinpanah","Objectives: Nutritional factors are amongst the major determinants in the onset and development of obesity and metabolic complications. Nevertheless, the dietary determinants of metabolic health are not completely elucidated. The aim of this systematic review is to investigate nutritional and dietary factors that may contribute to metabolic heterogeneity in individuals with obesity or normal weight. Methods: A literature search was performed in PubMed, Scopus, EMBASE, and google scholar databases until August 2021, to locate studies that examined metabolic health and its association with intakes of specific foods or food groups, nutrient intakes or status, as well as adherence to certain dietary patterns. Two researchers had independently screened titles and abstracts, examined full-text studies, conducted data extraction, and evaluated their quality using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Results: Twenty-seven studies, with a total of 39518 subjects, were included. Of these studies, 11 articles evaluated the association between different dietary patterns and metabolic phenotypes, while 15 had investigated the association of single food/nutrients intakes or nutrient status with metabolic phenotype, and one paper evaluated the association of dietary inflammatory index with metabolic health. The findings of these studies propose that healthy dietary patterns such as the Mediterranean pattern, Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension, and population-derived patterns (such as the ""Healthy"" and ""Fruit and vegetable"" patterns) were associated with higher odds of the metabolically healthy phenotype. Higher intakes of fruits, vegetables, dairy products, coffee/tea, vitamin D, magnesium, and flavonoids, were suggested to lower the risk of developing metabolically unhealthy phenotype, while, higher consumption of saturated fat, carbohydrate and sugar-sweetened beverages, fast foods, organ meats, and a pro-inflammatory diet increased the risk. Conclusion: Results from published studies, which were mostly cross-sectional, suggest that higher adherence to unhealthier dietary patterns, characterized by the consumption of refined and processed foods, was associated with a lower likelihood of having a healthy metabolic phenotype, while the opposite was observed for healthier dietary patterns. Findings may be used in developing nutritional strategies aimed at improving metabolic health in the population."

NAEMSP recommends:Airway management should be approached as an organized system of care, incorporating principles of teamwork and operational awareness.EMS clinicians should prevent or correct hypoxemia and hypotension prior to advanced airway insertion attempts.Continuous physiological monitoring must be used during airway management to guide the timing of, limit the duration of, and inform decision making during advanced airway insertion attempts.Initial and ongoing confirmation of advanced airway placement must be performed using waveform capnography. Airway devices must be secured using a reliable method.Perfusion, oxygenation, and ventilation should be optimized before, during, and after advanced airway insertion.To mitigate aspiration after advanced airway insertion, EMS clinicians should consider placing a patient in a semi-upright position.When appropriate, patients undergoing advanced airway placement should receive suitable pharmacologic anxiolysis, amnesia, and analgesia. In select cases, the use of neuromuscular blocking agents may be appropriate."
1709,Complement blockade with eculizumab to treat acute symptomatic humoral rejection after heart transplantation,"Patrick Yerly,Samuel Rotman,Julien Regamey,Vincent Aubert,Stefania Aur,Matthias Kirsch,Roger Hullin,Manuel Pascual,Patrick Yerly,Samuel Rotman,Julien Regamey,Vincent Aubert,Stefania Aur,Matthias Kirsch,Roger Hullin,Manuel Pascual","Antibody-mediated rejection (AMR) is a major barrier preventing successful discordant organ xenotransplantation, but it also occurs in allotransplantation due to anti-HLA antibodies. Symptomatic acute AMR is rare after heart allograft but carries a high risk of mortality, especially >1 year after transplant. As complement activation may play a major role in mediating tissue injury in acute AMR, drugs blocking the terminal complement cascade like eculizumab may be useful, particularly since ""standards of care"" like plasmapheresis are not based on strong evidence. Eculizumab was successfully used to treat early acute kidney AMR, a typical condition of ""active AMR,"" but showed mitigated results in late AMR, where ""chronic active"" lesions are more prevalent. Here, we report the case of a heart recipient who presented with acute heart failure due to late acute AMR with eight de novo donor-specific anti-HLA antibodies (DSA), and who fully recovered allograft function and completely cleared DSA following plasmapheresis-free upfront eculizumab administration in addition to thymoglobulin, intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIG), and rituximab. Several clinical (acute onset, abrupt and severe loss of graft function), biological (sudden high-level production of DSA), and pathological features (microvascular injury, C4d deposits) of this cardiac recipient are shared with early kidney AMR and may indicate a strong role of complement in the pathogenesis of acute graft injury that may respond to drugs like eculizumab. Terminal complement blockade should be further explored to treat acute AMR in recipients of heart allografts and possibly also in recipients of discordant xenografts in the future."
1710,The role of globalization in CO2 emissions: A semi-parametric panel data analysis for G7,"Liu, Mingming; Ren, Xiaohang; Cheng, Cheng; Wang, Zhen","In order to provide flexible and comprehensive results about the relationship between globalization and CO2 emissions for the G7 countries, we introduce the KOF globalization index into traditional Stochastic Impacts by Regression on Population, Affluence and Technology model, and conduct the empirical analysis by applying a semi-parametric panel fixed effects model. The data covering the period of 1970-2015 consists of CO2 emissions, KOF globalization index, renewable energy consumption and GDP. Our results indicate that the relationship between globalization and CO2 emissions are inverted U-sharped, which strongly support the Environmental Kuznets Curve hypothesis. Furthermore, an increase of economic output is associated with statistically significant growth in CO2 emissions. On the contrary, an increment of renewable energy consumption lowers CO2 emissions. Related policy proposals are then offered according to our empirical results. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

We also interviewed the CHWs to obtain demographic information and information about the challenges their communities face. Most referrals were for Healthcare Access (48.7%) and Economic Stability (38.3%), while Neighborhood and Built Environment (0.09%) was the least used referral in the Social Determinants of Health during the time under review. Community Health Workers also carried out 1367 and 565 Blood Pressure and Blood Sugar measurements respectively during the period. The Community Health workers were all women and their education ranged from High School graduate to Master's degree graduate and they served as Community Health Workers for time ranging from 1 to 8 years. We found their answers to the questions on the issue plaguing the community they serve to indicate empathy and understanding of the issues of low-income communities. Having CHWs working as part of the public health system to deliver health promotion and provide referrals for social determinants of health could serve as a model for improving health access and impacting Social Determinants of Health positively for low-income populations across the country."
1712,"Herbivore-induced plant volatiles, not natural enemies, mediate a positive indirect interaction between insect herbivores","E Frago,R Gols,R Schweiger,C Müller,M Dicke,H C J Godfray,E Frago,R Gols,R Schweiger,C Müller,M Dicke,H C J Godfray","Many insect herbivores engage in apparent competition whereby two species interact through shared natural enemies. Upon insect attack, plants release volatile blends that attract natural enemies, but whether these volatiles mediate apparent competition between herbivores is not yet known. We investigate the role of volatiles that are emitted by bean plants upon infestation by Acyrthosiphon pisum aphids on the population dynamics and fitness of Sitobion avenae aphids, and on wheat phloem sap metabolites. In a field experiment, the dynamics of S. avenae aphids on wheat were studied by crossing two treatments: exposure of aphid colonies to A. pisum-induced bean volatiles and exclusion of natural enemies. Glasshouse experiments and analyses of primary metabolites in wheat phloem exudates were performed to better understand the results from the field experiment. In the field, bean volatiles did not affect S. avenae dynamics or survival when aphids were exposed to natural enemies. When protected from them, however, volatiles led to larger aphid colonies. In agreement with this observation, in glasshouse experiments, aphid-induced bean volatiles increased the survival of S. avenae aphids on wheat plants, but not on an artificial diet. This suggests that volatiles may benefit S. avenae colonies via metabolic changes in wheat plants, although we did not find any effect on wheat phloem exudate composition. We report a potential case of associational susceptibility whereby plant volatiles weaken the defences of receiving plants, thus leading to increased herbivore performance."
1713,"An empirical nexus between economic growth, energy utilization, trade policy, and ecological footprint: a continent-wise comparison in upper-middle-income countries","Usman, Muhammad; Kousar, Rakhshanda; Yaseen, Muhammad Rizwan; Makhdum, Muhammad Sohail Amjad","This study investigates the causal connection between economic growth, foreign direct investment, primary and renewable energy utilization, trade openness, and ecological footprint for 33 upper-middle-income countries (UMICs) from Africa, Asia, Europe, and America during the period from 1994 to 2017. Initially, first- as well as second-generation panel unit root tests are applied to check the integration order after confirming the cross-sectional dependency and heterogeneity. Four different tests (FMOLS, DOLS, FGLS, and AMG) are applied to estimate the long-run elasticity, whereas Dumitrescu and Hurlin (D-H) non-causality test is used to test growth, conservation, and feedback hypothesis. Results show negative relationship of economic growth on ecological footprint in Africa and Europe; renewable energy utilization in Asia, Europe, and America; and trade openness in Asia. Moreover, the results revealed an adverse impact of trade openness on ecological footprint in case of Africa and America. Furthermore, the results of D-H panel non-causality test confirm the growth hypothesis for economic growth to ecological footprint in Africa, Asia, and Europe; foreign direct investment to ecological footprint in Africa and Asia; primary energy utilization to ecological footprint in Asia; renewable energy utilization to ecological footprint in America; and trade openness to ecological footprint in Africa, Asia, and America. Furthermore, the feedback hypothesis was confirmed between economic growth and ecological footprint in Asia and Europe; foreign direct investment and ecological footprint in Africa and Asia; renewable energy utilization and ecological footprint for America; and trade openness and ecological footprint for Asia and America. Finally, in context to efficient policy implications, it is suggested to associate the economic growth with clean energy and environment-friendly technologies by expanding the share of renewable energy in America and economic growth in Africa and Europe. Furthermore, Asian policy makers need to focus on foreign direct investment and trade openness by using green energy to overcome the environmental degradation. Impulsion with these findings, the central authorities of UMICs need to focus on more investments in environmental quality not only through foreign direct investment but also exchanging their clean energy technologies through trade policies such as tax exemption, feed-in tariffs, and subsidies. Government of these countries ought to upgrade the conventional capital which will ultimately improve the human lives by providing clean environment."

Based on a systematic literature review conducted on research papers published between 2015 and 2020, and on the case studies contained within them (19 papers), this analysis focuses on the innovation drivers and sustainability drivers identified within family businesses in tourism. This desk-based research has made it possible to highlight how variable sustainability is present, albeit in a limited fashion, within family businesses in tourism; at the same time, it also shows how innovative strategies contribute to sustainable development. From the analysis, the correlations between family businesses, family dynamics, sustainability practices, innovation drivers and case studies were analyzed. The results show the poor implementation of innovative strategies, and at the same time, the presence of other variables that guarantee the adoption of sustainable practices. Important research gaps are identified, and future research priorities are suggested. Furthermore, the article is based on a collection of non-exhaustive literary sources. The implications for both family businesses and sustainable development are discussed."
1715,Dynamic hydrogen production from PV & wind direct electricity supply - Modeling and techno-economic assessment,"Schnuelle, Christian; Wassermann, Timo; Fuhrlaender, David; Zondervan, Edwin","Renewable hydrogen from water electrolysis could contribute to the defossilization of various energy intensive sectors but continues to suffer from unfavorable economics. Attention is being paid to the direct supply of renewable electricity to electrolyzers; in particular from photovoltaic (PV) and wind units, whose fixed remuneration period has expired. However, detailed analysis of such operating strategies via modeling and simulation of the dynamic behavior of alkaline electrolysis (AEL) and polymer electrolyte membrane electrolysis (PEMEL) is lacking. In this work, an electrolyzer model is developed for both AEL and PEMEL and analyzed for PV and wind power input data sets from the region of northwest Germany. It is shown that key performance indicators (KPI) such as hydrogen production efficiency, electricity utilization rate, product output and net production costs are highly reliant on the shape of transient power input signals as well as the electrolyzers ability to cope with them. PEMEL technology generally has higher electricity utilization rates than AEL, while AEL still achieves relatively large hydrogen production quantities due to its higher efficiency. Thus, the better operational flexibility of PEMEL cannot generally be considered advantageous in terms of hydrogen production quantities - the same applies for economics. The most competitive hydrogen production costs were 4.33 (sic) per kg for the AEL technology with direct electricity supply from old wind farms, which no longer receive fixed remuneration.

This article presents an ethnography of touch in two industrial settings using fourth generation industrial robots (a Glass Factory and a Waste Management Center) to critically explore the social and sensorial implications of such technologies for workers. We attend to manifestations of dirt and danger as encountered through describing workers' sensory experiences and identity formation. The contribution of the article is two-fold. The first is analytical through the development of three ""filters"" to grasp the complexity of the social and sensorial dynamics of touch in situ while tracing dispersed mediating effects of the introduction of novel technologies. The second is empirical, teasing out themes embedded in the sociosensorial dynamics of touch that intersect with gender, ethnicity, and class and relate to the technological mediation of touch."
1717,Income Inequality and CO(2)Emissions in Developing Countries: The Moderating Role of Financial Instability,"Yang, Bo; Ali, Minhaj; Hashmi, Shujahat Haider; Shabir, Mohsin","This paper studies the effects of income inequality and financial instability on CO(2)emissions in the presence of fossil fuel energy, economic development, industrialization, and trade openness. Moreover, the present study is the first to examine the moderating role of financial instability between income inequality and CO(2)emissions. We utilized panel data of forty-seven developing countries for the period 1980-2016 by utilizing the stochastic impacts by regression on population, affluence, and technology (STIRPAT) model. The empirical outcomes in all models indicate that income inequality and industrialization significantly reduce environmental degradation, while fossil fuel, trade openness, and economic growth decrease the quality of the environment. However, financial instability (without interaction term) shows no significant link to environmental quality, whereas (with interaction term) it shows a significant negative effect on CO(2)emissions. In addition, the result of the interaction variable reveals that an increase in inequality, ceteris paribus, in combination with the rise in financial instability, is expected to increase pollution. Furthermore, there exists a bidirectional causal association among income inequality, financial instability, fossil fuel, trade openness, industrialization, economic growth, and the interaction variable with CO(2)emissions."
1718,Examining Effects of the COVID-19 National Lockdown on Ambient Air Quality Across Urban India,"Navinya, Chimurkar; Patidar, Girish; Phuleria, Harish C.","Lockdown seems the most effective way to prevent the spread of Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) as no vaccine is currently available in the market to cure it. Thus, India has enforced nation-wide lockdown from 25th March to lower the spread of this contagious virus and associated illness. This study aims to quantify the changes in pollution levels as well as meteorology during the 6-weeks COVID-19 lockdown over 17 cities of India for 5 major criteria pollutants using publicly available air quality data. Hourly averaged data is accessed from the air quality monitoring stations during the lockdown and immediate pre-lockdown periods and also corresponding data from the previous year (2019). During the lockdown, PM2.5, PM10, NO2, and CO reduced significantly with relatively small changes in meteorological conditions compared to the pre-lockdown period. The highest decline is observed over Ahmedabad (68%), Delhi (71%), Bangalore (87%), and Nagpur (63%) for PM2.5, PM10, NO2, and CO, respectively. The Northern region shows the highest decline for all the pollutants with most days below NAAQS during lockdown-86%, 68%, and 100% compared to 18%, 0%, and 38% in 2019 for PM2.5, PM10, and NO2, respectively. The smaller cities Dewas and Jorapokhar show lesser improvement with only 3% and 16% improvement in days under NAAQS for PM2.5. SO2 is the least affected pollutant with little improvement. The major decline is observed during 7-10 am and 7-10 pm hours of the day for PM2.5, PM10, NO2, and CO with more than 40% reduction. The meteorological changes are very small and heterogeneous over India showing a similar extent of changes compared to the previous year but the pollution levels have reduced significantly. Thus, the sharp decline in pollutant concentration during the similar to 6 weeks period national lockdown can be attributed to the reduced economic and transport activities."

1720,Driving force analysis of carbon emissions in China's building industry: 2000-2015,"He, Junhao; Yue, Qiang; Li, Yun; Zhao, Feng; Wang, Heming","China's building industry is the industry with the largest carbon emissions. In this study, Chinese buildings were divided into three categories: rural residential buildings, urban residential buildings and public buildings. The building steel stock was calculated, and the five contributing factors of China's building carbon emissions from 2000 to 2015 were analyzed by factor decomposition analysis and Logarithmic Mean Divisia Index (LMDI) model. They were energy intensity, energy emission coefficient, per capita building steel stock, economic output level and per capita Gross Domestic Product (GDP). This study found that China's building steel stock had increased from 1.32 billion tons in 2000 to 2.89 billion tons in 2015, and its building energy consumption had increased from 264 million tons of standard coal in 2000 to 868 million tons in 2015. The other four factors promoted to the growth of building carbon emissions except for the energy emission coefficient. The biggest contributing factor was the level of economic output, with an average annual contribution of CO2 of 1.146 billion tons. And the second biggest factor contributing was the per capita building steel stock. Therefore, China should focus on the impact of these two factors on building carbon emissions in future."

However, few studies have assessed on the effects and pathophysiological mechanisms of stress on TBI. In the current study, using a mouse model of moderate TBI, we investigated whether restraint stress (RS) regulates secondary neurodegeneration and neuronal cell death, which are commonly associated with neurological dysfunctions. Our data showed that RS significantly reduced body weight recovery, delayed the recovery of neurological functions (motor function, cognitive function and anxiety-like behavior) and exacerbated the brain lesion volume after moderate TBI. Immunofluorescence results indicated that moderate TBI-induced cell insults and blood-brain barrier leakage were aggravated by RS. Further Western blotting experiments showed that RS activated endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress excessively after moderate TBI and decreased the number of NeuN-positive cells, but increased the number of CHOP/NeuN-co-positive cells by performing immunostaining in the injured cortex after moderate TBI. Moreover, RS increased the ratios of CHOP/Aβ and CHOP/p-Tau co-positive cells in the injured cortex after moderate TBI. However, blocking ER stress with the classic ER stress inhibitor salubrinal remarkably decreased apoptosis and the levels of autophagy-related proteins in the mouse model of moderate TBI plus RS. Collectively, RS delays the recovery of neurological function and deteriorates morphological damage by excessively activating ER stress-mediated neurodegeneration, apoptosis and autophagy after moderate TBI. Thus, monitoring stress levels in patients recovering from non-severe TBI may merit consideration in the future."
1722,"Environmental degradation: The role of electricity consumption, economic growth and globalisation","Rahman, Mohammad Mafizur","This paper examines the effects of electricity consumption, economic growth and globalisation on the CO2 emissions of top 10 electricity consuming countries. Taking annual data from 1971 to 2013, a panel cointegration approach is adopted where Fully Modified Ordinary Least Squares (FMOLS) and Dynamic Ordinary Least Squares (DOLS) methods are used to examine the long-run effects. Dumitrescu and Hurlin causality test is used to explore the directions of causality between the variables of interest. The empirical results reveal that there is a long-term association among these variables; and electricity consumption and economic growth positively and significantly affect the CO2 emissions in these countries. In contrast, globalisation has significant negative impact on the CO2 emissions implying the improvement of environmental quality. The findings also confirm the existence of the Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) hypothesis, the bidirectional causalities between economic growth and CO2 emissions, between electricity consumption and CO2 emissions, and between globalisation and economic growth in the sample countries. A unidirectional causality from economic growth to electricity consumption, from electricity consumption to globalisation and from globalisation to CO2 emissions is also found. Policy guidelines are suggested in line of the findings."

This energy source in the Qiabuqia geothermal field of Northwest China is expected to generate electricity. In this study, we used the lab parameters and the GR1 well data from the Qiabuqia site to numerically investigate the reservoir stimulation and electricity generation from a three-horizontal-well EGS system created in the granitic reservoir at depth 3500-3700 m, and at an average temperature of 218 degrees C. Slickwater fracturing and the resulting reservoir scenarios for different expected conditions in the region were analyzed in order to find suitable fracturing strategies. We then proposed three optimized EGS scenarios and evaluated their economic and environmental benefits. Results indicate that EGS power generation significantly depends on the reservoir stimulation results. The potential 2.61-4.90 MW installed capacity and 433.72-913.05 GWh total power generation are expected to be realized if the well spacing of 300-500 m and the hot water circulation rate of 20-40 kg/s in a 20-year period are achieved via the slickwater fracturing treatment. The final production temperature can be maintained at approximately 200 degrees C, and the corresponding temperature drops less than 10%. Such a case of geothermal engineering is expected to result in a reduction in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of 0.15-1.1 Mt, and its levelized cost of energy (LCOE) is estimated at 0.047-0.066 $/kWh.

Neuroscientists have adopted several model organisms to study dominance hierarchies in the laboratory setting, including fish, reptiles, rodents and primates. We review recent literature across species that sheds light onto how the brain represents social rank to guide socially appropriate behaviour within a dominance hierarchy. First, we discuss how the brain responds to social status signals. Then, we discuss social approach and avoidance learning mechanisms that we propose could drive rank-appropriate behaviour. Lastly, we discuss how the brain represents memories of individuals (social memory) and how this may support the maintenance of unique individual relationships within a social group. This article is part of the theme issue 'The centennial of the pecking order: current state and future prospects for the study of dominance hierarchies'."
1725,Interactions of high-rate nitrate reduction and heavy metal mitigation in iron-carbon-based constructed wetlands for purifying contaminated groundwater,"Jia, Lixia; Liu, Hai; Kong, Qiang; Li, Ming; Wu, Shubiao; Wu, Haiming","Groundwater, as the most important drinking water source in arid regions of China, has been polluted seriously by accumulated nitrate and heavy metals. An economic alternative with capacity of simultaneous mitigation of nitrate and heavy metals is urgently needed. This study explored the incorporation of iron scraps and biochar into constructed wetlands (CWs) for enhancing purification performance and investigated interactions of effective nitrate reduction and heavy metals mitigation. The results showed that nitrate reduction performance could reach 87% in iron and carbon-based (Fe-C) CWs through Fe-C micro-electrolysis process, with lower nitrous oxide (N2O) emission (4.6-11.75 g m(-2) h(-1)) due to the complete denitrification process. Moreover, efficient heavy metals mitigation of 75-97% total chromium (Cr) and total lead (Pb) was obtained from Fe-C systems. However, the occurrence of heavy metals (Cr and Pb) in the influent posed an adverse impact on nitrate removal with the reduction rate of 19-43%. Biochemical characteristics of wetland plants indicated that the plants also suffered from the stress which induced from heavy metals. Overall, although the addition of iron and biochar in CWs enhanced nitrate and heavy metals removal in low carbon groundwater, further investigation is still needed to reveal the complex relationships between the removal of nitrate and heavy metals in CWs.

1726,Trials and Treatments for Vascular Brain Health: Risk Factor Modification and Cognitive Outcomes,"Miia Kivipelto,Katie Palmer,Tina D Hoang,Kristine Yaffe,Miia Kivipelto,Katie Palmer,Tina D Hoang,Kristine Yaffe","There is robust evidence linking vascular health to brain health, cognition, and dementia. In this article, we present evidence from trials of vascular risk factor treatment on cognitive outcomes. We summarize findings from randomized controlled trials of antihypertensives, lipid-lowering medications, diabetes treatments (including antidiabetic drugs versus placebo, and intensive versus standard glycemic control), and multidomain interventions (that target several domains simultaneously such as control of vascular and metabolic factors, nutrition, physical activity, and cognitive stimulation etc). We report that evidence on the efficacy of vascular risk reduction interventions is promising, but not yet conclusive, and several methodological limitations hamper interpretation. Evidence mainly comes from high-income countries and, as cognition and dementia have not been the primary outcomes of many trials, evaluation of cognitive changes have often been limited. As the cognitive aging process occurs over decades, it is unclear whether treatment during the late-life window is optimal for dementia prevention, yet older individuals have been the target of most trials thus far. Further, many trials have not been powered to explore interactions with modifiers such as age, race, and apolipoprotein E, even though sub-analyses from some trials indicate that the success of interventions differs depending on patient characteristics. Due to the complex multifactorial etiology of dementia, and variations in risk factors between individuals, multidomain interventions targeting several risk factors and mechanisms are likely to be needed and the long-term sustainability of preventive interventions will require personalized approaches that could be facilitated by digital health tools. This is especially relevant during the COVID-19 pandemic, where intervention strategies will need to be adapted to the new normal, when face-to-face engagement with participants is limited and public health measures may create changes in lifestyle that affect individuals' vascular risk profiles and subsequent risk of cognitive decline."
1727,Shared and unique affective abnormalities in schizotypy dimensions,"Jocelyn Lai,Madeline E Snyder,Kamalakannan So M Vijayakumar,Drew H Bailey,Elizabeth A Martin,Jocelyn Lai,Madeline E Snyder,Kamalakannan So M Vijayakumar,Drew H Bailey,Elizabeth A Martin","Attention to affect is theoretically a precursor to one's ideal affect (i.e., preference for feeling low- and high-arousal positive and negative affect) and emotion regulation (ER). In schizotypy, there have been mixed findings regarding abnormalities in attention to affect. At the same time, little is known about ideal affect in schizotypy or whether differences in ideal affect or ER difficulties in schizotypy are driven by attention to affect. Thus, this study aimed to identify shared and unique abnormalities in attention to affect, ideal affect, and ER difficulties in schizotypy, and to test whether attention to affect underlies differences in ideal affect and ER difficulties. Using groups of individuals with either extreme levels of social anhedonia (SocAnh; n = 181), extreme levels of perceptual aberrations/magical ideation (PerMag; n = 105), or individuals low on both (i.e., controls; n = 531), we tested group differences in attention to affect, ideal affect, and ER difficulties. Our findings suggest both shared and unique affective abnormalities; compared to controls, the SocAnh group paid the least attention to positive affect. Only PerMag had heightened attention to negative affect compared to controls. Additionally, we found unique abnormalities relating to ideal affect but mostly shared difficulties in ER in schizotypy. Abnormalities in ideal affect and ER remain largely consistent after accounting for attention to affect for PerMag, suggesting that attention to affect is not the primary mechanism driving these abnormalities. However, we found evidence that attention to affect underlies some SocAnh-control group differences in ideal affect and ER difficulties. Our work helps to clarify prior work and contributes to the understanding of shared and unique affective abnormalities in schizotypy. Future research may consider longitudinal approaches to test causal mechanisms of affective abnormalities in schizotypy."
1728,"Of Semiotics, the Marginalised and Laws During the Lockdown in India","Manwendra K Tiwari,Swati Singh Parmar,Manwendra K Tiwari,Swati Singh Parmar","On 24th March 2020, the first nationwide complete lockdown was announced by the Prime Minister of India for 21 days which was later extended to 31st May 2020. Consequently, thousands of migrant workers placed in big cities had no other option but to go back to their native villages. Their journeys back to villages- thousands of kilometres on bicycles or foot due to the non-availability of public transport amidst the travel ban- were driven by the compulsions of food and shelter. In one of many heart-wrenching incidents, sixteen laborers were run over by a freight train (all passenger trains in the wake of lockdown had been halted) while they were resting on the railway tracks. The images of the Roti (Indian bread) on the railway track strewn across were beamed on the national news channels, as a telling commentary of the unimaginable hardships of these workers. Ironically, in the eyes of law, they were trespassers under the Indian Railways Act, 1989. The Indian Railway did not pay any compensation to the victims. Their act also violated the Indian Disaster Management Act, 2005 and Indian Penal Code, 1860- the law for the breach of lockdown guidelines and the law for disobedience of order by public servants respectively- for having decided to travel amidst a travel ban. The semiotics of law-making acts 'criminal' bereft of 'moral culpability' are seldom questioned on their supposed amoral foundations. Pandemic exhibited that social fissures not only condition the individual or community actions but also the actions of the State. Minorities especially Muslims were at the receiving end of State's selective enforcement of lockdown laws in India. The various instances in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic expose the hollow claims of equality before the law and the equal protection of laws as a constitutional promise to every citizen. This article aims to unravel the ostensible and the actual moral exhibition of such Indian laws through the lens of several incidents during the nationwide lockdown in India. This paper would argue that this constructed positivist amorality needs to be deconstructed to unearth the power imbalance that it seeks to hide."
1729,Research on the impact of multi-dimensional urbanization on China's carbon emissions under the background of COP21,"Chen, Jian; Wang, Lingjun; Li, Yuanyuan","The Paris Agreement (COP21) further defines the concept of global climate governance as low-carbon green development. Urbanization and carbon emissions are two major characteristics of modern Chinese economic and social development. China's new urbanization requires not only the realization of population, the harmonization of land and economic urbanization also requires the protection of the ecological environment in the process of urbanization to achieve green and low-carbon development. Therefore, it is of great theoretical and practical significance to explore the influencing factors of carbon emissions and compare their differences based on spatial econometric models and from various perspectives of urbanization. Empirical findings of the study are as follows: (1) The Moran's I indexes are all above 0.5, the spatial effects of regional carbon emissions are significant, and it cannot be ignored. Similarly, it shows that the optimal model is a spatial doubly model with dual fixed effects. (2) Direct effects of population, land, and economic urbanization are positive. Whereas, indirect effect about population urbanization is negative, but its total effect is same direction change with carbon emissions. Indirect and total effect of land urbanization are negative, indirect effect of economic urbanization is small and total effect is significantly positive. (3) Per capita GDP, energy intensity, and environmental regulation variables of control variables are all positive; opening to outside be positive but not obvious."
1730,Thermodynamic analysis on the combination of supercritical carbon dioxide power cycle and transcritical carbon dioxide refrigeration cycle for the waste heat recovery of shipboard,"Yu, Aofang; Su, Wen; Lin, Xinxing; Zhou, Naijun; Zhao, Li","With excellent physical properties, carbon dioxide has been widely employed as a working fluid in efficient energy conversion technologies, which are represented by supercritical carbon dioxide Brayton cycle and transcritical carbon dioxide refrigeration cycle. In this contribution, with the aim to recover the waste heat of shipboard, a combined system coupling carbon dioxide Brayton cycle and refrigeration cycle is proposed to simultaneously produce power and cooling. In order to alleviate the temperature mismatch in recuperator and effectively utilize the discharged heat of refrigeration cycle, low temperature recuperator and gas cooler are shared by power and cooling cycles. For this novel waste heat recovery system, thermodynamic and economic models are developed to conduct energy, exergy and economic analysis. Thereafter, key cycle parameters including gas cooler pressure, evaporation temperature and turbine inlet temperature are investigated to reveal the effects on the system performances. The obtained results indicate that the energy and exergy efficiencies of the proposed system are respectively 42.42% and 39.05% under design conditions. The corresponding average energy cost is 9.28 $/GJ. At lower evaporation temperature and higher gas cooler pressure, the advantages of low temperature recuperator can be fully utilized and more work is produced. However, lower cooling capacity is obtained. Furthermore, the turbine inlet temperature has no effects on refrigeration cycle, and the net work decreases with the increase of inlet temperature. These results will be beneficial to improve the design and performance of combined power and cooling system for future shipboard applications."
1731,How to achieve green growth in China's agricultural sector,"Xu, Bin; Chen, Weitao; Zhang, Guijun; Wang, Jiahui; Ping, Weiying; Luo, Liangqing; Chen, Jianbao","Green development is the direction of China's agricultural sector. Investigating the main influencing factors of the agricultural sector's CO2 emissions will help plan agricultural development and achieve low-carbon growth. This paper selects 2001-2016 panel data of China's 30 provinces, and uses the nonparametric additive regression models to investigate the agricultural sector's CO2 emissions. The empirical results show that economic growth, financial capacity, and energy intensity all have a ""pull first, then restrict"" inverted U-shaped nonlinear effect on CO2 emissions. However, the influencing mechanisms of these three influencing factors are different and need to be paid attention by relevant government departments. More complicated, the impact of urbanization on CO2 emission shows a gentle ""M-shaped"" pattern. In addition, an inverse ""N-shaped"" nonlinear link exists between trade openness and CO2 emissions. Therefore, government departments should formulate differentiated emission reduction policies at different stages. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."

Aggrecan deficiency, due to heterozygous mutations in the ACAN gene, causes dominantly inherited short stature and, in many patients, early-onset osteoarthritis and degenerative disc disease. We aimed to further characterize this phenotypic spectrum with an emphasis on musculoskeletal health. Twenty-two individuals from nine families were enrolled. Histories and examinations focused on joint health, gait analysis, joint specific patient reported outcomes, and imaging studies were performed. All patients had dominantly inherited short stature, with the exception of a de novo mutation. Short stature was worse in adults versus children (median height -3.05 SD vs. -2.25 SD). ACAN mutations were not always associated with bone age advancement (median advancement +1.1 years, range 0 to +2 years). Children had subtle disproportionality and clinically silent joint disease-25% with osteochondritis dissecans (OD). Adults had a high prevalence of joint symptomatology-decline in knee function, disability from spinal complaints, and lower physical activity on outcome measures. Osteoarthritis (OA) and OD was detected in 90% of adults, and orthopedic surgeries were reported in 60%. Aggrecan deficiency leads to short stature with progressive decline in height SD, mild skeletal dysplasia, and increasing prevalence of joint pathology over time. Optimal musculoskeletal health and quality of life can be attained with timely identification of pathology and intervention."

Our objective is to describe unusual presentations of JCV infection to heighten clinician awareness. We describe three case reports of various PML presentations. Firstly a 56-year-old HIV positive male with decades of viral suppression and normal immune function presented with 1 month of non-specific headache that spontaneously resolved despite an MRI showing a new area of PML and CSF being JC DNA + . He had had two similar episodes in 2013 and 2014 with MRI scans consistent with PML, CSF, JCV, and PCR positivity once and brain biopsy-positive twice. Another 61-year-old male presented with subacute binocular vision loss and was found to have newly diagnosed HIV and JCV DNA detected in CSF. MRI brain only demonstrated symmetrical chiasmo-hypothalamic enhancement. There has been some improvement with combination antiretroviral therapy and corticosteroids for immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS). Thirdly, a 65-year-old male presented with subacute progressive confusion and behavioural disturbance, one year post-bilateral lung transplantation. MRI brain demonstrated no evidence of PML but CSF on three occasions demonstrated a progressively increasing JCV DNA load. Despite reduction in his immunosuppression, the patient developed profound encephalopathy without localising features leading to death two months later. These cases emphasise the atypical presentations of JCV: chronic relapsing, unusual symmetrical visual pathway disease, and non-localising encephalopathy without MRI evidence of PML."
1734,Compressive strength prediction of eco-efficient GGBS-based geopolymer concrete using GEP method,"Shahmansouri, Amir Ali; Bengar, Habib Akbarzadeh; Ghanbari, Saeed","Geopolymer concrete (GPC) could be used as an environmental-friendly alternative solution for concrete production due to the detrimental impacts of cement production on the environment. Since obtaining an optimal mix design, and subsequently, predicting the compressive strength of mortar using experimental means is costly and time-consuming, employing soft-computing techniques could facilitate and accelerate this approach. In this research, gene expression programming (GEP) was used to develop numerical models for predicting the compressive strength of GPC based on ground granulated blast-furnace slag (GGBS). Through an experimental program, an extensive database of the compressive strength of GGBS-based GPC consisting of 351 specimens obtained from 117 different mixtures was generated. The five most effective parameters, including specimen age, sodium hydroxide (NaOH) solution concentration, natural zeolite (NZ), silica fume (SF), and GGBS content, were considered as the modeling input parameters. Using GEP algorithm, simplified and practical mathematical equations were proposed to predict the compressive strength of GGBS-based GPC mortar. Performance, high accuracy, and predictability of the proposed equations were validated by the conducted sensitivity and parametric analyses. The obtained results could promote the re-use of GGBS for GPC development, which in turn will lead to environmental and economic advantages."

In the wake of the pandemic, travel patterns of individuals change as well. Understanding the changes in biking behaviors during evolving COVID-19 situations is a primary goal of this paper. It investigated usage patterns of the bike-share system in Singapore before, during, and after local authorities imposed lockdown measures. It also correlated the centrality attributes of biking mobility networks of different timestamps with land-use conditions. The results show that total ridership surprisingly climbed by 150% during the lockdown, compared with the pre-pandemic level. Biking mobility graphs became more locally clustered and polycentric as the epidemic develop. There existed a positive and sustained spatial autocorrelation between centrality measures and regions with high residential densities or levels of the land-use mixture. This study suggests that bike-share systems may serve as an alternative mode to fulfill mobility needs when public transit services are restricted due to lockdown policies. Shared-micromobility services have the potential to facilitate a disease-resilient transport system as societies may have to coexist with COVID in the future."
1736,Key factors influencing public awareness of household solid waste recycling in urban areas of China: A case study,"Wang, Hui; Liu, Xiao; Wang, Ning; Zhang, Kun; Wang, Fengchuan; Zhang, Shuping; Wang, Renqing; Zheng, Peiming; Matsushita, Michinari","With rapid economic development, population growth, and urbanization, household solid waste (HSW) causes significant environmental pollution and health threats to residents. As the sustainable waste management, HSW recycling is an urgent requirement in China and other countries. However, public awareness of HSW recycling and its influencing factors were seldom systematically analyzed in China. In present study, an on-site face-to-face questionnaire survey was the main research tool. We investigate public awareness of HSW recycling in typical Chinese cities, including public behavior, recycling knowledge, and public willingness to participate. The factors influencing public awareness were also explored. We found that public awareness was inadequate regarding HSW treatment behavior and recycling knowledge. Age is the most important sociodemographic factor influencing the public awareness of HSW recycling. White collar, residents with higher educational attainment, and those aged 20-50 years displayed less environmentally responsible behavior with regard to HSW treatment. Manual workers, those with lower educational attainment, those with higher monthly income, and older people tend to have poorer HSW recycling knowledge. White collar workers, those with higher educational attainment, and those with lower monthly income were less willing to participate in HSW recycling. Accordingly, measurements conducted amongst specific demographic categories are proposed to improve public awareness of HSW recycling. The scientific information provided by this study may contribute to HSW recycling especially from a public awareness perspective."

Perylenebisimide (PBI) chromophore tagged fluorescent ABC-triblock polycaprolactone (PCL) nanoscaffold was engineered having carboxylic acid blocks for the chemical conjugation of cisplatin at the core and hydrophilic PEG blocks at the periphery. The amphiphilic ABC triblock Pt-prodrug was self-assembled into <200 nm nanoparticles and exhibited excellent shielding against drug detoxification by the glutathione (GSH) species in the cytosol. In vitro drug release studies confirmed that the Pt-prodrug was stable at extracellular conditions and the PCL block exclusively underwent lysosomal-enzymatic biodegradation at the intracellular level to release the cisplatin drug in the active-form for accomplishing more than 90% cell growth inhibition. Confocal microscopic imaging of the red-fluorescence signals from the perylene chromophores established the simultaneous monitoring and delivery aspects of the Pt-prodrug, and the proof-of-concept was successfully demonstrated in breast and cervical cancer cell lines."

1739,Vehicle routing problem in cold Chain logistics: A joint distribution model with carbon trading mechanisms,"Liu, Guike; Hu, Jiayao; Yang, Yu; Xia, Senmao; Lim, Ming Kim","Fierce competition and the mandate for green development have driven cold chain logistics companies to minimize total distribution costs and carbon emissions to gain a competitive advantage and achieve sustainable development. However, the cold chain logistics literature considers carbon trading mechanisms in sharing economy, namely the joint distribution, is limited. Our research builds a Joint Distribution-Green Vehicle Routing Problem (JD-GVRP) model, in which cold chain logistics companies collaborate among each other to deliver cold chain commodities by considering carbon tax policy. Based on the real business data from four cold chain companies and 28 customers, a simulated annealing (SA) algorithm is applied to optimize the model. The results indicate that joint distribution is an effective way to reduce total costs and carbon emissions when compared with the single distribution. The total cost is positively correlated with the carbon price, while the carbon emissions vary differently when the carbon price increases. In addition, carbon quotas have no effect on the delivery path. This research expands cold chain logistics literature by linking it with joint distribution and carbon trading mechanisms. Moreover, this research suggests that cold chain logistics companies could enhance delivery efficiency, reduce the business cost, and improve competitiveness by reinforcing the collaboration at the industry level. Furthermore, the government should advocate the mode of joint distribution and formulate an effective carbon trading policy to better utilize social and industrial resources to achieve the balanced economic and environmental benefits."
1740,"Combining climate, economic, and social policy builds public support for climate action in the US","Bergquist, Parrish; Mildenberger, Matto; Stokes, Leah C.","Despite the gravity of the climate threat, governments around the world have struggled to pass and implement climate policies. Today, politicians and advocates are championing a new idea: linking climate policy to other economic and social reforms. Will this approach generate greater public support for climate action? Here, we test this coalition-building strategy. Using two conjoint experiments on a representative sample of 2,476 Americans, we evaluate the marginal impact of 40 different climate, social, and economic policies on support for climate reforms. Overall, we find climate policy bundles that include social and economic reforms such as affordable housing, a $15 minimum wage, or a job guarantee increase US public support for climate mitigation. Clean energy standards, regardless of which technologies are included, also make climate policy more popular. Linking climate policy to economic and social issues is particularly effective at expanding climate policy support among people of color."
1741,Targets for a circular economy,"Morseletto, Piero","The transition to a circular economy requires actions and policies. In the praxis of governance, a common way to steer the transition to a different state proceeds through the setting of targets. Thus far, no study has investigated circular economy targets in a systematic way. To bridge this gap, this study examines which targets can facilitate the transition towards a circular economy. The analysis focuses both on existing and new targets; the latter complement existing targets which are limited to a few discrete cases addressing only partially the goal of a more circular economy. A framework based on 10 common circular economy strategies (i.e. recover, recycling, repurpose, remanufacture, refurbish, repair, re-use, reduce, rethink, refuse) is applied to scrutinise the selected targets. The study clarifies that existing targets for recovery and recycling do not necessarily promote a circular economy, though they are the most commonly applied targets so far. Because of lack of efficacy of recovery and recycling, targets should instead favour other more powerful circular economy strategies. In relation to these, the study looks into new and existing targets showing how they can reduce waste, increase efficiency, close production loops, and maximise retention of the economic value of materials and products. In particular, the study proposes an expanded set of brand new targets for the transition to a circular economy together with a fresh view on targets aimed at scholars and decision-makers alike."

As a high infectious pathogen, the existence of SARS-CoV-2 in public space is very important for its transmission. During the COVID-19 pandemic, hospitals are the main places to deal with the diseases. In this work, we evaluated the exposure risk of SARS-CoV-2 in hospital environment in order to protect healthcare workers (HCWs). Briefly, air and surface samples from 6 different sites of 3 hospitals with different protection levels were collected and tested for the SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid by reverse transcription real-time fluorescence PCR method during the COVID-19 epidemic. We found that the positive rate of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid was 7.7 % in a COVID-19 respiratory investigation wards and 82.6 % in a ICUs with confirmed COVID-19 patients. These results indicated that in some wards of the hospital, such as ICUs occupied by COVID-19 patients, the nucleic acid of SARS-CoV-2 existed in the air and surface, which indicates the potential occupational exposure risk of HCWs. This study has clarified retention of SARS-CoV-2 in different sites of hospital, suggesting that it is necessary to monitor and disinfect the SARS-CoV-2 in hospital environment during COVID-19 pandemic, and will help to prevent the iatrogenic infection and nosocomial transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and to better protect the HCWs."

Effective management of the emotional and psychosocial effects of the pandemic is a critical issue for individuals and societies. In this study, the mediating role of creativity on the relationship between personal accomplishment and task performance was examined during the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, a gender-based comparison analysis was performed to extend the analysis results. Survey-based research data were collected from 322 people working in different sectors. Partial least squares-based structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) was used to analyze research data. The results indicated that personal accomplishment had a significant positive effect on both creativity and task performance. Also, it was found that creativity had a mediating role in the relationship between personal accomplishment and task performance. Lastly, the gender-based multigroup analysis (MGA) revealed a significant difference between male and female participants with respect to the relationship between personal accomplishment and task performance, between creativity and task performance, between personal accomplishment and task performance through creativity."
1746,Sustainable supplier selection: A novel integrated fuzzy best worst method (F-BWM) and fuzzy CoCoSo with Bonferroni (CoCoSo'B) multi-criteria model,"Ecer, Fatih; Pamucar, Dragan","In sustainable supply chain management (SSCM), triple bottom line (TBL) of sustainability (economic, social, and environmental) are considered when selecting the suppliers. In this paper, the relative weights of SSCM practices are extracted by fuzzy best worst method (F-BWM) which is capable of better modeling of human thinking. Afterwards, the traditional Combined Compromise Solution (CoCoSo) method is enhanced by the integration of the normalized weighted and the normalized weighted geometric Bonferroni mean functions to select the most proper supplier in a supply chain. The integration of the Bonferroni functions into the CoCoSo method (CoCoSo'B) enables: (1) flexible decision-making respecting the interaction between decision attributes; (2) the elimination of the influence of extreme/awkward data on the values of the criterion functions, and (3) checking the robustness of the results through a variation of the parameters lambda, p, and q. Testing the model on the example of sustainable supplier selection demonstrates the rationality, objectivity, flexibility, and stability of the results of the proposed model. Further, the proposed framework makes it possible to evaluate suppliers in terms of sustainability in spite of ambiguities in the decision-making process and a lack of quantitative information. Finally, a real world example of home appliance manufacturer in Serbia is discussed to verify the proposed model applicability. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."

In Zn-air batteries, the membrane allows the transport of OH- ions between the air electrode and the Zn electrode while providing a physical barrier between the two electrodes in order to prevent electrical short circuits. The performance of this battery is greatly affected by the physicochemical properties of the employed membrane. However, the development of appropriate membranes has received insufficient attention. In this paper, an overview of recent developments and a critical discussion of the state-of-the-art studies focusing on membranes for Zn-air batteries are provided. The membranes are classified in seven categories, which are discussed in light of their structure, properties and performances in Zn-air battery. Moreover, membrane synthesis and modification strategies to minimize the crossover of zincate ions and formation/growth of Zn-dendrites are presented. Finally, the remaining key challenges related to the membranes and the most promising future research directions are provided. The main objective of this work is to provide guidance for researchers and industries for the selection and development of appropriate membranes with the ultimate goal of commercializing rechargeable Zn-air batteries."
1748,"Flexible environmental policy, technological innovation and sustainable development of China's industry: The moderating effect of environment regulatory enforcement","Yuan, Baolong; Zhang, Yang","How to rely on market mechanism for achieving industrial sustainable development is an important issue both to current scholars and policymakers. Technological innovation is regarded as a mediator to construct a driving mechanism that flexible environmental policy affects sustainable development from the ""narrow"" perspective of Porter's hypothesis. Meanwhile, environment regulatory enforcement is introduced as a moderator to explore the institutional scenario that drives sustainable development of China's industry. Then we have adopted industrial panel data of 30 provinces in 2006-2015 and employed the sys-GMM method for empirical test. The findings show that: (1) flexible environmental policy can significantly facilitate industrial sustainable development. (2) Flexible environmental policy has a significantly positive impact on technological innovation. Meanwhile, technological innovation is significantly and positively related to industrial sustainable development, and technological innovation partially mediates the relationship between flexible environmental policy and industrial sustainable development. (3) Environment regulatory enforcement positively moderates the relationship between flexible environmental policy and technological innovation. However, it has a potentially positive but not significant moderating impact on the relationship between technological innovation and industrial sustainable development, indicating that there is still an ""implementation gap"". (4) From a regional point of view, technological innovation has partly mediating effects between flexible environmental policy and industrial sustainable development in the eastern and western regions, and environmental regulatory enforcement can positively moderate the role of flexible environmental policy in promoting technological innovation in the eastern region. Finally, this paper puts forward the policy implications. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."
1749,Autophagy mediates the clearance of oligodendroglial SNCA/alpha-synuclein and TPPP/p25A in multiple system atrophy models,"Panagiota Mavroeidi,Fedra Arvanitaki,Maria Vetsi,Stefan Becker,Dimitrios Vlachakis,Poul Henning Jensen,Leonidas Stefanis,Maria Xilouri,Panagiota Mavroeidi,Fedra Arvanitaki,Maria Vetsi,Stefan Becker,Dimitrios Vlachakis,Poul Henning Jensen,Leonidas Stefanis,Maria Xilouri","Accumulation of the neuronal protein SNCA/alpha-synuclein and of the oligodendroglial phosphoprotein TPPP/p25A within the glial cytoplasmic inclusions (GCIs) represents the key histophathological hallmark of multiple system atrophy (MSA). Even though the levels/distribution of both oligodendroglial SNCA and TPPP/p25A proteins are critical for disease pathogenesis, the proteolytic mechanisms involved in their turnover in health and disease remain poorly understood. Herein, by pharmacological and molecular modulation of the autophagy-lysosome pathway (ALP) and the proteasome we demonstrate that the endogenous oligodendroglial SNCA and TPPP/p25A are degraded mainly by the ALP in murine primary oligodendrocytes and oligodendroglial cell lines under basal conditions. We also identify a KFERQ-like motif in the TPPP/p25A sequence that enables its effective degradation via chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA) in an in vitro system of rat brain lysosomes. Furthermore, in a MSA-like setting established by addition of human recombinant SNCA pre-formed fibrils (PFFs) as seeds of pathological SNCA, we thoroughly characterize the contribution of CMA and macroautophagy in particular, in the removal of the exogenously added and the seeded oligodendroglial SNCA pathological assemblies. We also show that PFF treatment impairs autophagic flux and that TPPP/p25A exerts an inhibitory effect on macroautophagy, while at the same time CMA is upregulated to remove the pathological SNCA species formed within oligodendrocytes. Finally, augmentation of CMA or macroautophagy accelerates the removal of the engendered pathological SNCA conformations further suggesting that autophagy targeting may represent a successful approach for the clearance of pathological SNCA and/or TPPP/p25A in the context of MSA.Abbreviations: 3MA: 3-methyladenine; ACTB: actin, beta; ALP: autophagy-lysosome pathway; ATG5: autophagy related 5; AR7: atypical retinoid 7; CMA: chaperone-mediated autophagy; CMV: cytomegalovirus; CTSD: cathepsin D; DAPI: 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; DMEM: Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; Epox: epoxomicin; GAPDH: glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; GCIs: glial cytoplasmic inclusions; GFP: green fluorescent protein; HMW: high molecular weight; h: hours; HSPA8/HSC70: heat shock protein 8; LAMP1: lysosomal-associated membrane protein 1; LAMP2A: lysosomal-associated membrane protein 2A; MAP1LC3/LC3: microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3; mcherry: monomeric cherry; MFI: mean fluorescence intensity; mRFP: monomeric red fluorescent protein; MSA: multiple system atrophy; OLN: oligodendrocytes; OPCs: oligodendroglial progenitor cells; PBS: phosphate-buffered saline; PC12: pheochromocytoma cell line; PD: Parkinson disease; PFFs: pre-formed fibrils; PIs: protease inhibitors; PSMB5: proteasome (prosome, macropain) subunit, beta type 5; Rap: rapamycin; RFP: red fluorescent protein; Scr: scrambled; SDS: sodium dodecyl sulfate; SE: standard error; siRNAs: small interfering RNAs; SNCA: synuclein, alpha; SQSTM1: sequestosome 1; TPPP: tubulin polymerization promoting protein; TUBA: tubulin, alpha; UPS: ubiquitin-proteasome system; WT: wild type."
1750,Procyanidin A1 alleviates DSS-induced ulcerative colitis via regulating AMPK/mTOR/p70S6K-mediated autophagy,"Haihua Zhang,Wuying Lang,Xin Liu,Jiangsong Bai,Qinghui Jia,Qiumei Shi,Haihua Zhang,Wuying Lang,Xin Liu,Jiangsong Bai,Qinghui Jia,Qiumei Shi","Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a recurrent chronic inflammatory disease. The symptom of UC is mainly diarrhea including bloody stools. Increasing evidence has suggested that procyanidin A1 (PCA1) exerts an anti-inflammatory effect in several diseases. However, the role of PCA1 in UC is still a mystery. In our study, we explored the effect of PCA1 in dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced UC mice and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated HT-29 and IEC-6 cells. Then, cell proliferation, apoptosis, the production of proinflammatory cytokines, and autophagy-related markers were determined. Furthermore, the AMPK/mTOR/p70S6K signaling pathway was assayed by Western blot assay. In in vivo study, we found that PCA1 administration alleviated DSS-induced UC, as evidenced by reducing weight loss, clinical scores, colon weight/length ratio, histological damage, proinflammatory cytokines, and apoptosis. Moreover, we showed that the expression of Beclin-1 and LC3II/I ratio was increased, whereas the level of p62 was decreased after PCA1 treatment in vivo. Meanwhile, the reduced AMP/ATP ratio, enhanced expression of p-AMPK, and decreased p-p70S6K and p-mTOR levels indicate the activation of AMPK/mTOR/p70S6K signaling pathway. In in vitro study, PCA1 promoted cell proliferation and inhibited cell apoptosis in LPS-stimulated HT-29 and IEC-6 cells. Pro-inflammatory cytokines and autophagy-related factors exhibited the same trend as in in vivo results. Mechanically, PCA1 activated the AMPK/mTOR/p70S6K signaling pathway. The treatment with an AMPK inhibitor compound C significantly reversed the anti-inflammatory effect of PCA1 in LPS-stimulated cells. Taken together, these data indicated that PCA1 alleviated UC through induction of AMPK/mTOR/p70S6K-mediated autophagy."
1751,Study on the interactive influence between economic growth and environmental pollution,"Rao, Congjun; Yan, Bangjie","With the rapid growth of economy, the environmental pollution problem is becoming increasingly prominent. How to promote the coordinated and balanced development of economy and environment is a strategic problem of great significance that we face urgently. Taking Wuhan City of China as the research object, this paper selects the key indexes of economic growth and environmental pollution and studies the interactive influence between economic growth and environmental pollution in Wuhan. On the one hand, the impact of Wuhan's economic growth on environmental pollution is analyzed by the proposed time-delay correlation analysis method and the time-delay EKC (Environment Kuznets Curve) models. On the other hand, the impact of Wuhan's environmental pollution on environmental growth is studied. By establishing the LARS-LASSO (least angle regression-least absolute shrinkage and selection operator) regression model and the stepwise regression model, the main factors affecting economic growth in preliminary environmental pollution indexes are analyzed, and then, an interaction model is established to study the impact of the interaction between any two main environmental factors on economic growth. The results of empirical analysis show that the main factors affecting economic growth are industrial wastewater emissions, industrial waste gas emissions, and industrial smoke and dust emissions, and the interaction between industrial waste gas emissions and industrial wastewater emissions restrains economic growth."
1752,"Site selection of wind farms using GIS and multi-criteria decision making method in Wafangdian, China","Xu, Ye; Li, Ye; Zheng, Lijun; Cui, Liang; Li, Sha; Li, Wei; Cai, Yanpeng","Site selection is one of the most significant decision making activities for development of wind energy resource. In this study, a novel method integrating Geographic Information System (GIS), interval Analytic Hierarchy Process (IAHP) and stochastic VIKOR was proposed to tackle site selection issue of wind farms in the Wafangdian region, China. Two major factors, i.e. biodiversity conservation and production safety, were utilized to determine feasible areas. Afterwards, the weight of evaluation criteria, including the social impact, economic benefit, terrain and eco-environment protection, were identified by using IAHP. Finally, the suitability indexes of various alternatives were calculated by stochastic VIKOR and their ranking was used to determine high-suitability areas for wind farm locations. The obtained results indicated that 30.2% of studied region were suitable for installing the wind-power facilities, but only 3.36% were determined to be highly suitable. By comparing the optimized results to the actual locations of existing wind farms, it was revealed that the ideological framework of this study were practical and effective in guiding site selection of wind farms, and they were also useful for applications in site selection of other renewable energy forms involving complex spatial analysis and multiple criteria evaluation, including solar, hydroelectric, geothermal and biomass.

However, the design of such a device has been impeded by sluggish kinetics of its half reactions, i.e., cathodic N2 reduction reaction (NRR) and anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Here, it is predicted from density function theory that high-entropy oxides (HEOs) are potential catalysts for promoting NRR and OER, and subsequently develop a facile procedure to synthesize HEOs in the morphology of sea urchin-shaped hollow nanospheres assembled from ultrathin nanosheets. The excellent electrocatalytic activities of HEOs for both NRR (NH3 yield rate: 47.58 µg h-1 mg-1 and Faradaic efficiency (FE): 10.74%) and OER (215 mV @10 mA cm-2 ) are demonstrated. Consequently, a prototype device of N2 electrolysis driven by commercial batteries is constructed, which can operate smoothly and deliver remarkable NH3 yield rate (41.11 µg h-1 mg-1 ) and FE (14.14%). Further mechanism study has attributed the excellent catalytic performances of HEOs to their unique electronic structures originated from multi-metal synergistic effects and entropy increase effects. The work will provide new clues for designing versatile catalysts and devices for large-scale industrialization."

This paper aims to provide entrepreneurship insights, implementations and dynamics to demonstrate the role of entrepreneurship in times of such adversity within an Australian context. We provide emergent enquiry narratives from leading Australian scholars, identifying entrepreneurial initiatives as a catalyst to new venture creation and growth. Narratives include insights associated with the entrepreneurial mindset, the multidimensional effects of resilience and entrepreneurship, entrepreneurship education, entrepreneurship enablers and the entrepreneurial ecosystem. Opportunities for further research are identified, particularly regarding context and empirical outcomes. We postulate that entrepreneurship may well be the unsung hero during the current COVID-19 economic crisis."
1755,Does electricity consumption and globalization increase pollutant emissions? Implications for environmental sustainability target for China,"Saint Akadiri, Seyi; Alola, Andrew Adewale; Bekun, Festus Victor; Etokakpan, Mfonobong Udom","Giving that People's Republic of China is one of the two new frontiers of globalization, the country has continued to contend with the bottleneck of sustaining its economic growth amidst environmental hiccups arising from the drawbacks of globalization and energy consumption. By investigating the challenges of the country's drive toward environmental sustainability, the present study offers a new perspective on the role of electricity consumption and economic growth in a carbon-income function setting. This study also incorporates globalization into CO2 emissions equation for the experimental period of 1970-2014. Stationarity properties were ascertained by the Zivot and Andrew unit root test under a single structural break. Subsequently, the recent and novel combined cointegration test of Bayer and Hanck (2013) in conjunction with the Pesaran bounds testing approach is used to establish a cointegration relationship among the selected variables. Finally, the modified Wald test of the Toda-Yamamoto Granger causality test is employed to detect the direction of causality flows among the variables. Empirical piece of evidence finds a statistically positive correlation between electricity consumption and economic growth as seen in the long-run regression. This result is also affirmed by the Granger causality test. The test corroborates with the electricity-induced growth hypothesis in the case of China. However, there is an environmental trade-off, as more electricity consumptions spur increased carbon dioxide emissions (CO2). Our study finds empirical support that globalization reduced pollutant emissions in both the short and long run over our sampled period. Based on these results and outcomes, several policy prescriptions on the energy-income and environment nexus are renders for policymakers. Among such policy recommendations are (a) the need for the diversification of the Chinese energy mix to cleaner energy sources and renewables and (b) the need for decarbonization and adoption of carbon capturing and storage technologies."
1756,Industry 4.0 sustainable supply chains: An application of an IoT enabled scrap metal management solution,"Mastos, Theofilos D.; Nizamis, Alexandros; Vafeiadis, Thanasis; Alexopoulos, Nikolaos; Ntinas, Christos; Gkortzis, Dimitrios; Papadopoulos, Angelos; Ioannidis, Dimosthenis; Tzovaras, Dimitrios","The fourth industrial revolution and the digitisation of supply chains have led companies to realize that the adoption of Industry 4.0/Internet of Things (IoT) solutions creates opportunities for more sustainable management. The sustainable management of scrap metal is a challenging task for all the organisations that participate in the supply chain and especially for scrap metal producers and waste management companies. Although metals are considered to be infinitely recycled, scrap metal management is often inefficient due to several factors including collection processes, communication and marketplace limitations, which have significant environmental and economic impacts. The purpose of this paper is to provide evidence of the impact of an IoT solution on the sustainable supply chain management (SSCM) performance. A case study from a scrap metal producer that operates in the lift industry and a waste management company is presented, in order to illustrate how the deployment of a state-of-the-art industry 4.0 solution has the potential to improve sustainability both in the firm level and in the supply chain level. Direct benefits of the introduced solution are the automation of monitoring and negotiation procedures for the produced scrap metal. Indirectly, the proposed solution is beneficial in terms of CO2 emissions' reduction, resources availability and response time optimization. The results validate the framework for assessing SSCM for Industry 4.0 developed by Manavalan and Jayakrishna (2019) and demonstrate that Industry 4.0 solutions have the potential to improve, among others, the economic, environmental and social sustainability in supply chain management. The present study contributes to the literature by bridging the gap between theoretical developments and real-world cases in the fields of industry 4.0 and SSCM. Managerial implications, limitations and future research opportunities are also provided. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."

This study aimed to evaluate patients with postacute COVID-19 over 12 weeks of follow-up. The study included 151 patients who were diagnosed with COVID-19 by real-time polymerase chain reaction of a nasopharyngeal swab 1 month earlier, had radiologic findings consistent with COVID-19 pneumonia, and presented to the post-COVID-19 outpatient clinic between May and August 2021. The patients were divided into three groups based on COVID-19 severity: nonsevere pneumonia (Group 1), severe pneumonia (Group 2), and severe pneumonia requiring intensive care (Group 3). Evaluation of laboratory parameters at 4 and 12 weeks showed that Group 3 had a higher lactose dehydrogenase (LDH) level and a lower mean platelet volume than the other groups at both time points (p = 0.001 for all). Group 3 also had lower percent predicted forced vital capacity (FVC%), percent predicted forced expiration volume in 1 s (FEV1%), and percent predicted diffusion capacity of the lungs for carbon monoxide divided by alveolar volume (DLCO/VA%) compared to Groups 1 and 2 at Week 4 (p = 0.001, 0.004, 0.001, respectively) and compared to Group 1 at 12 weeks (p = 0.002, 0.03, 0.001, respectively). Patients with persistent dyspnea at 12 weeks had significantly lower FEV1%, FVC%, DLCO/VA%, and saturation levels in room air and significantly higher LDH, pro-BNP, D-dimer, and heart rate compared to those without dyspnea (p = 0.001 for all). Although the lungs are most commonly affected after COVID-19 infection, vascular and endothelial damage also causes multisystem involvement. Our study indicates that laboratory values, radiological signs, and pulmonary functional capacity improved in most patients after 12 weeks of follow-up."
1758,Zero-waste approach in municipal solid waste incineration: Reuse of bottom ash to stabilize fly ash,"Assi, Ahmad; Bilo, Fabjola; Zanoletti, Alessandra; Ponti, Jessica; Valsesia, Andrea; La Spina, Rita; Zacco, Annalisa; Bontempi, Elza","In this paper a simple method for all waste recovery through municipal solid waste incineration (MSWI) is presented. For the first time, MSWI fly ash (FA) is treated using MSWI bottom ash (BA), which is considered as a new urban mining source due to its pozzolanic characteristics. The proposed technology involves mixing these ashes with two other components: flue gas desulphurization residue and coal fly ash. Thermal annealing at a low temperature (120 degrees C for 4 h) can also be performed, to accelerate some reactions, but it is not necessary for stabilization. The efficacy of the process is demonstrated by the comparison of elemental concentrations in leaching solutions that are detected in the untreated ashes and the obtained stabilized materials, which show the reduced solubility of leachable Zn and Pb (with respect to the starting MSWI FA). The chemical, morphological, and structural characterization of the obtained materials makes it possible to propose and discuss a stabilization mechanism, which was attributed to carbonation and formation of calcium silicate hydrate (C-S-H). In particular, for the stabilized sample, X-ray Diffraction analysis confirmed the formation of calcite, whereas the sample morphology shows some fibrils that may be due to amorphous C-S-H with a Ca/Si ratio that is slightly smaller than 1.5. Because the proposed method employs wastes produced at the same location, it is reasonable to conclude that the method may be directly applied to incinerator plants due to the simplification of the MSWI FA waste management strategy, which generally involves its transport and stabilization treatment before landfilling. Finally the saved carbon dioxide emissions and the economic benefits that are a result of the new urban mining proposed approach have been evaluated for Europe. In particular the avoid of MSWI FA landfilling was evaluated to save approximately 1.6 M(sic)/day, and the saved carbon dioxide emissions introduced into the atmosphere is approximately 960 kt/year.

1759,Cooperative breeding and the emergence of multilevel societies in birds,"Ettore Camerlenghi,Alexandra McQueen,Kaspar Delhey,Carly N Cook,Sjouke A Kingma,Damien R Farine,Anne Peters,Ettore Camerlenghi,Alexandra McQueen,Kaspar Delhey,Carly N Cook,Sjouke A Kingma,Damien R Farine,Anne Peters","Multilevel societies (MLSs), where social levels are hierarchically nested within each other, are considered one of the most complex forms of animal societies. Although thought to mainly occurs in mammals, it is suggested that MLSs could be under-detected in birds. Here, we propose that the emergence of MLSs could be common in cooperatively breeding birds, as both systems are favoured by similar ecological and social drivers. We first investigate this proposition by systematically comparing evidence for multilevel social structure in cooperative and non-cooperative birds in Australia and New Zealand, a global hotspot for cooperative breeding. We then analyse non-breeding social networks of cooperatively breeding superb fairy-wrens (Malurus cyaneus) to reveal their structured multilevel society, with three hierarchical social levels that are stable across years. Our results confirm recent predictions that MLSs are likely to be widespread in birds and suggest that these societies could be particularly common in cooperatively breeding birds."

Now known as dominance hierarchies, these structures have been shown to influence a plethora of individual characteristics and outcomes, situating dominance research as a pillar of the study of modern social ecology and evolution. Here, we first review some of the major questions that have been answered about dominance hierarchies in the last 100 years. Next, we introduce the contributions to this theme issue and summarize how they provide ongoing insight in the epistemology, physiology and neurobiology, hierarchical structure, and dynamics of dominance. These contributions employ the full range of research approaches available to modern biologists. Cross-cutting themes emerging from these contributions include a focus on cognitive underpinnings of dominance, the application of network-analytical approaches, and the utility of experimental rank manipulations for revealing causal relationships. Reflection on the last 100 years of dominance research reveals how Schjelderup-Ebbe's early ideas and the subsequent research helped drive a shift from an essentialist view of species characteristics to the modern recognition of rich inter-individual variation in social, behavioural and physiological phenotypes. This article is part of the theme issue 'The centennial of the pecking order: current state and future prospects for the study of dominance hierarchies'."

To test whether fewer stimuli would suffice, A-SICI and T-SICI were recorded twice from 30 healthy subjects using 6 and 10 stimuli per ISI. Using fewer stimuli increased mean A-SICI variances by 23.8% but the 7.3% increase in T-SICI variance was not significant. We conclude that our new parallel threshold-tracking SICI protocol, with 6 stimuli per ISI, can reduce time and stimulus numbers by 40% without appreciable loss of accuracy."
1762,Epidemiological Aspects and Psychological Reactions to COVID-19 of Dental Practitioners in the Northern Italy Districts of Modena and Reggio Emilia,"Consolo, Ugo; Bellini, Pierantonio; Bencivenni, Davide; Iani, Cristina; Checchi, Vittorio","The outbreak and diffusion of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus-2 (Sars-CoV-2) and COronaVIrus Disease 19 (COVID-19) have caused an emergency status in the health system, including in the dentistry environment. Italy registered the third highest number of COVID-19 cases in the world and the second highest in Europe. An anonymous online survey composed of 40 questions has been sent to dentists practicing in the area of Modena and Reggio Emilia, one of the areas in Italy most affected by COVID-19. The survey was aimed at highlighting the practical and emotional consequences of COVID-19 emergence on daily clinical practice. Specifically, it assessed dentists' behavioral responses, emotions and concerns following the Sars-CoV-2 pandemic restrictive measures introduced by the Italian national administrative order of 10 March 2020 (DM-10M20), as well as the dentists' perception of infection likelihood for themselves and patients. Furthermore, the psychological impact of COVID-19 was assessed by means of the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 test (GAD-7), that measures the presence and severity of anxiety symptoms. Using local dental associations (ANDI-Associazione Nazionale Dentisti Italiani, CAO-Commissione Albo Odontoiatri) lists, the survey was sent by email to all dentists in the district of Modena and Reggio Emilia (874 practitioners) and was completed by 356 of them (40%). All dental practitioners closed or reduced their activity to urgent procedures, 38.2% prior to and 61.8% after the DM-10M20. All reported a routinely use of the most common protective personal equipment (PPE), but also admitted that the use of PPE had to be modified during COVID-19 pandemic. A high percentage of patients canceled their previous appointments after the DM-10M20. Almost 85% of the dentists reported being worried of contracting the infection during clinical activity. The results of the GAD-7 (General Anxiety Disorder-7) evaluation showed that 9% of respondents reported a severe anxiety. To conclude, the COVID-19 emergency is having a highly negative impact on the activity of dentists practicing in the area of Modena and Reggio Emilia. All respondents reported practice closure or strong activity reduction. The perception of this negative impact was accompanied by feelings of concern (70.2%), anxiety (46.4%) and fear (42.4%). The majority of them (89.6%) reported concerns about their professional future and the hope for economic measures to help dental practitioners."
1763,Task demands moderate the effect of emotion on attentional capture,"Louise Humphreys,Sarah Higgins,Emma V Roberts,Louise Humphreys,Sarah Higgins,Emma V Roberts","The current experiment examined the effect of task demands on attention to emotional images. Eighty participants viewed pairs of images, with each pair consisting of an emotional (negative or positive) and a neutral image, or two neutral images. Participants' eye movements were recorded during picture viewing, and participants were either asked (1) which picture contains more colour? (colour task), (2) are the images equally pleasant? (pleasantness task), (3) which picture do you prefer? (preference task), or (4) were given no task instructions (control task). Although the results did not suggest that emotional images strongly captured attention, emotional images were looked at earlier than neutral images. Importantly, the pattern of results was dependent on the task instructions; while the preference and colour task conditions showed early attentional biases to emotional images, only positive images were looked at earlier in the pleasantness task condition, and no early attentional biases were observed in the control task. Moreover, total fixation duration was increased for positive images in the preference task condition, but not in the other task conditions. It was concluded that attention to emotional stimuli can be modified by the demands of the task during viewing. However, further research should consider additional factors, such as the cognitive load of the viewing tasks and the content of the images used."
1764,Ensemble learning-based structural health monitoring by Mahalanobis distance metrics,"Sarmadi, Hassan; Entezami, Alireza; Saeedi Razavi, Behzad; Yuen, Ka-Veng","Environmental variability is still a major challenge in structural health monitoring. Due to the similarity of changes caused by environmental variations to damage, false positive and false negative errors are prevalent in detecting damage that cause serious economic and safety issues. To address this challenge and its disadvantages, this article proposes a novel ensemble learning-based method in a nongenerative sequential algorithm for structural health monitoring under varying environmental conditions by three kinds of Mahalanobis distance metrics in three main levels. At each level, one attempts to find a few and adequate nearest neighbors of each feature to remove environmental variability via an innovative approach. The major contribution of this article is to develop a novel data-based method by the concepts of ensemble learning and unsupervised learning. The great advantages of the proposed method include developing a nonparametric data-based framework without estimating any unknown parameter, dealing with the negative effects of environmental variability, improving the performance of Mahalanobis distance, and increasing damage detectability. The performance and effectiveness of this method are validated by modal features of two real bridge structures along with several comparisons. Results demonstrate that the proposed ensemble learning-based method highly succeeds in detecting damage under environmental variability, and it is superior to some state-of-the-art techniques."

The neoplasm originates from prostatic tissue and is typically found within the rectovesical pouch, varying in both size and morphology. Microscopically, GMC contains both glandular and cystic prostatic tissue lined by cuboidal and columnar epithelium. Symptoms often arise once the pelvic mass begins to obstruct the surrounding structures and organs, although invasion into surrounding tissue is unlikely. Common symptoms include abdominal pain, urinary retention, and dysuria. The standard treatment for GMC is surgical removal of the mass with good outcomes and only 1 known case of recurrence. Here we present the case of a 14-year-old male with GMC-the youngest patient reported to date-who presented with abdominal pain, difficulty voiding, and hydroureteronephrosis."

While the huge impact of the pandemic has nurtured important literature over the last couple of years, little is being said about the role of resource orchestration in supporting resilience in highly disruptive contexts. Thus, this study aims to this knowledge gap by proposing an original model to explore supply chain resilience (SCRE) antecedents, considering supply chain alertness (SCAL) as a central point to support resilience. This study focuses on the resource orchestration theory (ROT) to design a conceptual model. The partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) served to validate the model, exploring data from the UK supply chain decision-makers. The study reveals a number of both expected and unexpected findings. These include the evidence that supply chain disruption orientation (SCDO) has a strong positive effect on the SCAL. In addition, SCAL plays a strong positive effect in resource reconfiguration (RREC), supply chain efficiency (SCEF) and SCRE. We further identified a partial mediation effect of RREC on the relationship between SCAL and SCRE. Surprisingly, it appeared that SCAL strongly influences SCEF, while SCEF itself does not create any significant effect on SCRE. For managers and practitioners, the importance of resource orchestration as a decisive approach to adequately respond to huge disruptions is clearly highlighted by our results. Finally, this paper helps to grasp better how important resource orchestration in operations and supply chains remains for appropriate responses to high disruptions such as the COVID-19 impacts."
1767,Exploring the nonlinear association between environmental regulation and carbon intensity in China: The mediating effect of green technology,"Yang, Guanglei; Zha, Donglan; Wang, Xiaojuan; Chen, Qian","Environmental regulation and green technology are important to mitigate global warming, whereas few studies explored the role of green technology in environmental regulation on carbon intensity. This paper systematically reviews the literature on the relationship among environmental regulation, green technology, and carbon intensity, and assumes that green technology is a potential mediator of the impact of environmental regulation on carbon intensity. The advanced SBM model and the factor analysis method were performed to measure the relationships. To explore the mediating effect of green technology, the two-step econometric model and the nonlinear mediating effect model were applied to a panel dataset of 30 provinces in China spanning the period 2005-2016. The results show that there is an inverted U-shaped relationship between environmental regulation and green technology, and a U-shaped relationship between environmental regulation and carbon intensity. Green technology has a significant negative impact on carbon intensity. This proves that green technology is an important mediating variable on the relationship between environmental regulation and carbon intensity. Moreover, the current environmental regulation intensity lies before the inflection point of both the inverted Ushaped and the U-shaped curves. The effects of environmental regulation on green technology and carbon intensity in developed and developing regions follow an inverted U-shaped, and a U-shaped curve, respectively. Furthermore, the mediating effect in developing regions is significantly larger than that in developed regions. Finally, policy implications are given to reduce carbon intensity."
1768,Application of life cycle analysis to assess environmental sustainability of wheat cultivation in the west of Iran,"Ghasemi-Mobtaker, Hassan; Kaab, Ali; Rafiee, Shahin","Today, intensive use of energy sources leads to environmental damages such as global warming and resources depletion. Hence, this study provided energy, environmental and economic overview of wheat cultivation in Hamedan province, Iran. The initial data were collected from 75 wheat farms applying face-to-face interview technique. The prepared data related to the 2017-2018 production cycle. The energy analysis results demonstrated that the total energy consumption and output energy in wheat cultivation were 43054.63 MJ ha(-1) and 117407.13 MJ ha(-1), respectively. Energy productivity, energy use efficiency and net energy gain were computed as 0.12 kg MJ(-1), 2.73 and 74352.50 MJ ha(-1), respectively. Economic analysis showed that total value and cost of wheat production were 854.86 $ ha(-1) and 366.57 $ ha(-1), respectively. Net return was 488.29 $ ha(-1) and benefit to cost ratio computed as 2.33 in the investigated region. Wheat environmental impacts were evaluated by applying life cycle assessment methodology. Results of environmental impacts showed the largest emissions were related to marine aquatic ecotoxicity (319757.6377 kg 1,4-DB (eq).), abiotic depletion (fossil fuels) (6673.1319 MJ) and global warming potential (624.2944 kg CO2 (eq).). Electricity was a hotspot in abiotic depletion (fossil fuels), global warming potential, freshwater aquatic ecotoxicity, ozone layer depletion and photochemical oxidation impact categories. Cumulative exergy demand results indicated that the rates of non-renewable fossil (7088.05 MJ ha(-1)) for wheat farms mainly resulted from electricity and nitrogen fertilizer. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

1769,"Distribution of COVID-19 Morbidity Rate in Association with Social and Economic Factors in Wuhan, China: Implications for Urban Development","You, Heyuan; Wu, Xin; Guo, Xuxu","Social and economic factors relate to the prevention and control of infectious diseases. The purpose of this paper was to assess the distribution of COVID-19 morbidity rate in association with social and economic factors and discuss the implications for urban development that help to control infectious diseases. This study was a cross-sectional study. In this study, social and economic factors were classified into three dimensions: built environment, economic activities, and public service status. The method applied in this study was the spatial regression analysis. In the 13 districts in Wuhan, the spatial regression analysis was applied. The results showed that: 1) increasing population density, construction land area proportion, value-added of tertiary industry per unit of land area, total retail sales of consumer goods per unit of land area, public green space density, aged population density were associated with an increased COVID-19 morbidity rate due to the positive characteristics of estimated coefficients of these variables. 2) increasing average building scale, GDP per unit of land area, and hospital density were associated with a decreased COVID-19 morbidity rate due to the negative characteristics of estimated coefficients of these variables. It was concluded that it is possible to control infectious diseases, such as COVID-19, by adjusting social and economic factors. We should guide urban development to improve human health."
1770,Comparative economic and life cycle assessment of solar-based hydrogen production for oil and gas industries,"Sadeghi, Shayan; Ghandehariun, Samane; Rosen, Marc A.","Hydrogen is used in the petroleum industry to upgrade crude oil in refineries or as a chemical agent to produce ammonia, methanol and other products. It is mainly supplied by conventional production methods based on fossil fuels. Solar-based hydrogen production is a potentially advantageous option to the problems of climate change and depletion of conventional fuel supplies. Four hydrogen production pathways including steam methane reforming, coal gasification, photovoltaic and solar thermal electrolysis are considered in this study. This paper investigates solar hydrogen potential in terms of cost and emissions as a replacement for conventional methods to provide the hydrogen required in oil and gas industries. GHG abatement costs are evaluated to compare the proposed methods with a reference method. As steam methane reforming is the most common method used in the petroleum industry, it is considered as the reference method in this study. Our results show that the GHG abatement costs are $0.786/kg CO2 and $1.37/kg CO2 for PV and solar thermal electrolysis, respectively. An uncertainty analysis is also conducted to assess the effects of variations of different parameters on the results. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."
1771,Quantifying the green view indicator for assessing urban greening quality: An analysis based on Internet-crawling street view data,"Chen, Jinjin; Zhou, Chuanbin; Li, Feng","The quality and aesthetic ecosystem services of urban green spaces can be assessed by green view (GV), which is an indicator to quantify the percentage of green area visually sensed by human eyes. There are several case studies on estimating GV at city-scale, however, the relationship between GV values and socio-economic & morphologic profiles of cities was rarely discussed. In this work, we analyzed the GV values and their potentially influential factors by adopting an internet data crawling approach, obtaining 36,654 panoramic Street View images from Baidu Map, in the urban zones at the Pearl River Delta Urban Agglomeration (PRDUA), China. We calculated the GV value of each panoramic image using MATLAB 2015a, extracting the value of the hue channel from the digital image and then calculating pixel ratio according the color spectrum. Results show that: (1) The overall GV in PRDUA is 11.3 +/- 7.5%, lower than the cases of the developed countries; (2) More green could be sensed on the streets at the old central districts and the central business district in the cities in PRDUA; (3) The GV value is positively affected by public revenue per unit area, but is uncorrelated to green space coverage ratio, at the district-level. It indicates that an improved design and increasing monetary investment of urban green space may obtain higher people-oriented green quantity in cities. These findings can be useful for drafting more appropriate urban green space planning policies regarding the green view."
1772,"The BCH message banking process™, voice banking, and double-dipping™","John Costello,Martine Smith,John Costello,Martine Smith","Significant advances have been made in interventions to maintain communication and personhood for individuals with neurodegenerative conditions. One innovation is Message Banking, a clinical approach first developed at Boston Children's Hospital (BCH). This paper outlines the Message Banking process as implemented at BCH, which includes the option of ""Double Dipping,"" where banked messages are mined to develop personalized synthesized voices. More than a decade of experience has led to the evolution of six core principles underpinning the BCH process, resulting in a structured introduction of the associated concepts and practices with people with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and their families. These principles highlight the importance of assigning ownership and control of the process to individuals with ALS and their families, ensuring that as a tool it is empowering and offers hope. Changes have been driven by feedback from individuals who have participated in the BCH process over many years. The success of the process has recently been extended through partnerships that allow the recorded messages to be used to develop individual personalized synthetic voices to complement banked messages. While the process of banking messages is technically relatively simple, the full value of the process should be underpinned by the values and principles outlined in this tutorial."
1773,Sesamol prevents mitochondrial impairment and pro-inflammatory alterations in the human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells: role for Nrf2,"Sônia Mendes da Silva Navarro,Fhelipe Jolner Souza de Almeida,Matheus Dargesso Luckachaki,Marcos Roberto de Oliveira,Sônia Mendes da Silva Navarro,Fhelipe Jolner Souza de Almeida,Matheus Dargesso Luckachaki,Marcos Roberto de Oliveira","Mitochondria are a primary source and a target of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Increased mitochondrial production of ROS is associated with bioenergetics decline, cell death, and inflammation. Here we investigated whether a pretreatment (for 24 h) with sesamol (SES; at 12.5-50 µM) would be efficient in preventing the mitochondrial collapse induced by hydrogen peroxide (H2O2, at 300 µM) in the human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cell line. We have found that a pretreatment with SES at 25 µM decreased the effects of H2O2 on lipid peroxidation, protein carbonylation, and protein nitration in membranes obtained from the mitochondria isolated from the SH-SY5Y cells. In this regard, SES pretreatment decreased the production of superoxide anion radical (O2-•) by the mitochondria of H2O2-treated cells. SES also prevented the mitochondrial dysfunction induced by H2O2, as assessed by analyzing the activity of the complexes I and V. The H2O2-induced reduction in the production of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) was also prevented by SES. The levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), as well as the activity of the transcription factor nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) were downregulated by the SES pretreatment in the H2O2-challenged cells. Silencing of the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) transcription factor abolished the protection induced by SES regarding mitochondrial function and inflammation. Thus, SES depends on Nrf2 to promote mitochondrial protection in cells facing redox impairment."

The health benefits of fermented foods are due to the presence of probiotic microbes and the bioactive compounds formed during fermentation. Microbes involved and metabolites produced by them are highly species specific and contribute to the authenticity of the fermented foods. Several studies pertaining to the effect of fermented foods on various disease conditions have been conducted in recent years using both animal models and clinical trials on humans. This review focuses on the impact of fermented foods on conditions such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, obesity, gastrointestinal disorder, cancer and neurodegenerative disorders."
1775,"Geothermal driven micro-CCHP for domestic application - Exergy, economic and sustainability analysis","Nami, Hossein; Anvari-Moghaddam, Amjad","Geothermal energy is going to play a key role in future smart energy systems. Geothermal-driven domestic energy systems, specifically, will largely contribute to the baseload supply of heating and cooling demand of societies. A low-temperature geothermal resource is considered to drive a domestic-scaled multi-generation system supplying power, heating, and cooling. The proposed cogeneration system includes a small-scale organic Rankine cycle (ORC), a single effect LiBr-H2O absorption chiller, and heat exchangers to supply domestic space heating and hot water. The waste heat of the ORC is harvested, also, to be used in space heating. Energy, exergy, economic, and sustainability principles are applied to the system to evaluate the system thermodynamic and thermos-economic performance. Results associated with the exergy destruction are obtained and effects on the system performance of chiller supply are investigated. Besides, the thermodynamic performance of the system is evaluated under the summer-time and wintertime conditions. Under the base condition, the generator employed in the absorption chiller is found to be the most exergy destructive unit followed by the evaporator utilized in the ORC. Furthermore, results revealed that by increasing the chiller supply rate, the system sustainability index enhances from 1.6 to 2.5 while the system's first law efficiency reduces.

1776,"Energy, exergy, economic and exergoenvironmental analyses of gas and air bottoming cycles for production of electricity and hydrogen with gas reformer","Ahmadi, A.; Jamali, D. H.; Ehyaei, M. A.; Assad, M. El Haj","The purpose of this study is to investigate an intergration of three cycles consisting of gas, air bottom and steam cycles for electrical power generation and hydrogen production. The configuration of the three cycles is powered by the natural gas that is used by the gas cycle on the top. Then, the exhaust gas of the gas cycle is used by an air cycle at the bottom of the gas cycle and consequently a heat recovery steam generator (HRSG) is driven by the exhaust gas of the air cycle. The purpose of the HRSG cycle is to produce steam to be used in the reformer for the hydrogen production. The energy, exergy, economic and exergoenvironmental analyses of this combined cycle is examined. The results of this study show that addition of air gas cycle to natural gas cycle improves the energy efficiency from 17.2% to 28.% and Payback Period (PP) from 4.72 to 2.92. Whereas, adding HRSG to the whole cycle improves the energy efficiency to 67.6% and Payback Period to 0.41 years. Moreover, this interagation of the cycles improves the Net Present Value (NPV) from 1.13 x 10(9) to 2.07 x 10(9) for gas and air cycle, respectively and to 3.89 x 10(10) $ by the whole cycle.

1777,The role of junctophilin proteins in cellular function,"Stephan E Lehnart,Xander H T Wehrens,Stephan E Lehnart,Xander H T Wehrens","Junctophilins (JPHs) comprise a family of structural proteins that connect the plasma membrane to intracellular organelles such as the endo/sarcoplasmic reticulum (ER/SR). Tethering of these membrane structures results in the formation of highly organized subcellular junctions that play important signaling roles in all excitable cell types. There are four JPH isoforms, expressed primarily in muscle and neuronal cell types. Each JPH protein consists of six membrane occupation and recognition nexus (MORN) motifs, a joining region connecting these to another set of two MORN motifs, a putative alpha-helical region, a divergent region exhibiting low homology between JPH isoforms, and a carboxy-terminal transmembrane region anchoring into the ER/SR membrane. JPH isoforms play essential roles in developing and maintaining subcellular membrane junctions. Conversely, inherited mutations in JPH2 cause hypertrophic or dilated cardiomyopathy, while trinucleotide expansions in the JPH3 gene cause Huntington Disease-Like 2. Loss of JPH1 protein levels can cause skeletal myopathy, while loss of cardiac JPH2 levels causes heart failure and atrial fibrillation, among other disease. This review will provide a comprehensive overview of the JPH gene family, phylogeny, and evolutionary analysis of JPH genes and other MORN domain proteins. JPH biogenesis, membrane tethering, and binding partners will be discussed, as well as functional roles of JPH isoforms in excitable cells. Finally, potential roles of JPH isoform deficits in human disease pathogenesis will be reviewed."
1778,"Associations between pro-environmental behaviour and neighbourhood nature, nature visit frequency and nature appreciation: Evidence from a nationally representative survey in England","Alcock, Ian; White, Mathew P.; Pahl, Sabine; Duarte-Davidson, Raquel; Fleming, Lora E.","Progress on changing human behaviour to meet the challenges of regional and global sustainability has been slow. Building on theory as well as small-scale survey and experimental evidence that exposure to nature may be associated with greater pro-environmentalism, the aim of the current study was to quantify relationships between exposure to nature (operationalised as neighbourhood greenspace, coastal proximity, and recreational nature visits) as well as appreciation of the natural world, and self-reported pro-environmental behaviour for the adult population of England. Using data from a nationally representative sample (N = 24,204), and controlling for potential confounders, a structural equation model was used to estimate relationships. Indirect effects of neighbourhood exposures via nature visits and nature appreciation were accounted for. We found positive relationships between both recreational nature visits and nature appreciation and pro-environmental behaviour across both the whole sample and key socio-demographic groups. The more individuals visited nature for recreation and the more they appreciated the natural world, the more pro-environmental behaviour they reported. Although rural and coastal dwellers tended to also be more pro-environmental on average, patterns were complex, potentially reflecting situational constraints and opportunities. Importantly, positive associations between pro-environmental behaviours and high neighbourhood greenspace and coastal proximity were present for both high and low socio-economic status households. Improving access to, and contact with, nature, e.g., through better urban planning, may be one approach for meeting sustainability targets."

Muhtasim; Ahmed, Humaira Nafisa; Paul, Sumit; Garshasbi, Maryam; Ali, Syed Mithun; Kabir, Golam; Paul, Sanjoy Kumar","This paper aims to identify the negative impacts of the COVID-19 outbreak on supply chains and propose strategies to deal with the impacts in the context of the readymade garment (RMG) industry supply chain of an emerging economy: Bangladesh. To achieve the aims, a methodological framework is proposed through a literature review, expert inputs, and a decision-aid tool, namely the grey-based digraph-matrix method. A total of 10 types of negative impacts and 22 strategic measures to tackle the impacts were identified based on the literature review and expert inputs. Then, the grey-based digraph-matrix was applied for modeling the strategic measures based on their influence to deal with the impacts. Findings reveal that the strategies ""manufacturing flexibility"", ""diversify the source of supply"", and ""develop backup suppliers"" have significant positive consequences for managing the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic in the RMG supply chain. The findings help industrial managers recover from supply chain disruptions by identifying and classifying the impacts and strategies required to manage the major supply chain disturbances caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. As a theoretical contribution, this study is one of few initial attempts to evaluate the impacts of the COVID-19 outbreak and the strategies to deal with the impacts in the supply chain context."

The present study aimed to investigate the roles of icariin and miR-23a-3p in the osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs and an ONFH model. BMSCs were isolated and cultured in vitro using icariin-containing serum at various concentrations, and BMSCs were also transfected with a miR-23a inhibitor. The alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity and cell viability as well as BMP-2/Smad5/Runx2 and WNT/β-catenin pathway-related mRNA and protein expression were measured in BMSCs. Additionally, a dual-luciferase reporter assay and pathway inhibitors were used to verify the relationship of icariin treatment/miR-23a and the above pathways. An ONFH rat model was established in vivo, and a 28-day gavage treatment and lentivirus transfection of miR-23a-3p inhibitor were performed. Then, bone biochemical markers (ELISA kits) in serum, femoral head (HE staining and Digital Radiography, DR) and the above pathway-related proteins were detected. Our results revealed that icariin treatment/miR-23a knockdown promoted BMSC viability and osteogenic differentiation as well as increased the mRNA and protein expression of BMP-2, BMP-4, Runx2, p-Smad5, Wnt1 and β-catenin in BMSCs and ONFH model rats. In addition, icariin treatment/miR-23a knockdown increased bone biochemical markers (ACP-5, BAP, NTXI, CTXI and OC) and improved ONFH in ONFH model rats. In addition, a dual-luciferase reporter assay verified that Runx2 was a direct target of miR-23a-3p. These data indicated that icariin promotes BMSC viability and osteogenic differentiation as well as improves ONFH by decreasing miR-23a-3p levels and regulating the BMP-2/Smad5/Runx2 and WNT/β-catenin pathways."
1781,Combined heat and power from hydrothermal geothermal resources in Germany: An assessment of the potential,"Eyerer, S.; Schifflechner, C.; Hofbauer, S.; Bauer, W.; Wieland, C.; Spliethoff, H.","This study investigates the potential of hydrothermal geothermal energy for combined heat and power (CHP) generation in Germany. Based on the theoretical potential of hydrothermal heat in place, the technical and economic potential is determined with a review and an analysis of existing geothermal plants. To this end, the thermodynamic and economic performance of operating power plants is analyzed and models for the efficiency and the production costs are developed. Based on this analysis, a technical potential of 12.2 PWh(el) and 16.7 PWh(th) as well as an economic potential of 9.1 PWh(el) and 12.5 PWh(th) is determined. In order to derive an annual contribution from the economic potential, the regeneration of the resource is taken into account. Considering a sustainable exploitation rate, an annual economic potential of 9.1 TWh(el)/a and 12.5 TWh(th)/a is derived. This corresponds to a share of 1.51% of the gross electricity demand and a share of 1.48% of the demand for space heating and domestic hot water. This analysis provides a profound review about the existing geothermal power plants and their thermodynamic and economic performance. Furthermore, the assessment of the geothermal potential in Germany is necessary for political decision making, particular with a view towards future adjustments of the feed-in tariffs defined by the Renewable Energy Act."
1782,Mapping the Sustainable Development Goals Relationships,"Fonseca, Luis Miguel; Domingues, Jose Pedro; Dima, Alina Mihaela","Sustainable development addresses humanity's aspiration for a better life while observing the limitations imposed by nature. In 2015, the United Nations General Assembly approved the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) with the aim to foster the organizational operationalization and integration of sustainability and, therefore, to address the current and forthcoming stakeholder needs and ensure a better and sustainable future for all, balancing the economic, social, and environmental development. However, it is not entirely clear which are the mutual relationships among the 17 SDGs and this study aims to tackle this research gap. The results of the correlation confirm that Poverty elimination (SDG1) and Good health and well-being (SDG3) have synergetic relationships with most of the other goals. SDG7 (Affordable and clean energy) has significant relationships with other SDGs (e.g., SDG1 (No poverty), SDG2 (Zero hunger), SDG3 (Good health and well-being), SDG8 (Decent work and economic growth), SDG13 (Climate action)). However, there is a moderate negative correlation with SDG12 (Responsible consumption and production), which emphasizes the need to improve energy efficiency, increase the share of clean and renewable energies and improve sustainable consumption patterns worldwide. There is also confirmation that SDG12 (Responsible consumption and production) is the goal strongly associated with trade-offs. To sum up, this research suggests that change towards achieving the Sustainable Development Goals offers many opportunities for reinforcing rather than inhibiting itself. However, some SDGs show no significant correlation with other SDGs (e.g., SDG13 (Climate action) and SDG17 (Partnerships for the goals), which highlights the need for future research."

1784,Impact of green finance on economic development and environmental quality: a study based on provincial panel data from China,"Zhou, Xiaoguang; Tang, Xinmeng; Zhang, Rui","The goal of green finance is to pursue the coordinated development of financial activities, environmental protection, and ecological balance. This study aims to examine the impact of green finance on economic development and environmental quality. Data concerning green finance, economic development, and environmental quality for 30 provinces and municipalities in China from 2010 to 2017 are used. First, the global principal component analysis is adopted to develop a green finance development index. Second, a model of the impact of green finance on economic development is constructed, which indicates that the development of green finance plays a role in promoting economic development. Next, emissions of industrial smoke (powder) dust, industrial solid waste, and carbon dioxide are used to represent the environmental variables, and a model of the impact of green finance on environmental quality is proposed. The model shows that green finance has a positive effect on environment improvement. However, the impact of green finance on environmental quality varies for different levels of economic development. Finally, based on the theory of the environmental Kuznets curve, a model of the impact of green finance on the relationship between economic development and environmental quality is developed. The model indicates that green finance can significantly improve this relationship, creating a win-win situation regarding economic development and the environment."

When there is an association between the two responses, a joint model will produce improved results than fitting them separately. In this paper, a Bayesian method is proposed to jointly model such data. The joint model links the qualitative and quantitative responses and can assess their dependency strength via a latent variable. The posterior distributions of parameters are obtained through an efficient MCMC sampling algorithm. The simulation is conducted to show that the proposed method improves the prediction capacity for both responses. Further, the proposed joint model is applied to the birth records data acquired by the Virginia Department of Health for studying the mutual dependence between preterm birth of infants and their birth weights."
1786,Inhibition of TRPM2 by AG490 Is Neuroprotective in a Parkinson's Disease Animal Model,"Ana Flávia Fernandes Ferreira,Monique Patricio Singulani,Henning Ulrich,Zhong-Ping Feng,Hong-Shuo Sun,Luiz Roberto Britto,Ana Flávia Fernandes Ferreira,Monique Patricio Singulani,Henning Ulrich,Zhong-Ping Feng,Hong-Shuo Sun,Luiz Roberto Britto","Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by motor impairment and dopaminergic neuronal loss. There is no cure for the disease, and treatments have several limitations. The transient receptor potential melastatin 2 (TRPM2), a calcium-permeable non-selective cation channel, has been reported to be upregulated in neuronal death. However, there are no in vivo studies evaluating TRPM2's role and neuroprotective effects in PD. Here, we test the hypothesis that TRPM2 is upregulated in the 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) mouse model of PD and that its inhibition, by the AG490, is neuroprotective. For that, AG490 or vehicle were intraperitoneally administered into C57BL/6 mice. Mice then received 6-OHDA into the right striatum. Motor behavior assessments were evaluated 6, 13, and 20 days after surgery using the cylinder and apomorphine-induced rotational testes, and 7, 14, and 21 days after surgery using rotarod test. Brain samples of substantia nigra (SNc) and striatum (CPu) were collected for immunohistochemistry and immunoblotting on days 7 and 21. We showed that TRPM2 protein expression was upregulated in 6-OHDA-treated animals. In addition, AG490 prevented dopaminergic neuron loss, microglial activation, and astrocyte reactivity in 6-OHDA-treated animals. The compound improved motor behaviors and Akt/GSK-3β/caspase-3 signaling. We conclude that TRPM2 inhibition by AG490 is neuroprotective in the 6-OHDA model and that the TRPM2 channel may represent a potential therapeutic target for PD."
1787,Circular Economy Innovation and Environmental Sustainability Impact on Economic Growth: An Integrated Model for Sustainable Development,"Hysa, Eglantina; Kruja, Alba; Rehman, Naqeeb Ur; Laurenti, Rafael","This study examines the link between selected indicators of a circular economy, including essential components of environmental and economic growth. Developed economies are continuously innovating to promote growth and giving governmental support to the producers to move from linear economies to circular ones. Hence, waste materials in industrial systems are recycled or re-used, improving the efficiency of using finite resources with the no-waste approach. The aim of this paper is the following: (1) to identify the main components of a circular economy, which are also supportive of sustainability and development; (2) to check the impact of these variables in the economic growth of European Union countries; (3) to find out if the three components of sustainable development adopted to circular economy (CE) indicators (environmental-social-economic) are significant to economic growth. We used a fixed effect panel data analysis to identify the circular economy's impact on the economic growth of European countries. Additionally, to support the results of the regression analysis, we employed a second method-generalized methods of moments-computing the Arellano-Bond dynamic panel data estimation method. The model included five independent variables, such as environmental tax rate, a recycling rate of waste, private investment and jobs in a circular economy, patents related to recycling, and trade of recyclable raw materials. The identification of each variable was made based on a deep search through literature. The results of both econometric models showed a strong and positive correlation between a circular economy to economic growth, highlighting the crucial role of sustainability, innovation, and investment in no-waste initiatives to promote wealth."

Previous methods for the detection of mtDNA contamination mainly focus on haplogroup-level phylogeny, but neglect haplotype-level differences, leading to limited sensitivity and accuracy. In our study, we present mitoDataclean, a random-forest-based machine learning package for accurate identification of cross-contamination, evaluation of contamination levels and detection of contamination-derived variants in mtDNA NGS data. Comprehensive optimization of mitoDataclean revealed that training simulation with mixtures of small haplogroup distance and low polymorphic difference was critical for optimal modeling. Compared to existing methods, mitoDataclean exhibited significantly improved sensitivity and accuracy for the detection of sample contamination in simulated data. In addition, mitoDataclean achieved area under the curve values of 0.91 and 0.97 for discerning genuine and contamination-derived mtDNA variants in a simulated Western dataset and private sequencing contamination data, respectively, suggesting that this tool may be applicable for different populations and samples with different sources of contamination. Finally, mitoDataclean was further evaluated in several private and public datasets and showed a robust ability for contamination detection. Altogether, our study demonstrates that mitoDataclean may be used for accurate detection of contaminated samples and contamination-derived variants in mtDNA NGS data."

In this study, effect of Cu nanocluster on prevention and control of disease transmission was examined using molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulation studies on the SARS-CoV-2 main protease and spike glycoprotein. The cytotoxicity of different shapes of copper NPs and resonance changes of their surface plasmons on inactivation of the coronavirus was examined in order to control replication of coronavirus through copper NPs, active site of protease and spike glycoprotein. The simulations results showed that interactions of SARS-CoV-2 main protease and spike glycoprotein target and cylindrical and conical copper NPs ligands were more efficient than spherical copper NPs."

Psychological deficits such as anxiety, depression, impaired memory and cognitive decline are caused by noise stress. Different vitamins have been used as a potential antioxidant for neuronal protection. In this study we investigate the anxiolytic, antidepressant and memory enhancing effect of vitamin D2 (Vit D2) following noise stress. Thirty-six albino rats were randomly divided into six groups. (i) Unstressed + corn oil (ii) Unstressed + Vit D2 (iii) Acute noise stress + corn oil (iv) Acute noise stress + Vit D2 (v) Repeated noise stress + corn oil (vi) Repeated noise stress + Vit D2. 600 IU/kg body weight of Vit D2 dosage was prepared in corn oil. Corn oil is used as vehicle and all the drugs administered via oral gavage till end of the experiment (day 16). Recorded sound of generator which was amplified by speakers and had 100 dB intensity was used as noise stress. Repeated stressed animals were exposed to noise (4-hrs) daily for 14 days, while acute stressed animals were exposed to noise (4-hrs) once after 14 days. Behavioral tests (elevated plus maze, light dark box, tail suspension test and Morris water maze) of all groups were performed after15 days treatment period. After behavioral tests rats received their last dosage and decapitated after 1-hr. Brain of all animals was removed and used for biochemical (oxidative stress biomarker, antioxidant enzymes and acetylcholinesterase) and histopathological estimations. Results show that Vit D2 decreased time spent in light box and open arm of light dark activity box and elevated plus maze test respectively (used for anxiety evaluation), decreased immobility time in tail suspension test (for depression) and improved cognitive ability evaluated by Morris water maze test in acute and repeated noise stressed rats. Furthermore, increased antioxidant enzymes activity, decreased lipid peroxidation and acetylcholinesterase activity were also observed in Vit D2 treated animals following acute and repeated noise stress. Normalization in histopathological studies was also observed in Vit D2 treated following acute and repeated noise stress. It is concluded that Vit D2 protects from noise stress induced behavioral, biochemical and histopathological impairment through its antioxidant potential."
1791,"Investigation of an integrated system combining an Organic Rankine Cycle and absorption chiller driven by geothermal energy: Energy, exergy, and economic analyses and optimization","Ehyaei, M. A.; Ahmadi, A.; Assad, M. El Haj; Rosen, Marc A.","This study aims to investigate a novel hybrid system for combined cooling and power (CCP) driven by geothermal energy. This study is performed using energy, exergy, and economic analyses. The results of this study show that application of LiBr absorption chiller downstream of the Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC) cycle increases the energy efficiency of the system from 9.3% to 47.3%. But it decreases the exergy efficiency from 15.6% to 4.6%, mainly due to the increase in the exergy destruction of the system. By definition of a new parameter called the electricity and cooling cost for this hybrid system, the results show this parameter decreases from 0.0552 to 0.0028 $/kWh when the LiBr absorption chiller cycle is added. Moreover, a multi-objective optimization of this hybrid system is carried out by the MOPSO algorithm for two objective functions including cost of electricity and cooling (C-EC), and exergy efficiency (eta(ex)). The results show that the optimum electricity and cooling cost and exergy efficiency are 0.0033 $/kWh, and 6.8%, respectively. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."

Here we explore computationally the role of heme in protein folding and protein structure. We model heme proteins using a hybrid model employing the AWSEM Hamiltonian, a coarse-grained forcefield for the protein chain along with AMBER, an all-atom forcefield for the heme. We carefully designed transferable force fields that model the interactions between the protein and the heme. The types of protein-ligand interactions in the hybrid model include thioester covalent bonds, coordinated covalent bonds, hydrogen bonds, and electrostatics. We explore the influence of different types of hemes (heme b and heme c) on folding and structure prediction. Including both types of heme improves the quality of protein structure predictions. The free energy landscape shows that both types of heme can act as nucleation sites for protein folding and stabilize the protein folded state. In binding the heme, coordinated covalent bonds and thioester covalent bonds for heme c drive the heme toward the native pocket. The electrostatics also facilitates the search for the binding site."
1793,A comparative analysis of novel combined flash-binary cycles for Sabalan geothermal wells: Thermodynamic and exergoeconomic viewpoints,"Abdolalipouradl, Mehran; Mohammadkhani, Farzad; Khalilarya, Shahram","Sabalan geothermal field is one of the most important geothermal fields in Iran. In this study, four novel configurations namely Single Flash-ORC (SF-ORC), Double Flash 1-ORC (DF1-ORC), Double Flash 2-ORC (DF2-ORC) and Triple Flash-ORC (TF-ORC) are proposed to produce power from two wells of the field. The configurations are assessed by thermodynamic and exergoeconomic viewpoints. The exergy and SPECO based exergoeconomic equations are developed for the components of the proposed cycles and thermodynamic as well as exergoeconomic performance parameters are calculated for the components and the cycles. A comprehensive parametric study is also carried out for the proposed configurations considering various working fluids in the ORCs. Moreover, an optimization is performed to maximize the produced power from the wells. The results depicted that the DF1-ORC produces 4.03%, 1.32% and 1.2% more power than the SF-ORC, DF2-ORC and TF-ORC, respectively, in the optimum condition. It can be concluded from the exergoeconomic analysis that the SF-ORC with R123 working fluid has the best exergoeconomic performance with the power specific cost of 3.62 $/GJ. The thermodynamic and exergoeconomic performance of the DF1-ORC is compared with previous similar studies which shows the superiority of the proposed cycle. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

1794,Do country risks influence carbon dioxide emissions? A non-linear perspective,"Zhang, Wenwen; Chiu, Yi-Bin","This study explores the non-linear effects of real income, energy use, and country risks on carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions in a panel of 111 countries from 1985 to 2014. By applying the panel smooth transition regression model, we find that real income, energy use, and country risks have different impacts on CO2 emissions when using country risks as thresholds. As to the full sample, the results show an inverted U-shaped relationship between CO2 emissions and economic risk, and that the financial and political risk indices have monotonically increasing effects on CO2 emissions. As country risks decrease, the positive effects of real income and energy use on CO2 emissions are first large and then become small. Moreover, with country risks changing, low-income countries have larger sensitivities to CO2 emissions. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."

To date, only two studies have investigated the role of metacognitive functioning, but among the adolescent population. The first aim of the current research was to assess and compare adult male gamblers with healthy controls (HCs) in relation to metacognition, impulsivity and emotional dysregulation. The second aim was to identify the variables among metacognition, impulsivity and emotional dysregulation associated with the severity of GD by means of linear regression.A total of 116 adult males (58 with GD and 58 HCs) completed self-report questionnaires on gambling severity, metacognition, emotional dysregulation and impulsivity. A linear regression analysis was run to assess the variables associated with gambling severity.Patients with GD exhibited more impaired scores than HCs in all the psychopathological dimensions investigated. More interestingly, gambling severity was significantly associated with metacognitive differentiation/decentration, difficulty in controlling impulses and non-acceptance of negative emotions.According to our results, the severity of gambling is associated with impaired metacognitive differentiation, high difficulty in controlling impulses and non-acceptance of negative emotions, and these findings can lead to new treatment implications. Interventions focused on metacognition and emotion regulation could help patients with GD to avoid maladaptive strategies such as behavioural addictions and, more specifically, to manage their own emotions. This type of treatment could help gamblers to become more aware of their internal state and learn strategies for adaptively managing emotions through functional metacognitive differentiation."
1796,"Energy production and trade openness: Assessing economic growth, CO2 emissions and the applicability of the cointegration analysis","Hdom, Helde A. D.; Fuinhas, Jose Alberto","The relationship between economic activities such as energy production, trade, and economic growth affects all areas of human life in terms of well-being, as well as a country's economic activities. In this study, we investigate these relationships using cointegration regression methods (FMOLS fully modified ordinary least square and DOLS dynamic ordinary least squares), we use the electricity production (hydro, natural gas and renewables), trade opening, GDP, and CO2 emissions to establish causality. We found that electricity generation, GDP and trade liberalization have both positive and negative effects on Brazil's economy. We also discovered a bidirectional causality between trade openness and all the energies produced in Brazil. Separately, we observed that GDP, hydropower, and renewables have negative effects on the CO2 emissions model, while only emissions of pollution and trade openness have positive effects on the economic growth model. These results have important policy implications for the Brazilian economy that does not support appropriate long-term sustainable development strategies. Consequently, policymakers should consider implementing appropriate management capacity to encourage the use of renewable energy and to benefit from the positive effects of economic growth and environmental policies to control the pollution rate through the potential of available natural resources. Our findings are not motivated by discrepancies or sample selection and survive multiple specifications, allowing to observe the relationship with great accuracy. Some diagnostic tests have been applied to show that it is not misleading."
1797,Comparative assessment of engine performance and emissions fueled with three different biodiesel generations,"Tayari, Sara; Abedi, Reza; Rahi, Abbas","Emissions from biodiesel combustion depend on types of feedstocks. This study investigated physicochemical properties of biodiesels in three various feedstocks generations and the effect of them on emissions and performance of the unmodified engine. Methyl esters from Eruca sativa (ES) which has crops with short production cycle and drought-tolerant capacity, waste cooking oil (WCO) as an economic feedstock, and microalgae Chlorella vulgaris (MCV) which have high growth rate and productivity without farmland requirement, were produced by transesterification process with methanol and KOH catalyst. Physicochemical properties of these biodiesels were determined by GC-MS and FTIR analysis and evaluated with ASTM D6751 standard. FAME components profile illustrated the high value of oleic acid (C18:1) in ES and WCO and long-chain fatty acids (C18:2 and higher) in MCV. The engine tests results indicated that MCV biodiesel produced slightly lower power and higher BSFC compared with others. There was a slight increase in NOx for MCV biodiesel compared with pure diesel. Conversely, ES and WCO biodiesels had a reduction in NOx. On the other hand, MCV biodiesel resulted in the greatest reduction in CO and HC emissions. Based on the results, MCV blends had the lowest emissions and the best function among all feedstocks.

Trichothecenes mycotoxins, produced by Fusarium fungus, are. among the most frequently found contaminants of wheat. In this study, we evaluated the production of trichothecenes Deoxynivalenol (DON), 3-acetyldeoxynivalenol (3-AcDON), 15-acetyldeoxynivalenol (15-AcDON), and nivalenol (NIV) by Fusarium meridionale, F. austroamericanum, and F. graminearum grown in wheat plants and rice medium. Fusarim meridionale was efficient only in the production of NIV (production range (pr) from 1340 to 2864 µg kg-1 in wheat plant), and F. austroamericanum in the production of 3-AcDON (pr from 50 to 192 µg kg-1 in wheat plant, and from 986 to 7045 µg kg-1 in rice medium) and DON (pr from 4076 to 13,701 µg kg-1 in wheat plant, and from 184 to 43,395 µg kg-1 in rice medium). Already, F. graminearum was efficient in the production of 3-AcDON only in rice medium (pr from 81 to 2342 µg kg-1), 15-AcDON in wheat plant (pr from 80 to 295 µg kg-1) and in rice medium (pr from 436 to 8597 µg kg-1), and DON also in wheat plant (pr from 7746 to 12,046 µg kg-1) and in rice medium (pr from 695 to 49,624 µg kg-1). The specificity of F. meridionale in the production of NIV but not the production of DON could generate a food security problem in regions where this species occurs and the amounts of NIV in grains and derivatives are not regulated in the food chain, as in Brazil."
1799,"Suitability of different precipitation data sources for hydrological analysis: a study from Western Ghats, India","Beeram Satya Narayana Reddy,Shahanas P V,S K Pramada,Beeram Satya Narayana Reddy,Shahanas P V,S K Pramada","For hydrological analysis, it is essential to have continuous and long-term precipitation data. However, the precipitation data from rain gauge stations are often insufficient and not continuous. At present, ground-based gridded data and satellite-based gridded data are often used as an alternative. However, these data sets have to be evaluated for their suitability in hydrological studies. The current study compared three different rainfall data sources with the observed station data for the Kallada River basin of Kerala, India. The ground-based gridded rainfall data from the India Meteorological Department (IMD), the high-resolution satellite product Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM 3B43, version 7), and the reanalysis data Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications (MERRA) are used in the analysis. The correlation coefficient, normalized root mean square error, Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency, modified index of agreement, and volumetric efficiency are used as performance indicators. The performance indicator's weights are based on the entropy method. The multi-criteria decision-making techniques like compromise programming and Preference Ranking Organization Method (PROMETHEE II) are used for ranking the precipitation data sources. It is found that IMD ground-based gridded data is ranked 1 among the three data sets. The IMD ground-based gridded data are not homogeneous based on the absolute homogeneity test, even though they had the highest rank. The IMD gridded data are further corrected based on double mass curve analysis. The corrected data were analyzed using the precipitation concentration index (PCI) to assess the temporal variation in precipitation, and it was found that the location falls under a uniform distribution zone."
1800,Hydroelectricity consumption forecast for Pakistan using ARIMA modeling and supply-demand analysis for the year 2030,"Jamil, Rehan","The amount of electricity generation and its availability to the residents of a country reflects its level of development and economic condition. Water being one of the cheapest and renewable sources of energy, is being used to produce one-quarter of the total electricity production in Pakistan. This article presents a forecasting study of hydroelectricity consumption in Pakistan based on the historical data of past 53 years using Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving-Average (ARIMA) modeling. Based on the developed forecasting equation, the hydroelectricity consumption was predicted up to the year 2030. For validating the reliability of the forecasted data, the results were compared to the actual values which showed good fit with minimum deviation. The forecasted values of hydroelectricity consumption revealed an average annual increment of 1.65% with a cumulative increase of 23.4% up to the year 2030. The results were compared with the hydroelectricity generation plans of the Government of Pakistan for its effectiveness. A sensitivity analysis was also performed to study the relation of hydroelectricity consumption to the annual population and GDP growth rate of the country. The research shall significantly prove to be useful in better planning and management of water resources of Pakistan for future. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."

We conducted a comprehensive survey of cytoplasmic ribosomal proteins (CRPs) in the dicot model Arabidopsis thaliana and the monocot model rice, noting that the standardized naming system has not been widely adopted in the plant community. We generated a database linking the old classical names to their updated and compliant names. We also explored the sequences, molecular evolution, and structural and functional characteristics of all plant CRP families, emphasizing evolutionarily conserved and plant-specific features through cross-kingdom comparisons. Unlike fungal CRP paralogs that were mainly created by whole-genome duplication (WGD) or retroposition under a concerted evolution mode, plant CRP genes evolved primarily through both WGD and tandem duplications in a rapid birth-and-death process. We also provide a web-based resource (http://www.plantcrp.cn/) with the aim of sharing the latest knowledge on plant CRPs and facilitating the continued development of a standardized framework across the entire community."

Conventional electron microscopy can provide detailed information about materials at these length scales, but direct imaging of light elements such as lithium presents a challenge. While several recent techniques allow lithium columns to be distinguished, these typically either involve complex contrast mechanisms that make image interpretation difficult or require significant expertise to perform. Here, we demonstrate how center-of-mass scanning transmission electron microscopy (CoM-STEM) provides an enhanced ability for simultaneous imaging of lithium and heavier element columns in lithium ion conductors. Through a combination of experiments and multislice electron scattering calculations, we show that CoM-STEM is straightforward to perform and produces directly interpretable contrast for thin samples, while being more robust to variations in experimental parameters than previously demonstrated techniques. As a result, CoM-STEM is positioned to become a reliable and facile method for directly probing all elements within energy storage materials at the atomic scale."

Little is known about the indoor environmental quality (IEQ) preferences and psychosocial comfort preferences of staff working from home. Therefore this study aimed to cluster office workers working at home based on their self-reported preferences for IEQ and psychosocial comfort at their most used workspace and to identify these preferences and needs of workers during the COVID-19 pandemic. A questionnaire was administered to employees of ten offices in the Netherlands, and the 502 respondents were clustered with two models by using TwoStep cluster analysis. The first model was based on variables related to IEQ preferences, while the second was to psychosocial comfort preferences. The analysis revealed four IEQ clusters and six psychosocial comfort clusters. Comparison of these results with other similar studies proposed that the prevalence of anxiety, depression, migraine, and rhinitis, increased for this population during the work-from-home period of the pandemic. Further results suggest that both IEQ and psychosocial comfort preferences are situation- and gender-dependent."
1804,Paths and strategies for sustainable urban renewal at the neighbourhood level: A framework for decision-making,"Huang, Lijie; Zheng, Wei; Hong, Jingke; Liu, Yong; Liu, Guiwen","With the rapid process of urbanisation in China, the challenges facing cities with regard to urban fabric, urban function, and human living conditions are enormous. Urban renewal provides opportunities to address these challenges and realise sustainable development. This study proposes a framework for integrating an indicator evaluation system and a decision-making matrix for urban renewal at the neighbourhood level in China; the level at which most development projects take place in a city. The indicator system covers subjective and objective evaluations on different aspects of neighbourhoods to shed light on specific problems and characteristics, namely, social aspects, economic aspects, environmental aspects, land use forms, building conditions, and facility conditions. The decision-making matrix is designed to provide implementation paths and corresponding strategies for urban renewal. The proposed framework was tested using a case study of eight neighbourhoods of Qixinggang, Yuzhong District, Chongqing in China. The results show the status quo and problems of the selected neighbourhoods and specific strategies to address these are subsequently proposed. Via in-depth investigations on various neighbourhoods within a city, decision-makers are capable of locating key areas and adjusting practical approaches from a 'one size fits all' approach to ones that are customised and offer small-scale improvements. The proposed framework can shed light on other empirical cities that possess similar local characteristics."

1806,"Oil Price, Energy Consumption, and CO2 Emissions in Turkey. New Evidence from a Bootstrap ARDL Test","Abumunshar, Mohammed; Aga, Mehmet; Samour, Ahmed","The main objective of this research was to test the effect of oil prices, renewable and non-renewable energy consumption, and economic growth on Turkey's carbon emissions by using three co-integration tests, namely, the newly-developed bootstrap autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) testing technique as proposed by (McNown et al., 2018); the new approach involving the Bayer-Hanck (2013) combined co-integration test; and the H-J (2008) co-integration technique, which induces two dates of structural breaks. The autoregressive distributed lag model (ARDL), dynamic ordinary least squares (DOLS), canonical cointegrating regression (CCR), and fully modified ordinary least square (FMOLS) approaches were utilized to test the long-run interaction between the examined variables. The Granger causality (GC) analysis was utilized to investigate the direction of causality among the variables. The long-run coefficients of ARDL, DOLS, CCR, and FMOLS showed that the oil prices had a negative influence on CO2 emissions in Turkey in the long run. Furthermore, the findings demonstrate that non-renewable energy, which includes oil, natural gas, and coal, increased CO2 emissions. In contrast, renewable energy can decrease the environmental pollution. These empirical findings can be attributed to the fact that Turkey is heavily dependent on imported oil; more than 50% of the energy requirement has been supplied by imports. Hence, oil price fluctuations have severe effects on the economic performance in Turkey, which in turn affects energy consumption and the level of carbon emissions. The study suggests that the rate of imported oil in Turkey must be decreased by finding more renewable energy sources for the energy supply formula to avoid any undesirable effects of oil price fluctuations on the CO2 emissions, and also to achieve sustainable development."
1807,"Spatio-temporal variations of ecosystem services in the urban agglomerations in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River, China","Dai, Xin; Wang, Lunche; Huang, Chunbo; Fang, Lulu; Wang, Shaoqiang; Wang, Lizhe","Increasing human activities have notably altered the compositions of global ecosystems, and consequently the services provided by them. As one of the most important economic functional areas in China, Urban Agglomerations in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River (UAMRYR) has undergone dramatic land use changes due to the rapid urbanization over recent decades. In this study, we utilized a revised proxy-based approach to evaluate ecosystem services value (ESV), applied the ecological contribution degree to quantify the response of ESV to land use change, coupled with RDA to explore the socioeconomic forces of ecosystem services. Our findings showed that land use activities were more intensive during 2010-2018 than that in 2000-2010. The total ESV decreased by $4.58 billion and most of the ecological functions exacerbated due to the expansion of built-up land and the reduction of cultivated land during 2010-2018. Besides, based on RDA result, park green land per capita, population density, and distance from the central city were estimated as the top three frontal factors affecting ESV; yet per capita water consumption was a negative one. Therefore, different development strategies should be adopted along the altitude gradient in UAMRYR. That is to emphasize the protection of permanent cultivated land and the diversification of land composition in low altitude areas, while ecological protection should be strengthened in higher areas. Understanding how ecosystem services respond to LUCC and socioeconomic drivers can help to enhance ecosystem functions and provide a theoretical basis for the construction of ecological civilization of UAMRYR, which may also be applied at the other urban agglomerations around the globe."
1808,"Air quality, health impacts and burden of disease due to air pollution (PM10, PM2.5, NO2 and O-3): Application of AirQ plus model to the Camp de Tarragona County (Catalonia, Spain)","Rovira, Joaquim; Domingo, Jose L.; Schuhmacher, Marta","The purpose of this study was to assess the impact to human health of air pollutants, through the integration of different technics: data statistics (spatial and temporal trends), population attributable fraction using AIRQ+ model developed by the WHO, and burden of disease using Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs). The levels of SO2, NO, NO2, O-3, H2S, benzene, PM10, PM2.5, CO, benzo(a)pyrene and metals, obtained between 2005 and 2017 from the air qualitymonitoring network across Camp de Tarragona County, were temporally and spatially determined. Health impacts were evaluated using the AIRQ+ model. Finally, the burden of disease was assessed through the calculation of Years of Lost life (YLL) and Years Lost due to Disability (YLD). In general terms, air quality was good according to European quality standards, but it did not fulfil the WHO guidelines, especially for O-3, PM10 and PM2.5. Several decreasing (NO, NO2, SO2, PM10 and benzene) and an increasing (O-3) temporal trend were found. Correlation between unemployment rate and air pollutant levels was found, pointing that the economic crisis (2008-2014) was a factor influencing the air pollutant levels. Reduction of air pollutant levels (PM2.5) to WHO guidelines in the Camp de Tarragona County would decrease the adult mortality between 23 and 297 cases per year, which means between 0.5 and 7% of all mortality in the area. In this County, for lung cancer, ischemic heart disease, stroke, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease due to levels of PM2.5 above the WHO threshold limits, DAYLs were 240 years. This means around 80 DALYs for 100,000 persons every year -between 2005 and 2017. Population attributable fraction (PAF) and burden of disease (DALYs) methodologies are suitable tools for regional and national policymakers, who must take decisions to prevent and to control air pollution and to analyse the cost-effectiveness of interventions.

It is an online, six-session class. The class was piloted in 2020-2021 with 55 autistic people who were ages 18-44 years old. This feasibility study found that most people who took the class liked it. Surveys filled out by the students before and after the class showed that they became less sensitive to rejection, used more positive thinking skills, and were more interested in being social. However, the class may not have made them feel less lonely. The team that invented the class is using the feedback to improve it.

Population data were derived from a health survey on a representative sample of 177 091 children aged 8-17 years. Dairy intake and dietary habits were evaluated using questionnaires (KIDMED index). Participants were characterised as 'dairy products consumers' based on whether they met current recommendations for milk or dairy consumption (e.g. if they consumed two yogurts and/or 40 g cheese and a cup of milk daily). Participants who did not consume the above-mentioned quantities were characterised as 'non-consumers.' Anthropometric and PF data were obtained by trained investigators. PA status, screen time and sleeping habits were assessed through self-completed questionnaires. Boys and girls consuming recommended dairy products were 25 % (95 % CI: 0·71, 0·79) and 43 % (95 % CI: 0·51, 0·64) less likely to have low performances in cardiorespiratory fitness tests, Participants from both sexes classified as dairy products consumers had lower odds of central obesity by 10 % (95 % CI: 0·86, 0·95), as compared with non-consumers. Moreover, recommended dairy products consumers had lower odds for insufficient sleep by 8 % (95 % CI: 0·89, 0·96) in boys and 14 % (95 % CI: 0·83-0·90) in girls, for inadequate PA levels by 15 % (95 % CI: 0·77, 0·93) in boys and 16 % (95 % CI: 0·76, 0·90) in girls and for increased screen time by 11 % (95 % CI: 0·83, 0·95) in boys and 9 % (95 % CI: 0·85, 0·97) in girls than no-consumers. In conclusion, recommended dairy intake is associated with less obesity, better PF and a healthier lifestyle profile."
1811,Does cognitive flexibility change the nature of the relationship between intolerance of uncertainty and psychological symptoms during the COVID-19 outbreak in Turkey?,"Mujgan Inozu,B Göktürk Gök,Duygu Tuzun,A Bikem Haciomeroglu,Mujgan Inozu,B Göktürk Gök,Duygu Tuzun,A Bikem Haciomeroglu","The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly affected the mental health of the general population worldwide. The study aimed to determine the associations of the intolerance of uncertainty (IU) and cognitive flexibility (CF) with a variety of psychological symptoms and to examine the impact of IU on psychological symptoms through the moderating role of CF. The Brief Symptom Inventory, Intolerance of Uncertainty Scale-12, and Cognitive Control and Flexibility Questionnaire were applied to a sample of 3004 adults living in Turkey. The results of the analysis indicated that CF moderated the effect of IU on psychology symptoms. The slope analysis revealed a weakening association between IU and psychological symptoms with the introduction of a high CF level introduced to the model. The findings highlighted the importance of IU as a potential risk factor for developing psychological symptoms while CF appears as a potential protective factor during the COVID-19 pandemic."

Parthanatos is a multistep cell death pathway cascade that involves poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP-1) overactivation, PAR accumulation, PAR binding to apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF), AIF release from the mitochondria, nuclear translocation of the AIF/macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) complex, and MIF-mediated large-scale DNA fragmentation. All the key players in the parthanatos pathway are pleiotropic proteins with diverse functions. An in-depth understanding of the structure-based activity of the key factors, and the biochemical mechanisms of parthanatos, is crucial for the development of drugs and therapeutic strategies. In this review, we delve into the key players of the parthanatos pathway and reveal the multiple levels of therapeutic opportunities for treating parthanatos-based pathogenesis."

In this study, we characterized the local cellular immune response in the brain, proventriculus, and small intestine of 27 cockatiels (Nymphicus hollandicus) experimentally infected with parrot bornavirus 2 (PaBV-2). Perivascular cuffs in the brain were composed of CD3+ T-lymphocytes and Iba1+ macrophages/microglia in most cockatiels (n = 26). In the ganglia of the proventriculus, CD3+ T-lymphocytes (n = 17) and Iba1+ macrophages (n = 13) prevailed. The ganglia of the small intestine had a more homogeneous distribution of these leukocytes, including PAX5+ B-lymphocytes (n = 9), CD3+ T-lymphocytes (n = 8), and Iba1+ macrophages (n = 8). Our results indicate that perivascular cuffs in the brain and the inflammatory infiltrate in the proventriculus of PaBV-2-infected cockatiels is predominately composed of T-lymphocytes, while the inflammatory infiltrates in the ganglia of the small intestine are characterized by a mixed infiltrate composed of T-lymphocytes, B-lymphocytes, and macrophages."
1814,Environmental justice and the SDGs: from synergies to gaps and contradictions,"Menton, Mary; Larrea, Carlos; Latorre, Sara; Martinez-Alier, Joan; Peck, Mika; Temper, Leah; Walter, Mariana","Through their synergies, trade-offs, and contradictions, the sustainable development goals (SDGs) have the potential to lead to environmental justices and injustices. Yet, environmental justice (EJ), and social justice more broadly, are not currently embedded within the language and spirit of the SDGs. We part from the premise that ""many 'environmental' problems are, by their very nature, problems of justice"" (Lele, Wiley Interdiscip Rev Water 4:e1224, 2017). We review progress in EJ frameworks in recent years, arguing for the need to move beyond a focus on the four principles of mainstream EJ (distribution, procedure, recognition, and capabilities) towards a more intersectional decolonial approach to environmental justice that recognises the indispensability of both humans and non-humans. EJ frameworks, and the SDGs should recognise power dynamics, complex interactions among injustices, and listens to the different 'senses of justice' and desires of theorists, activists, and other stakeholder from the Global South. We analyze how EJ frameworks are, or fail to be, incorporated in the SDGs with a focus on the food-water-health nexus (SDG2, 3, 6); climate-energy (SDG7, 13), conservation (SDG14, 15); and poverty and inequality (SDG1, 10). We call attention to the 'elephant in the room'-the failure to go beyond GDP but instead include economic growth as a goal (SDG8). We argue that sustainable degrowth and intersectional decolonial environmental justices would create better conditions for the transformative changes needed to reach the broader aim of the SDGs: to leave no one behind."
1815,How do single-family homeowners value residential and commercial density? It depends,"Arthur Acolin,Gregg Colburn,Rebecca Walter,Arthur Acolin,Gregg Colburn,Rebecca Walter","This paper develops estimates of the relationship between local density and single-family home values across five U.S. metropolitan areas using 2017 transactions in Chicago, Los Angeles, Minneapolis, Philadelphia, Seattle. Proposals to build new commercial and residential development projects that would increase local density commonly face opposition from local homeowners. Academic literature links the response from homeowners to concerns that higher density is associated with lower property values but there is limited empirical evidence establishing this relationship at the local level. We find a positive and significant relationship between density and house value in the core area of the five metropolitan regions we analyze. For outlying areas, the estimates are smaller and even negative in several cases. We instrument density based on topographic and soil characteristics and find similar results. These findings point to the need for a more nuanced discussion of the relationship between local density and housing values."
1816,The determinants of environmental quality in the SAARC region: a spatial heterogeneous panel data approach,"Khalid, Khaizran; Usman, Muhammad; Mehdi, Muhammad Abuzar","In recent years, financial development, trade policies, and energy performance have attracted attention due to their behavior on environmental quality. Therefore, the current study examines the impact of financial development, trade openness, primary and renewable energy utilization, and economic growth on the ecological footprint in South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) countries from 1990 to 2017. This article progresses the proficiency of financial development by utilizing the comprehensive and multidimensional index of financial sector development based on their depth, access, and efficiency of their financial institutions and markets. In order to estimate the robust results, this study employed the cross-sectional dependency tests that allow the second-generation unit root, Westerlund cointegration, augmented mean group (AMG), error correction model (ECM), and Dumitrescu-Hurlin (D-H) panel non-causality tests. The results revealed a very weak effect of financial development in a panel of SAARC countries, while country-specific results reveal that financial development significantly enhances the pollution level in the case of Bangladesh and Sri Lanka. However, it improves the environmental quality in Nepal. Furthermore, trade openness only improves the environmental quality in the case of Nepal. Additionally, the findings explore that primary energy consumption enhances the ecological footprint in Bangladesh, Nepal, and Sri Lanka and reduces in case of Bhutan. On the contrary, renewable energy consumption significantly improves the environmental quality in all countries except Bangladesh. Finally, consistent with these findings, a number of suitable policy implications are expressed in the angle of SAARC economies."

Furthermore, resveratrol and vitamin C nearly normalized these effects in lung histoarchitecture. &lt;b&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/b&gt; The obtained biochemical, molecular biology and histological results of this study proved the lung protective activity of resveratrol against B[a]P induced lung toxicity in rats."
1818,Environmental impact of biogenic silver nanoparticles in soil and aquatic organisms,"Ottoni, C. A.; Lima Neto, M. C.; Leo, P.; Ortolan, B. D.; Barbieri, E.; De Souza, A. O.","Synthetic silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) are being extensively used in our daily lives; however, they may also pose a risk to public health and environment. Nowadays, biological AgNPs are considered an excellent alternative, since their synthesis occurs by a green technology of low cost and easy scaling. However, studies with these biological nanomaterials (NM) are still limited. Thus, a more careful assessment of their industrial application, economic feasibility and ecotoxicological impacts is crucial. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of different concentrations of mangrove fungus Aspergillus tubingensis AgNPs on the aerobic heterotrophs soil microorganisms, rice seeds (Oryza sativa) and zebrafish (Danio rerio). Biogenic AgNPs were less harmful for soil microbiota compared to AgNO3. On rice seeds, the AgNPs displayed a dose-dependent inhibitory effect on germination and their subsequent growth and development. The percentage of inhibition of rice seed germination was 30, 69 and 80% for 0.01, 0.1 and 0.5 mM AgNPs, respectively. After 24 h of AgNPs exposition at a limit concentration of 0.2 mM, it did not induce mortality of the zebrafish D. rerio. Overall, A. tubingensis AgNPs can be considered as a suitable alternative to synthetic nanoparticles. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."
1819,Exploring the convergence patterns of PM2.5 in Chinese cities,"Yan Wang,Yuan Gong,Caiquan Bai,Hong Yan,Xing Yi,Yan Wang,Yuan Gong,Caiquan Bai,Hong Yan,Xing Yi","Economic development and ongoing urbanization are usually accompanied by severe haze pollution. Revealing the spatial and temporal evolution of haze pollution can provide a powerful tool for formulating sustainable development policies. Previous studies mostly discuss the differences in the level of PM2.5 among regions, but have paid little attention to the change rules of such differences and their clustering patterns over long periods. Therefore, from the perspective of club convergence, this study employs the log t regression test and club clustering algorithm proposed by Phillips and Sul (Econometrica 75(6):1771-1855, 2007. 10.1111/j.1468-0262.2007.00811.x) to empirically examine the convergence characteristics of PM2.5 concentrations in Chinese cities from 1998 to 2016. This study found that there was no evidence of full panel convergence, but supported one divergent group and eleven convergence clubs with large differences in mean PM2.5 concentrations and growth rates. The geographical distribution of these clubs showed significant spatial dependence. In addition, certain meteorological and socio-economic factors predominantly determined the convergence club for each city."
1820,"The role of tourism, transportation and globalization in testing environmental Kuznets curve in Malaysia: new insights from quantile ARDL approach","Sharif, Arshian; Afshan, Sahar; Chrea, Sesokunthideth; Amel, Aguir; Khan, Syed Abdul Rehman","This paper uses the quantile autoregressive distributed lag (QARDL) model to analyze the impact of economic growth, tourism, transportation, and globalization on carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions in the Malaysian economy. The QARDL model is employed utilizing quarterly data from 1995Q1 to 2018Q4. The results demonstrate that economic growth is significantly positive with CO2 emissions at lower to upper quantiles. Interestingly, tourism has a negative effect on CO2 emissions at higher quantiles. Moreover, globalization and transportation services are positive, with CO2 emissions at upper-middle to higher quantiles. Furthermore, we tested the environmental Kuznets curve, and the outcomes confirm the presence of the inverted U-shaped curve in the Malaysian economy. The results of this study suggest that ecotourism is beneficial for economic growth in underdeveloped areas; it increases employment opportunities and, thus, achieves a win-win situation for protection and development. The government should encourage the low-carbon development of ecotourism and achieve green development of both tourism and the economy."

Here, we report an A-site cation-deficient La0.4Sr0.55Co0.2Fe0.6Nb0.2O3-delta (LSCFN55) perovskite is such a hydrogen electrode for SOEC, exhibiting a high electrolysis current density of 0.956 A/cm(2) with an applied voltage of 1.3 V at 850 degrees C and good stability in a high humidity and hydrogen partial pressure environment. The introduction of A-site cation deficiency into the perovskite oxide lattice of LSCFN55 promotes the exsolution of partial cobalt and iron from the oxide bulk with the formation of Co-2 Fe alloy nanoparticles that decorate the surface of perovskite main phase, simultaneously SrO is segregated to form nanocomposites with the alloy. The outstanding electrocatalytic activity of alloy nanoparticles, the favorable water adsorption capability of SrO, the high oxygen-ion conductivity of the perovskite main phase, and the improved electronic conductivity of the material, cooperatively contribute to the superior performance of the electrode. The strong interaction between the alloy nanoparticles and the perovskite substrate effectively suppresses the sintering of the nanoparticles while the SrO phase protects the alloy nanoparticles from oxidation, both then contribute to the high operating stability of the electrode.

The data were obtained for the period from 1995Q1 to 2018Q4. In the long run, GDP and institutional quality have a positive impact on CO2 emission when this emission is already high, which shows that if the GDP and institutional quality increases, the CO2 emission also increases. Moreover, financial development and ICT has a negative impact on CO2 emission irrespective of emission level that whether it is high or low in the country, which shows that if financial enhancement and ICT increases, carbon emission decreases. The study also supported the EKC hypothesis in Pakistan."
1823,Recent progress in the pig-to-nonhuman primate kidney transplantation model: Report of a symposium,"David K C Cooper,David K C Cooper","Three excellent presentations at an industry-sponsored symposium at the (virtual) congress of the combined IXA/CTRMS (September 23-25, 2021) were directed to the value and limitations of the pig-to-nonhuman primate (NHP) kidney transplantation model. Daniel Firl and James Markmann provided a meta-analysis comparing the results of kidney allotransplantation and xenotransplantation in NHPs during the past 25 years. Remarkably, the authors had identified 73 published reports that included 910 individual experiments. Although recipient survival after allotransplantation was longer, the superiority over the survival of xenografts was less than anticipated. Given the excellent short- and medium-term results of clinical kidney allotransplantation today, these data provide hope that the results of clinical pig kidney xenotransplantation may prove significantly better than in NHPs. The authors identified several factors that were shown to statistically influence the success or failure of xenotransplantation. Jean Kwun provided valuable information relating to the longstanding question of whether the survival of a pig organ would be jeopardized if transplanted into an allosensitized recipient. He demonstrated that pig kidney transplantation in an HLA-sensitized patient may be at a disadvantage, although multiple genetic engineering of the organ-source pig significantly delayed rejection. In the initial clinical trials, therefore, it would seem wise to exclude any patient with evidence of anti-HLA antibodies. Andrew Adams reported longer survival (>1 year) of Rhesus monkeys with life-supporting pig kidney grafts than has been achieved previously. Although not consistently achieved, these excellent results were obtained with an anti-CD154mAb-based regimen after CD4+ T cell and partial CD20+ B cell depletion. Factors that might have contributed to this success, including the phenotype of the pig, the species of the recipient, the recipient's anti-pig antibody level, and the immunosuppressive regimen, were discussed. Importantly, pig kidney function appeared to be normal in long-term surviving monkeys. Each study contributed to our goal of introducing xenotransplantation into the clinic."
1824,"Carbon emission effect of energy transition and globalization: inference from the low-, lower middle-, upper middle-, and high-income economies","Alola, Andrew Adewale; Joshua, Udi","The importance of income to environmental sustainability especially in the perspective of economic development has been rigorously examined in recent times. To further deepened the income-environmental sustainability narrative, the current study explore the cases of income-classified countries vis-a-vis the high-income, low-income, lower middle-income, and the upper middle-income countries and territories. As such, the current study examined the impact of renewable energy and fossil fuel energy consumption and globalization on CO(2)emissions over the period of 1970 to 2014 for the case of (1) the panel of income-classified countries and territories and (2) the time series of each of the income-classification. By employing the Pooled Mean Group of the Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) approach, the study found that fossil fuel consumption in the panel of examined income classification aggravates environmental hazards in both the short-long run, while the share of renewable energy usage improves the environmental quality only in the short run. Like the renewable energy consumption, globalization exacts negative and positive impacts in the short run and long run, respectively. From the second (time series) approach, the study found that fossil fuel energy worsen the environment in each of the fours income-categorized economies. Similarly, renewable energy usage exerts a significant and desirable impact on the environment in all but one (lower middle income) of the four income-categorized economies. However, globalization observably plays a significant and desirable role only in the lower middle-income economies. Hence, the study posits policy guide in the context of increased diversification of energy portfolio for each of the four income-categorized countries and territories especially the lower middle-income economies."
1825,Measuring and modeling energy resilience,"Gatto, Andrea; Drago, Carlo","Resilience is a hot topic within the international development agenda and Sustainable Development Goals. Nowadays, resilience plays a crucial role in improving the quality of life of vulnerable categories and is designed as a major strategy to face the diverse dimensions and dynamics of vulnerability. Energy results among the most relevant fields of applications of resilience policies, especially when it comes to electricity. As a multidimensional concept, energy resilience policies must relate to the dimensions of sustainability - here considered as the interplay between the economic, social, environmental and governance dimensions. Due to the complexity of the phenomenon, energy resilience can be effectively outlined making use of composite indicators techniques. This paper presents the following new results: i) energy resilience is defined and ranked, strengthening a composite indicator for both OECD and non-OECD countries; the determinants of energy resilience are investigated; ii) an innovation on the construction of the World Bank's Regulatory Indicators on Sustainable Energy is operated. Our exercise makes use of an approach based on interval data to assess the sensitivity of the measure from different specifications. For the same scope, the robustness of the ranks obtained is analyzed through an uncertainty analysis. These choices aim to enhance the soundness and the validity of the composite indicator. The methodology provides a more reliable baseline to validate the results and the conceptual assumptions undertaken. It is found that, according to the diverse theoretical frameworks and methodologies applied, some countries vary considerably both in the pillars that aggregate the variables and within the minima, the centers, and the maxima of the intervals."
1826,Estimating environmental efficiency and convergence: 1980 to 2016,"Sun, Huaping; Kporsu, Anthony Kwaku; Taghizadeh-Hesary, Farhad; Edziah, Bless Kofi","Environmental performance assessment has been on the forefront of global economic growth discussions for the past decades. The study of efficiency growth and convergence is important to enable countries to evaluate their uses of inputs and embrace technologies to increase productivity. Using the Malmquist-Luenberger productivity index, this paper investigated the environmental performance of a panel of 104 countries over the period 1980 to 2016. Absolute and conditional beta convergence was analyzed and the possibility of clustering based on the club convergence was also analyzed. The findings show that average global environmental efficiency growth over the period is 1.3%. Convergence in environmental growth is conditional on industrial structure, globalization and energy price. The results also indicate the formation of club clusters in a sub sample of every decade but not in the entire period of study. Policy implications are also suggested. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

High-fat diet given over 3 weeks before intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin in a dose of 40 mg/kg promoted the appearance of hyperglycemia in Wistar rats. The biochemical analysis of blood serum revealed increased levels of urea, triglycerides, cholesterol, AST, ALT, and concentration of inorganic phosphates and K+ ions in the high-fat diet group in comparison with the control. Both the biochemical analysis of the blood and histological analysis showed more pronounced abnormalities in rats receiving high-fat diet in comparison with animals receiving standard ration. These changes are the early markers for the development of nephropathy, impaired liver function, and microvascular disorders typical of patients with diabetes mellitus."
1828,"Protective role of scutellarin on LPS induced - Acute lung injury and regulation of apoptosis, oxidative stress and reduction of mitochondrial dysfunction","Daosheng Fan,Deng Wang,Lihuan Zhu,Daosheng Fan,Deng Wang,Lihuan Zhu","Lung fluid accumulation was determined using wet/dry lung mass ratio. Rats subjected to LPS-induced acute lung injury (2.8 ± 0.33, P < 0.05) presented with a significantly higher wet to dry lung weight ration ratio than sham rats (1.6 ± 0.23, P < 0.05). These results demonstrate that acutely inured rats' lungs were oedematous. On the other hand, treatment with scutellarin alone and in combination with a JNK inhibitor, SP600125, both significantly attenuated pulmonary edema as shown via reduced wet/dry lung mass ratios (1.7 ± 0.09 and 1.8 ± 0.23; P < 0.05, respectively). These results showed that the interventions were effective against LPS-induced edema of the lungs. However, the difference between treatment groups' weight ratios was not statistically significant (P > 0.05). In the sham control rats, the levels of ROS and SOD production were maintained at a low and at a high concentration, respectively (P < 0.05). However, following LPS infusion, the ROS levels skyrocketed while that of SOD decreased significantly relative to the control rats (P < 0.05). Furthermore, we noted that pre-treatment with scutellarin reduced the ROS levels in LPS-injured rats while the SOD was increased to near control levels (P < 0.05). Moreover, the combined effect of scutellarin and JNK inhibitor SP600125 on the levels of ROS and the SOD activity followed a similar trend to that of scutellarin alone albeit with a lower magnitude of change. Our results also showed that the combinatorial treatment was not significantly different from scutellarin alone in terms of influence on the levels of ROS production and SOD activity (P > 0.05). The effect of Scutellarin on broncho-alveolar lavage fluid (BALF) cytokine secretion The expression of interleukins-1β, -18 and -6 in the broncho-alveolar lavage fluid were significantly upregulated by LPS infusion (P < 0.05). The rise was, however, attenuated via pre-treatment with scutellarin only or in conjunction with SP600125, a JNK inhibitor (all P < 0.05). On the contrary, we observed that LPS injection caused a reduction of interlekins -4 and -10 secreted in the BALF. Pre-treatment with scutellarin alone (P < 0.05) and not in combination with SP600125 or SP600125 was able to significantly reverse this noted down-regulation (all P > 0.05)."

A systematic literature search in PubMed and Google Scholar database was done from 2010 to 2020 on the topic ""thoracolumbar fracture AND radiology AND surgical outcomes"" and ""thoracolumbar fracture AND radiology AND surgical outcomes."" A total of 58 papers were analyzed and WFNS (World Federation of Neurosurgical Societies) Spine Committee organized 2 consensus meetings to formulate the specific recommendations the first in Peshawar in December 2019 and in a subsequent virtual meeting in June 2020 to reach an agreement. Both meetings utilized the Delphi method to analyze preliminary literature review statements based on the current evidence levels to generate recommendations through a comprehensive voting session. Eight statements were presented and reached the consensus about this topic. A variety of clinical factors is known to influence outcome of patients with thoracolumbar fractures. Some of these are well-known established factors such as blood pressure augmentation and patient age, while some are not well studied. Overall, the quality of evidence is low and we need more randomized controlled studies to validate our results. Similarly, radiological factors that can predict outcome are well stated and there is a high accordance worldwide. In reverse, still under debate is the application to choose which surgical treatment is advisable based on them."
1830,"Comparative analysis of drivers of energy consumption in China, the USA and India - A perspective from stratified heterogeneity","Wang, Qiang; Jiang, Xue-ting; Yang, Xue; Ge, Shuting","With the limited amount of resources, developing effective strategies to make full use of them and decrease the energy consumption without too much sacrifice of economic output requires identifying key drivers of energy consumption growth rate as a prerequisite. Meanwhile, as top three consumers of primary energy of the world, China, the United States of America, and India burn over 45% of global fuels in 2016. Conducting an empirically comparative analysis of them can also set up pilot scheme for other economies to develop more efficient strategies for energy consumption. The paper modified the original Geographical Detector model with a different sampling method to detect the key driver of energy consumption growth rate, which filling the gap that there are possible interactions of potential factors. The results show that coal intensity is the biggest driver to change overall energy consumption growth rate in China and India. In comparison, for the United States, the leading drivers of energy use are the factors of individual incomes and oil intensity. In addition, all factors have interactions and enhance each other when influencing total energy consumption growth rate. India has the strongest factor interactions when influencing the energy consumption growth rate among the three economies, all interactions between factors in US is not significant as those in China and India.

1831,Prediction of chlorophenols adsorption on activated carbons by representative pores method,"José Carlos Alexandre de Oliveira,Paulo Ricardo Moura Rodrigues,Sebastião Mardônio Pereira de Lucena,José Carlos Alexandre de Oliveira,Paulo Ricardo Moura Rodrigues,Sebastião Mardônio Pereira de Lucena","The specification of a particular activated carbon adsorbents for removal of phenol and related derivatives, from dilute aqueous solutions, is still based on lengthy trial and error experimental tests. A predictive model of adsorption of these compounds would considerably reduce the carbon selection time and could also bring new information to support more efficient carbon synthesis. The use of molecular simulation and the methodology of representative pores proved to be adequate for quantitative prediction of phenol adsorption. Here the methodology is being extended to chlorophenols, an important class of phenol-derived pollutants. A set of ortho- and para-chlorophenol isotherms were simulated for different representative pores in order to predict carbon adsorption and determine the most significative pore size. At low concentrations (1 × 10-4 mol/L), the pores of 8.9 and 18.5 Å are the most effective. For concentrations above 3 × 10-4 mol/L, pores in the range of 27.9 Å must be present in the activated carbon. The simulation predicts a step for the 27.9 Å pore that can be correlated with experimental steps in literature. Finally, the adsorption isotherms of chlorophenols for other activated carbons were predicted with the help of the model."
1832,"Urban heat stress and human health in Bangkok, Thailand","Arifwidodo, Sigit D.; Chandrasiri, Orana","Heat stress has been recognized as one of the consequences of climate change in urban areas. Its adverse effects on the urban population range from economy, social, environment, and human health. With the increasing urbanization and economic development in cities, heat stress is expected to worsen. This particular study aims to achieve two objectives: (1) to understand the determinants of heat stress, especially the roles of the urban environment in exacerbating the heat stress, and (2) to explore the effects of heat stress to human health using self-reported health assessment. We employed a cross-sectional study using a survey questionnaire from 505 respondents living in the urban area of Bangkok, Thailand. We found that socioeconomic conditions of the individual and urban environment were significant determinants of urban heat stress. Low-income urban populations living in high-density areas with less green open space were more likely to experience heat stress. We also found that heat stress significantly affects human health. Those who reported a higher level of heat stress were more likely to have adverse health and well-being outcomes. The findings suggest that the increased risk of heat stress represents a major problem in the Bangkok, Thailand. It is necessary to address heat stress in adaptation policy and measures at the city levels amid the continued increase of global temperature and climate change."
1833,Antiplatelet therapy in cardiovascular disease: Current status and future directions,"Gabriella Passacquale,Pankaj Sharma,Divaka Perera,Albert Ferro,Gabriella Passacquale,Pankaj Sharma,Divaka Perera,Albert Ferro","Antiplatelet medications remain a cornerstone of therapy for atherosclerotic cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases. In primary prevention (patients with cardiovascular risk factors but no documented events, symptoms or angiographic disease), there is little evidence of benefit of any antiplatelet therapy, and such therapy carries the risk of excess bleeding. Where there is documented disease (secondary prevention), stable patients benefit from long-term antiplatelet monotherapy, aspirin being first choice in those with coronary heart disease and clopidogrel in those with cerebrovascular disease; moreover, recent evidence shows that low-dose rivaroxaban in combination with aspirin confers added benefit, in patients with stable cardiovascular and peripheral arterial disease. In patients with acute cerebrovascular disease, aspirin combined with clopidogrel reduces subsequent risk, while in acute coronary syndrome, dual antiplatelet therapy comprising aspirin and a P2Y12 inhibitor (clopidogrel, prasugrel or ticagrelor) confers greater protection than aspirin monotherapy, with prasugrel and ticagrelor offering greater antiplatelet efficacy with faster onset of action than clopidogrel. Although greater antiplatelet efficacy is advantageous in preventing thrombotic events, this must be tempered by increased risk of bleeding, which may be a particular issue in certain patient groups, as will be discussed. We will also discuss possible future approaches to personalisation of antiplatelet therapy."
1834,Morphological and immunohistochemical characterization and molecular classification of spontaneous mammary gland tumors in macropods,"Tu Chun Hsu,Michael M Garner,Matti Kiupel,Tu Chun Hsu,Michael M Garner,Matti Kiupel","Mammary gland neoplasms in macropods are uncommonly reported, and the morphological and immunohistochemical characteristics are incompletely described. The goal of this study was to describe the morphologic features of macropod mammary neoplasms and to determine the molecular subtypes of mammary carcinomas using a panel of antibodies against estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (Her-2), p63, smooth muscle actin (SMA), and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Biopsy and necropsy specimens were examined from 21 macropods with mammary tumors submitted to Northwest ZooPath from 1996 to 2019. In accordance with the histologic classification of canine mammary tumors proposed by Goldschmidt and colleagues, tubulopapillary (2), tubular (10), and comedo-carcinomas (2), adenoma (1), lobular hyperplasia (3), fibroadenomatous hyperplasia (1), and mastitis (2) were diagnosed. Red kangaroos (Osphranter rufus) were most commonly diagnosed with mammary carcinomas (79% of all carcinomas). Seven carcinomas had lymphovascular invasion and 2 also had pulmonary metastases. Six of these 7 carcinomas were classified as grade 3. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) for all antibodies was performed on 9/14 carcinomas, and partial IHC was performed for 3 cases. All 12 carcinomas were immunoreactive for PR, 5 for ER, 9 for EGFR, and none for Her-2. Five of the 9 mammary carcinomas with complete IHC data were classified as luminal A subtype, and 4 were normal-like subtype. Accurate classification of mammary tumors in macropods based on morphology, immunohistological characteristics, and molecular subtype may be helpful in guiding clinical management, prognosis, and potential therapeutic targets."
1835,[Effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on health inequalities and mental health: effective public policies],"Roberto De Vogli,Maria Diletta Buio,Rossella De Falco,Roberto De Vogli,Maria Diletta Buio,Rossella De Falco","The aim of this article is to examine the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on health inequalities and mental disorders and to analyse the most effective public policies in containing them. COVID-19, in addition to causing the worst health crisis since World War II, has generated a severe economic recession and a rise in unemployment. The poorer socioeconomic classes have been most affected by infections and deaths caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus due to inequalities in working, housing and area of ​​residence conditions, psychosocial factors, and unequal access to health care. The pandemic crisis, in addition to causing psychiatric and neurological problems in people who have been hospitalized, appears to have increased the risk of psychological problems through various mechanisms such as social distancing, loss of a loved one, unemployment, and economic difficulties. In many countries, however, there was no significant increase in suicides in 2020 and there have even been decreasing temporal trends. It is possible that the crisis, in addition to creating stress and social isolation, may have promoted reciprocity, interpersonal help, and greater motivation to take care of one's health.The most effective policies in reducing COVID-19 mortality have the potential to limit the most adverse effects of the pandemic on health inequalities and mental health. Thanks to vigorous preventive interventions on the territory, based on testing, tracing, isolating, timely, countries who managed best the pandemic avoided prolonged and repeated lockdowns, protected public health and the economy. However, more vigorous social protection measures are needed in favour of those populations most affected by the health crisis and its socioeconomic effects. This pandemic offers the opportunity to learn lessons on the protection of public health and stress the need to adopt a syndemic model oriented towards prevention."

Feasibility investigation of the recommended system is studied based on thermodynamic and thermoeconomic balance equations for performance assessment of thermal systems. the energy efficiency, exergy efficiency, and overall unit product cost are computed 49.83%, 27.68%, and 198.3 $/GJ, respectively. Also, condenser 2 is characterized as the main contributor to irreversibility of the recommended trigeneration system by exergy destruction ratio of 32.03%. Moreover, a thorough sensitivity study is carried out to attain higher energy efficiency by raising the evaporation temperature and basic NH3 concentration or by reducing the separators pressure, heating unit temperature, and terminal temperature difference (TTD) of vapour generator. From exergy perspective, it is figured out that higher exergy efficiency may be achieved by raising the separator 1 pressure, and TTD of vapour generator or by reducing the separator 2 pressure, evaporation temperature, heating unit temperature, and basic NH3 concentration. Also, it is proven that the overall cost of the cycle can be peaked with evaporation temperature, while can be maximized with separator 1 pressure and basic ammonia concentration.

1837,"Role of the Neurons, Astrocytes and Particle-Wave Duality in Conventional Electromagnetic Field, Plasma Brain Dynamics and Quantum Brain Dynamics","Zamzuri Idris,Zaitun Zakaria,Jafri Malin Abdullah,Zamzuri Idris,Zaitun Zakaria,Jafri Malin Abdullah","The brain is regarded as the most complex anatomical structure in the human body that executes various functions. The electromagnetic brainwaves or energy with its discrete network is commonly thought of as the sole contributor to various brain functions. However, the discrete pattern of the brain network seems insufficient to explain consciousness, binding problems in neural communication, brain heat, psychiatric manifestations and higher-order of thinking. Therefore, it seems that the brain must possess additional energy for it to have a much higher degree of functional freedom. Plasma brain dynamics (PBD) and quantum brain dynamics (QBD) are two hypothetical brain energies that have a strong scientific basis to exist together with the conventional brain electromagnetic energy. The presence of these energies may explain the puzzling brain functions, thus creating an opportunity to correct any abnormalities arising from them."
1838,"Power-to-methane, coupling CO2 capture with fuel production: An overview","Hidalgo, D.; Martin-Marroquin, J. M.","This paper provides a revision of the latest studies on the topic methanation, a multi-stage process where water is first converted into hydrogen in an electrolyzer, which subsequently reacts with carbon dioxide to produce methane. The present and future of the most common water electrolysis technologies is addressed. Critical issues to take into consideration when selecting a carbon dioxide source are evaluated. Chemical and biological approaches, together with photocatalytic configurations are discussed, analyzing pros and cons in all the cases. This paper also highlights the extensive work being done in the development of catalysts capable of selectively converting carbon dioxide into methane, as well as the different reactor configurations that can be used with this aim in any of the available methanation modalities. Relevant power-to-methane plants in Europe have been identified and assessed regarding their location, year of commissioning, capacity, technology for electrolysis and methanation type. Finally, cost issues are analyzed, highlighting economic perspectives of the power-to-methane technologies for the next decades. This document reviews all the key elements associated with the methanation process, revealing which aspects can pave the way for the large-scale implementation of this power generation model. In this sense, the gradual cost reduction of the equipment involved and the continuous increase in the efficiency of the processes are revealed as crucial aspects that can lead to a general implementation of the methanation concept on the way to a low carbon economy."
1839,BIM-based techno-economic assessment of energy retrofitting residential buildings in hot humid climate,"Ahmed, Wahhaj; Asif, Muhammad","Buildings in hot humid climates are energy intensive to operate. Energy consumption in Saudi Arabia is almost three times higher than the global average, and one of the major contributors to that is the residential sector. Increasing environmental and economic concerns, in the form of Saudi Vision 2030, mean that the existing unsustainable residential building stock has to be energy retrofitted. This study examines the techno-economic feasibility of retrofitting existing homes in Eastern Province, Saudi Arabia. A Building Information Modelling (BIM)-based retrofit framework has been adopted and investigated on two case studies. Eight Energy Efficiency Measures (EEMs) have been implemented including increasing cooling set point temperature, using energy efficient appliances, replacing conventional lights with more efficient lights, applying window shading, improving glazing type, improving air tightness, using more efficient air conditioning system, and adding envelope insulation. A three-level energy retrofit plan is proposed. Results indicate that annual energy consumption in a villa is reduced by 13.79%, 19.27% and 56.9%, and in the apartment building by 22.84%, 28.85% and 58.5% through a level 1, 2 and 3 retrofit respectively. Compound Payback Period (CPP) was computed to assess the economic viability. For the villa, investing in a level 1, 2 and 3 retrofit will pay back in 0.92, 8.37 and 25.15 years respectively, while for the apartment building, the payback period is 0.60, 11.28 and 24.60 years respectively. Thus, energy retrofitting of existing homes has the potential to significantly reduce energy consumption, however, it is economically not viable in the existing scenario. Electricity tariffs need to be further increased and coupled with incentive programs to render deep energy retrofits feasible. Furthermore, the investigated BIM-based approach can be adopted to investigate energy retrofitting in other climate zones of Saudi Arabia and other countries in the region, and eventually be adopted to efficiently effectuate the colossal task of retrofitting the whole existing residential building stocks of these countries.

1840,"Climate change vulnerability, water resources and social implications in North Africa","Schilling, Janpeter; Hertig, Elke; Tramblay, Yves; Scheffran, Juergen","North Africa is considered a climate change hot spot. Existing studies either focus on the physical aspects of climate change or discuss the social ones. The present article aims to address this divide by assessing and comparing the climate change vulnerability of Algeria, Egypt, Libya, Morocco, and Tunisia and linking it to its social implications. The vulnerability assessment focuses on climate change exposure, water resources, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity. The results suggest that all countries are exposed to strong temperature increases and a high drought risk under climate change. Algeria is most vulnerable to climate change, mainly due to the country's high sensitivity. Across North Africa, the combination of climate change and strong population growth is very likely to further aggravate the already scarce water situation. The so-called Arab Spring has shown that social unrest is partly caused by unmet basic needs of the population for food and water. Thus, climate change may become an indirect driver of social instability in North Africa. To mitigate the impact of climate change, it is important to reduce economic and livelihood dependence on rain-fed agriculture, strengthen sustainable land use practices, and increase the adaptive capacity. Further, increased regional cooperation and sub-national vulnerability assessments are needed."
1841,The concept of the invisible radiologist in the era of artificial intelligence,"Apostolos H Karantanas,Stavros Efremidis,Apostolos H Karantanas,Stavros Efremidis","The radiologists were traditionally working in the background. What upgraded them as physicians during the second half of the past century was their clinical training and function precipitated by the evolution of Interventional Radiology and Medical Imaging, especially with ultrasonography. These allowed them to participate in patient's diagnosis and treatment by direct contact as well asvia multidisciplinary medical consultations. The wide application of teleradiology and PACS pushed radiologists back again which is no longer acceptable, especially in view of the amazing applications of artificial intelligence (AI) in Radiology. It is our belief that clinical radiologists have to be able to control the penetration of AI in Radiology, securing their work for the benefit of both clinicians and patients."

This study aimed at assessing those indicators before and after the beginning of the pandemic in France. In this retrospective cohort study, we collected prospectively the clinical data of the 11.4 million of patients referred to the Greater Paris University Hospitals (AP-HP). We identified new CRC cases between 1 January 2018 and 31 December 2020, and compared indicators for 2018-2019 to 2020. pTNM tumor stage was extracted from postoperative pathology reports for localized colon cancer, and metastatic status was extracted from CT-scan baseline text reports. Between 2018 and 2020, 3602 and 1083 new colon and rectal cancers were referred to the AP-HP, respectively. The 1-year OS rates reached 94%, 93% and 76% for new CRC patients undergoing a resection of the primary tumor, in 2018-2019, in 2020 without any Sars-Cov2 infection and in 2020 with a Sars-Cov2 infection, respectively (HR 3.78, 95% CI 2.1-7.1). For patients undergoing other kind of anticancer treatment, the percentages are 64%, 66% and 27% (HR 2.1, 95% CI 1.4-3.3). Tumor stage at initial presentation, emergency level of primary tumor resection, delays between the first multidisciplinary meeting and the first anticancer treatment did not differ over time. The SARS-Cov2 pandemic has been associated with less newly diagnosed CRC patients and worse 1-year OS rates attributable to the infection itself rather than to its impact on hospital care delivery or tumor stage at initial presentation."

A.; Rosen, Marc A.","The effects are investigated of using absorption chiller, heat pump, and inlet fogging systems for cooling the inlet air of a gas turbine power plant for four cities in Iran representative of different climatic conditions, namely Yazd (hot-arid), Bandar Abbas (hot-humid), Ardabil (cold-humid) and Sari (humid subtropical). Gas turbine functional parameters, quantities of emitted pollutants, prices of generated electricity and capital cost payback periods are determined. The rates of pollutants produced and fuel consumption are considered per unit of electricity generated. The results show that the best cooling system for cities with hot climates is the absorption chiller; it improves gas turbine net power by 18% in Bandar Abbas and 14% in Yazd, the energy efficiency by 5.8% in Bandar Abbas and 5.5% in Yazd, and the exergy efficiency by 2.5% in Bandar Abbas and 1.5% in Yazd. Inlet air cooling reduces NOx pollutant emissions by 60% in Bandar Abbas and 53% in Yazd and reduces electricity generated costs by 6.5% and 6.0% in Bandar Abbas and Yazd respectively. The inlet fogging system performs well only in arid regions. The most appropriate type of cooling system must be selected based on specific objectives (such as increasing power or reducing fuel consumption or reducing pollutants). In cold regions such as Ardabil, where cooling system is used only for a limited period, the heat pump system is suitable because of its low initial investment cost."
1844,A novel hybrid model for forecasting crude oil price based on time series decomposition,"Abdollahi, Hooman","Oil price forecasting has received a prodigious attention by scholars and policymakers due to its significant effect on various economic sectors and markets. Incentivized by this issue, the author proposes a novel hybrid model for crude oil price forecasting whose focus is on improving the accuracy of prediction taking into consideration the characteristics existing in the oil price time series. In so doing, the author constitutes a hybrid model consisting of complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition, support vector machine, particle swarm optimization, and Markov-switching generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity to capture the nonlinearity and volatility of the time series more effectively. Mean absolute error, root mean square error, and mean absolute percentage error tests are used to measure forecasting errors. Results robustness and forecasting quality of the proposed hybrid model compared with counterparts are also investigated by Diebold-Mariano test. Finally, empirical results demonstrate that the proposed hybrid model outperforms other models."

Using data from a national sample of 2,485 U.S. adults aged ≥55, we aimed to describe the magnitude of disruptions to family care arrangements during the initial wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the associations between these disruptions and the mental health outcomes (depression, anxiety, loneliness, and self-rated health) and employment outcomes (job loss or furlough, hours or wages reduced, transition to work-from-home) of family caregivers. We found that COVID-19 disrupted over half of family caregiving arrangements, and that care disruptions were associated with increased depression, anxiety, and loneliness among caregivers, compared with both noncaregivers and caregivers who did not experience disruptions. Family caregivers who experienced pandemic-related employment disruptions were providing more care than caregivers who did not experience disruptions. These findings highlight the impact of the pandemic on an essential and vulnerable health care workforce."

As part of a routine surveillance carried out in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region (IMAR) between 2019 and 2021, 80 of 95 suspected rabies cases in domestic animals (dogs, livestock) and wild carnivores (foxes, badgers, a raccoon dog) were confirmed as rabies virus (RABV) positive. Phylogenetic analysis of RABVs of the 80 cases based on complete N genes showed that 97.5% (78/80) of the virus strains belonged to the Cosmopolitan (steppe-type) clade, with one in each of Arctic-related (AL2) and Asian (SEA1) clades. The data show that infected foxes have become a major transmission source of rabies in China, second only to dogs, and play a pivotal role in animal rabies epizootics in the north and northwest of the country. The recent spread of fox rabies to other animal species presents an increasing threat to public health and emphasizes the importance of animal rabies surveillance."

K.; Sutton, Paul C.; Keesstra, Saskia; Roy, P. S.; Pilla, Francesco; Basu, Bidroha; Wang, Ying; Jha, Shouvik; Paul, Saikat Kumar; Sen, Somnath","Ecosystem Service Valuation (ESV) is a process of evaluating and quantifying the monetary values of ESs and their functions. Using both biophysical and spatially explicit integrated models, biophysical and monetary values of key Ecosystem Services (ESs) were estimated in the Sundarbans Biosphere Region (SBR), India. Quantification was made both in time series (1982-2017) and individual years (1973, 1988, 2003, 2013, 2018, 2025, 2035, 2045) to understand the impact of climate change and land-use dynamics on the long-term ecological status of the region. The monetary and biophysical values of the ESs were then obtained from Net Primary Productivity (NPP) models, Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Trade-offs (InVEST), and Cellular Automata Markov Chain Model (CA-Markov). NPP increased significantly during the first half period (1982-1999), but significantly declined during the second period (2000-2017). The highest estimated ESVs (US$ ha(-1)) was found for habitat service (30780), nutrient cycling (12626), and gas regulation (7224.81), whereas, lower ESVs were approximated for water regulation (347.81), raw material production (777.82) and waste treatment (13.57) services. Among the nine ESs evaluated, climate regulation, gas regulation, and disturbance regulation were the most important regulating services of the SBR. The combined effects of climate change and land-use dynamics on ESs are much stringent in a vulnerable region like the SBR. Most of the regulating services were closely associated with the fluctuation of land use land cover input. Thus, land management policies and land reform strategies that will encourage the conversion of productive land, especially the highly productive mangrove forest, for the development or any other financial benefits, would disturb the ideal human-nature balance of this ecosystem. The outcomes of this study also provide an important reference to the land administrators, researchers, and decision-makers to comprehend the expected socialecological juxtaposition in a protected natural reserve region like the Sundarbans.

1849,The impact of renewable energy on carbon emissions and economic growth in 15 major renewable energy-consuming countries,"Saidi, Kais; Omri, Anis","Closing the gap between carbon emissions and economic development is one of the solutions for reaching the sustainable development goals (SDGs). The role of renewable energy in rebalancing environmental and economic conditions is becoming a significant subject of some debates in the current discussion circles. Hence, the main purpose of this article is to use both growth and environmental functions to demonstrate the effectiveness of renewable energy in promoting economic growth and mitigating carbon emissions in the case of 15 major renewable energy-consuming countries using both fully modified ordinary least square (FMOLS) and vector error correction model (VECM) estimation techniques. The results of the FMOLS method show the efficiency of renewable energy in increasing economic growth and reducing carbon emissions. We also find, from the VECM Granger causality test, that there is (i) a bidirectional causality between economic growth and renewable energy inshort- and long-run for both estimated functions, validating the feedback hypothesis; (ii) no causal relationship between CO2 emissions and renewable energy in the long-run, but a bidirectional causality between the two variables is found in the short-run; (iii) a bidirectional relationship between economic growth and CO2 emissions is found in both short and long-run. Policy and practical implications and future research directions are also discussed."
1850,Spatio-temporal dynamics of ecological security pattern of the Pearl River Delta urban agglomeration based on LUCC simulation,"Li, Zhao-Tian; Li, Miao; Xia, Bei-Cheng","In the past four decades, China has achieved tremendous economic success, but it has also faced serious ecological security (ES) problems. The land use/cover change (LUCC) plays a decisive role in the issue of ES. LUCC and ES evaluation were combined by predicting the change in land use and simulating ES pattern. Taking the Pearl River Delta urban agglomeration (PRD) as the study area, the temporal changes of land use were predicted by the CA-Markov model, and the land use pattern in three different scenarios in 2025 was simulated. Based on the Pressure-State-Response (PSR) model, the ES evaluation of the PRD in 2005, 2010 and 2015 was carried out, and the safety level dropped from 75.39% to 66.67% in this period. Spatial autocorrelation analysis was performed by the GeoDA to reflect the dynamic of ES pattern of the PRD, which suggested that there is greater heterogeneity within the PRD, and the homogenous sub-region continues to increase. Through change the transition probability among different land use types, three scenarios were set: Inertial development, Over expansion, and Ecological protection scenario, which showed that the expansion of construction land (accounting for 18.58%, 20.12% and 17.93% respectively) must occupy agricultural and forest lands and lead to decrease on ES level, the safety level are accounting for 79.07%, 78.30% and 79.95% in the three scenarios respectively. The ES pattern of the PRD was described, the central sub-region of the PRD with high urbanization have relative low ES, and the periphery sub-regions with good ecological order have high ES level, there are more than 63.59% and less than 4.06% of unsafety level of Dongguan and Zhaoqing respectively, which are both the representative city of these two sub-regions. Based on the spatial-temporal dynamic of urban ES, the optimized ES pattern of the PRD was proposed, three eco-functional zones were determined: ecological conservation zone, living environment guarantee zone and ecological restoration zone. The eco-functional zones have defined the leading ecological functions of each sub-region and could gradually improve the integrity and connectivity of the entire ecosystem of the PRD, which provides valuable knowledge for understanding and planning regional city management."
1851,The waste treatment and recycling efficiency of industrial waste processing based on two-stage data envelopment analysis with undesirable inputs,"Li, Dan; Wang, Mei-Qiang; Lee, Chieh","Achieving a resource-conserving and environment friendly supply chain while pursuing economic development has always been the goal of countries across the world. As an emerging industrial nation, China is battling serious environmental problems. While there have been efforts to address waste processing, researchers are now interested in gauging the efficiency of waste treatment policies. We built a two-stage data envelopment analysis model with undesirable input to assess the efficiency of recycle treating and industrial waste reuse, including wastewater, waste gas and solid wastes in China. Our model is based on a circular economy structure that proposed by Environmental Protection Institute of China. The proposed method can serve as evaluation tool for the government policy in China as well as other emerging economy. We collected the data during the critical environmental policy enforcement period: the 11th five-year plan (from 2006 to 2010). We also analyze the waste treatment efficacy for the solid waste in the 11th and 12th five-year plan period (from 2011 to 2015). In contrast to earlier studies that have mainly focused on pollution disposal efficiency, this work takes both pollution and resource attributes of waste into consideration. The results revealed that integrated efficiency of industrial waste processing system was stable over five years. It also showed that efficiency at the pollution disposal stage was higher than that at the resources reuse stage, and contributed more to overall efficiency. We also find that the efficiency of the pollution and disposal of the solid waste improved during the 11th and 12th five-year plan. Further, the study reveal that the pollution disposal stage shows a similar trend as the integrated system, while the resources reuse stage does not. Finally, it also displays that there are three efficient development modes, namely, balanced, ecosystem, and coordinate development modes. In discussion, we provide benchmarks from developed countries for different development mode.

1852,Dimensional characteristics of the major types of amphibole mineral particles and the implications for carcinogenic risk assessment,"Andrey A Korchevskiy,Ann G Wylie,Andrey A Korchevskiy,Ann G Wylie","Context: Though some significant advances have been made in recent decades to evaluate the importance of size and morphology (habit) of elongate mineral particles (EMPs), further research is needed to better understand the role of each dimensional metric in determining the levels of cancer potency.Objective: To determine dimensional parameters most relevant for predicting cancer potency of durable elongate particles, specifically amphibole and durable silicate minerals generally.Methods: A database on dimensional and other relevant characteristics of elongate amphibole mineral particles was created, containing particle-by-particle information for 128 099 particles. Integral statistical characteristics on dimensionality of various amphibole types and morphological habits of EMPs were calculated, compared, and correlated with published mesothelioma and lung cancer potency factors.Results: The highest absolute Pearson correlation (r = 0.97, r2 = 0.94, p < 0.05) was achieved between mesothelioma potency (RM) and specific surface area. The highest correlation with adjusted lung cancer potency was found with particle aspect ratio (AR) (r = 0.80, r2 = 0.64, p < 0.05). Cluster analysis demonstrates that fractions of thin fibers (width less than 0.15 and 0.25 µm) also closely relate both to lung cancer and RM. Asbestiform and non-asbestiform populations of amphiboles significantly differ by dimensionality and carcinogenic potency.Conclusions: Dimensional parameters and morphological habits of EMPs are the main drivers for the observable difference in cancer potency among amphibole populations."

Anseriformes water birds are an important reservoir of IAVs. In this study, we identified and characterized IAV subtypes H11N6 (n = 5), H11N7 (n = 3), and H11N9 (n = 3) isolated during the influenza surveillance program in free-grazing ducks from 2012 to 2015 in Thailand. Eleven IAV-H11 viruses were characterized by either whole genome sequencing (n = 5) or HA and NA gene sequencing (n = 6) for phylogenetic and amino acid analyses. Phylogenetic analysis showed that Thai IAV-H11 were grouped into Avian Eurasian lineage. Amino acid analysis showed that all Thai IAV-H11 viruses have low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) characteristics and sensitive to Oseltamivir and Amantadine. Novel reassortant viruses (IAV-H11N7 and IAV-H11N9) have been observed. The reassortant viruses contained NP, M, and NS gene segments which originate from intercontinental sources which never been reported in Thai IAVs. In summary, this study demonstrated high genetic diversity of IAV-H11 circulating in free-grazing ducks. Free-grazing ducks infected with IAVs generated novel reassortant IAV-H11. Thus, surveillance of IAVs in free-grazing ducks should be routinely conducted to monitor novel reassortant viruses and subsequently potential virulence viruses."
1854,Techno-economic evaluation of indirect carbonation for CO2 emissions capture in cement industry: A system dynamics approach,"Proano, Laura; Sarmiento, Alfonso T.; Figueredo, Manuel; Cobo, Martha","CO2 emissions in the cement industry account for about 8% of the total CO2 emissions worldwide. They mainly originate from limestone calcination and fossil fuel combustion in clinker production. To avoid the 2 degrees C increase in global temperature compared with the pre-industrial global temperature, which was proposed in the COP21 agreement in 2015, the cement industry should reduce CO2 emissions by 24%. Thus, this study evaluates an indirect carbonation CO2 capture and utilization technology for CO2 emissions abatement in the clinker production. The indirect carbonation process was assessed using different hydroxides (Na, Ba, and Ca) as absorbent precursors. Technical evaluation shows that the carbonation process using Na and Ba hydroxides was feasible between 50 and 70 degrees C, with CO2 capture efficiencies of 98% and 65%, respectively. On the contrary, the Ca-based process only obtained an efficiency of 0.5% due to the low solubility of Ca(OH)(2) in water, resulting in technical impracticality. The estimated costs of CO2 capture for Na and Ba processes were assessed at 65 and 140 USD/t CO2, respectively. Moreover, the economic impact of implementing the CO2 capture carbonation technology in a cement plant and the effect of market and governmental conditions on the overall cement plant cashflow were analyzed by integrating technical results and economic evaluation in a system dynamics model. This model was developed to appraise the overall economic impact of CO2 capture on a referential cement plant profits under different market scenarios and a CO2 tax economic policy. System dynamics results showed that market factors, such as the carbonate demand, limit the CO2 capture potential of the indirect carbonation technology. Moreover, it was noticed that the implementation of the NaOH and Ba(OH)(2) carbonation technologies reduces cement plant profits by 55% and 5%, respectively, when CO2 emissions were reduced by 65% in both scenarios. Furthermore, the application of a CO2 tax between 20 and 80 USD/t CO2 emitted will encourage the implementation of CO2 capture technologies, with the aim to reduce its emissions by 24% via cement plants.

The study examined the relationship between the users' characteristics and their knowledge on soil-plant relationship. Online survey was designed and distributed to gather the data. The number of response was received from 383 respondents where 375 participants provided completed information and the remaining eight responses were eliminated due to quality standards. The results show most of the participants (68.8%) are moderately depend on social media to acquire knowledge on soil-plant relationship and indicated ""Twitter"" as the highly utilized platform followed by the ""Youtube"". Meanwhile, 48.8% of the participants indicated that social media have a high impact on their knowledge-based information on soil-plant relationship and agricultural contents. Inferential analysis shows there was a significant positive relationship (p < 0.01) between independent variables; Twitter, Youtube, Instagram, and Snapchat and the degree of trust on these platforms, and the level's knowledge on soil-plant relationship (dependent variable). Only 13% of the variance accounted for the impact of social media on participants' agricultural knowledge-base can be predicted from the combination of participants' reliance on a set of social media platforms (Twitter, Instagram, Youtube, and Snapchat). The study revealed the trust and confidence of the users using social media on agricultural information/soil plant relationship had a medium effect in social and educational research."
1856,Empirical generalizations in eco-innovation: A meta-analytic approach,"Bitencourt, Claudia Cristina; Santini, Fernando de Oliveira; Zanandrea, Gabriela; Froehlich, Cristiane; Ladeira, Wagner Junior","Although discussions on eco-innovation are ongoing and the concept is evolving, its central idea is highly stimulating. Thus, a great number of studies has been conducted in recent years around the world based on different perspectives, contexts and outcomes. Therefore, the identification and analysis of factors related to eco-innovation are essential if knowledge in this field is to be improved and consolidated. This research aimed to advance our understanding of the different dimensions of eco-innovation through a meta-analytical review of its antecedents or drivers, consequents and moderators. Thus, a total of 71 studies was analysed, generating 818 effect sizes and 220,582 cumulative samples. The main findings revealed that barriers, company capabilities, environmental regulation, market turbulence, information sources, R&D and company size were significant antecedents to eco-innovation. It was also noted that a significance relationship exists between eco-innovation and firm performance. Regarding the moderating effect, it was observed that culture, the economic situation of the country and context influence the relationship between eco-innovation and performance. The results revealed that countries with a lower HDI presented stronger effects between eco-innovation and firm performance than countries with a higher HDI. These findings were interesting because they could demonstrate that eco-innovation tends to promote more competitive advantage in countries with environmental problems and consequently a lower HDI.

1857,Developing novel 5th generation district energy networks,"Revesz, Akos; Jones, Phil; Dunham, Chris; Davies, Gareth; Marques, Catarina; Matabuena, Rodrigo; Scott, Jim; Maidment, Graeme","Integrated smartly controlled energy networks have the potential to deliver significant reductions in carbon emissions, improve air quality and reduce energy costs for end-users across the world. This paper introduces a novel methodology for the development of integrated thermal, power and mobility 5th generation (5G) smart energy networks. The proposed 5G concept builds on state of the art by connecting flexible electricity demands such as heat pumps, and electric vehicles to intermittent, renewable and secondary energy sources and storage using artificial intelligence to facilitate optimal control and to maximise revenue and carbon savings. The proposed innovative method is being applied in central London through the development of two independent 5G smart energy schemes. The proposed schemes will incorporate a range of different renewables and secondary energy sources, for example, waste heat from local data centres and the London Underground that will supply a large proportion of the energy demand of the overall district network capacity. Both networks will operate at close to ambient temperature, approximately 15-25 degrees C as a so-called 'ambient loop' system, with individual heat pumps for each end-user or building connected to the network. The system also integrates thermal and electrical storage to create additional flexibility for the network and smart control for demand-side management. A smart management system flexibly controls individual assets such as heat pumps and electric vehicles in response to price signals reflecting the intermittency of renewable energy sources on the electricity grid. The ambient district thermal loop will distribute low carbon energy to a range of end users. Results presented in this paper provide an understanding of capital costs associated with integrated smart energy systems and the relative performance of individual technologies in a complex system using a techno-economic modelling approach. Overall, this paper demonstrates that the implementation of the 5G concept results in lower energy costs to consumers while at the same time transforming a large existing urban area to a near zero-carbon energy system in terms of heating, cooling, electricity and transport.

1858,Financial Development and Foreign Direct Investment-The Moderating Role of Quality Institutions,"Islam, Mollah Aminul; Khan, Muhammad Asif; Popp, Jozsef; Sroka, Wlodzimierz; Olah, Judit","Considering the importance of foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows for the sustainable economic advancement of a host country, this paper investigates the financial development and FDI nexus, using institutional quality as a moderator. The sample consists of 79 Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) partner countries, as these countries are entering a new age of integration, foreign trade, and mutual development. The empirical findings of conventional and robust estimators show that the financial development of BRI host countries significantly attracts FDI, while the institutional quality plays a significant moderating role in this relation. The in-depth analysis offers the insight that financial markets are less attractive to FDI relative to financial institutions. Thus, policymakers are advised to uphold sound financial institutions to make the country more attractive to overseas investors, while concentration on financial markets may multiply the benefits of FDI. The results are robust to alternative proxies of the key variables and alternative methodologies."

The closed-loop network control system (NCS) is constructed by modeling random and bounded network-induced time delays existing in forward and feedback channels as a discrete-time Markov chain. Incremental time delay information is introduced in Lyapunov functional analysis to satisfy the high-precision movement of master and secondary motors and improve the system control performance. The time delay compensation method is proposed to compensate for the damage to the networked control system caused by random delay. With Lyapunov stability theory and LMI are applied, stability and stabilization conditions with less computational complexity and low conservatism are obtained based on incremental time delay information insertion. Finally, the numerical simulation and the experimental platform of the motor control system are built. Simulation and experiment results demonstrate that the networked control strategy can compensate the negative impact of delay on the tracking performance of LSRMs based motion control system."
1860,Risk assessment for oil leakage under the common threat of multiple natural hazards,"Qin, Guojin; Zhang, Peng; Hou, Xiangqin; Wu, Sen; Wang, Yihuan","Petroleum industry can create enormous wealth and employment opportunities, which is one of the pillars of the national economy. The transportation conditions of petroleum products are complex and changeable. The natural disaster-induced dangerous chemical leakage may damage the ecological environment, which leads to substantial economic losses. It significantly undermines the sustainable development agenda. Therefore, assessing the possibility of leakage and the potential environmental damages becomes a primary task to decision-makers to formulate maintenance plans. This paper evaluated the risk of an oil pipeline leakage under the regional geological disasters. Specifically, risk assessment indicators system was established considering the common threat of multiple natural hazards in the region. The sensitivities of the influence factors were determined using the combined GIS and the contribution rate model. The fuzzy analysis approach was used to process the expert's judgment to obtain a real-time disaster hazard. Meanwhile, in terms of the analysis of pipeline failure causes, the assessment system of disaster resistance ability was developed to determine the possibility of leakage. The leakage-induced environmental losses were quantified by monetary quantification. Finally, the level of environmental risk was determined using a 5 x 5 probability-currency matrix. Case results show that the risk level is medium, thereby appropriate maintenance measures need to be taken to reduce the risk. Overall, this study provides necessary help to prevent the leakage of petroleum products in transportation. Also, the environmental risk presented in the form of currency can promote non-environmental professional risk decision-makers better understand the degree of risk."

Any disturbance in these developmental events, their progenitor tissues, or signaling pathways can result in craniofacial deformities such as orofacial clefts, which are among the most common birth defects in humans. In the present study, we show that Rdh10 loss of function leads to a substantial reduction in retinoic acid (RA) signaling in the developing frontonasal process during early embryogenesis, which results in a variety of craniofacial anomalies, including midfacial cleft and ectopic chondrogenic nodules. Elevated apoptosis and perturbed cell proliferation in postmigratory cranial neural crest cells and a substantial reduction in Alx1 and Alx3 transcription in the developing frontonasal process were associated with midfacial cleft in Rdh10-deficient mice. More important, expanded Shh signaling in the ventral forebrain, as well as partial abrogation of midfacial defects in Rdh10 mutants via inhibition of Hh signaling, indicates that misregulation of Shh signaling underlies the pathogenesis of reduced RA signaling-associated midfacial defects. Taken together, these data illustrate the precise spatiotemporal function of Rdh10 and RA signaling during early embryogenesis and their importance in orchestrating molecular and cellular events essential for normal midfacial development."

Finding the most suitable path for technological progress and structural change to promote economic growth is the key to adopting Industry 4.0 technologies and successfully transforming to a CE, and thus, key to China achieving sustainable development quickly. This study identifies the joint effects of energy- and environment-biased technological progress and multi-dimensional industrial structural change on economic growth, and empirically verifies the specific effects within China. Our results are as follows. First, pollution abatement technological progress, backstop technological progress and autogenous structural ecologicalization are the main drivers of sustainable economic growth. Second, innovation policies have a positive impact on national economic growth by promoting pollution abatement technological progress. Finally, in sub-regions' regression, backstop and environment technology, and structural ecologicalization promote eastern China's economy, while policies drive environment technological progress and structural ecologicalization to stimulate economic growth in central and western China. Our results imply that policymakers should take into consideration the readiness levels of each region regarding the adoption of Industry 4.0 and circular economy, and that the government should consider and ensure the participation of all stakeholders, including firms.

1863,A Comprehensive Review on the Electrochemical Sensing of Flavonoids,"Sariga,Ashlay George,Rijo Rajeev,Ditto Abraham Thadathil,Anitha Varghese,Sariga,Ashlay George,Rijo Rajeev,Ditto Abraham Thadathil,Anitha Varghese","Flavonoids are bioactive polyphenolic compounds, widespread in the plant kingdom. Flavonoids possess broad-spectrum pharmacological effects due to their antioxidant, anti-tumor, anti-neoplastic, anti-mutagenic, anti-microbial, anti-inflammatory, anti-allergic, immunomodulatory, and vasodilatory properties. Care must be taken, since excessive consumption of flavonoids may have adverse effects. Therefore, proper identification, quantification and quality evaluations of flavonoids in edible samples are necessary. Electroanalytical approaches have gained much interest for the analysis of redox behavior and quantification of different flavonoids. Compared to various conventional methods, electrochemical techniques for the analysis of flavonoids offer advantages of high sensitivity, selectivity, low cost, simplicity, biocompatibility, easy on-site evaluation, high accuracy, reproducibility, wide linearity of detection, and low detection limits. This review article focuses on the developments in electrochemical sensing of different flavonoids with emphasis on electrode modification strategies to boost the electrocatalytic activity and analytical efficiency."

It is unknown how land management interventions in dry climate conditions can benefit water yield in the context of climate and land use change interactions. In this study, we assessed the effects of both land use and predicted climate change on the Mordagh Chay basin water yield using the Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Tradeoffs model. First, we modeled the current water yield, followed by developing six combined climate-land use scenarios until 2030 based on the CCSM4 climate model for the RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios. We used three future land use scenarios simulated by the Dyna-CLUE model. The trend scenario of land use change, which does not include any improvements in irrigation efficiency, significantly affected basin water yield under both climate scenarios. Water yield decreases by 19.8% and 31.8% for the RCP4.5 and RCP8.5, respectively. Under all land use scenarios that included improvements in irrigation efficiency, the water yield responded positively. For the RCP4.5 scenario, the water yield was projected to increase between 16.6% and 18% depending on the land use scenario. The increase in water yield under the RCP8.5 climate scenario was much lower than for the RCP4.5 scenario (about one-third). Overall, the results showed that by adopting appropriate irrigation efficiency, it is possible to achieve a better balance between environmental needs and regional economic and agricultural development. The results provide insight into possible sustainable development options and also provide guidance for managing the other Urmia Lake sub-basins, whereas the approach of integrated assessment of climate, land use change, and land management options is also applicable in other conditions to help inform sustainable management."

The suitability of the site for PV plant development is initially examined with site assessment criteria. PVsyst software is then used to model, simulate and estimate the performance of three PV technology plants. Economic analysis is conducted on the three PV systems with RETScreen software. NASA SSE solar irradiation data set from NASA website were used for the assessments. Site assessments results showed that mono-crystalline silicon, poly-crystalline silicon, and thin film (CdTe) systems would occupy 9%, 10%, and 13% respectively of the 2000 acres acquired for the campus. The performance analysis showed that monocrystalline silicon, poly-crystalline silicon and thin film (CdTe) systems would export 67315 MW h, 67506 MW h, and 68991 MW h respectively to the grid annually while meeting more than 48% of campus electricity needs. The costs of the energy produced by the systems are 12.4 cents/kWh, 12.3 cents/kWh and 10.9 cents/kWh for mono-crystalline, polycrystalline and thin film systems respectively. The determined costs of energy for the systems are lower than the set feed-in tariff of 14 cents/kWh. NPV was positive for all the systems while; benefits to cost ratios were greater than 1.0 with reasonable payback periods of 7.2 years for crystalline silicon technology systems and 6.4 for thin film technology system.

Herein, the authors successfully synthesize PtFe nanofoams with face center cubic (fcc) phase, with simple cubic crystalline (scc) phase and with the mixture phases of fcc and scc phases (PtFe-mix) by hydrogen-assisted calcination for the first time. By benchmarking the HER activity, PtFe-mix exhibits excellent activity in 1.0 m KOH, requiring an overpotential of 28 mV to achieve 10 mA cm-2 , which is better than the commercial Pt/C (34 mV). PtFe-mix also possesses remarkable stability up to 24 h. Density functional theory calculations further verify that PtFe-mix shows a more suitable d-band center and lower energy barrier for the initial water dissociation, facilitating the HER process. This work provides a meaningful strategy to design PtFe-based catalysts with efficient activity for hydrogen evolution."

Experimental studies indicate that some of these relationships persist even when the physical environment is held constant. Here, we draw on datasets from one such study-experimental manipulation of dominance rank in captive female rhesus macaques-to investigate how social status shapes the lived experience of these animals to alter gene regulation, glucocorticoid physiology and mitochondrial DNA phenotypes. We focus specifically on dominance rank-associated dimensions of the social environment, including both competitive and affiliative interactions. Our results show that simple summaries of rank-associated behavioural interactions are often better predictors of molecular and physiological outcomes than dominance rank itself. However, while measures of immune function are best explained by agonism rates, glucocorticoid-related phenotypes tend to be more closely linked to affiliative behaviour. We conclude that dominance rank serves as a useful summary for investigating social environmental effects on downstream outcomes. Nevertheless, the behavioural interactions that define an individual's daily experiences reveal the proximate drivers of social status-related differences and are especially relevant for understanding why individuals who share the same social status sometimes appear physiologically distinct. This article is part of the theme issue 'The centennial of the pecking order: current state and future prospects for the study of dominance hierarchies'."

Many different etiologies have been associated with aortic pseudoaneurysms including; atherosclerosis, infections, connective tissue disorders, and traumatic causes. In addition, aortic pseudoaneurysms have been reported following thoracic surgeries, including aortic valve replacements, aortic dissection repair, and coronary artery bypass grafting. Aspergillus is amongst the infectious etiologies of pseudoaneurysms. Aspergillus species is a ubiquitous mold (fungus) that is mostly harmless but may result in serious illnesses in immunocompromised hosts with hematologic neoplasms, neutropenia, or immunodeficiency syndromes.

1870,The role of institutional quality in FDI inflows and carbon emission reduction: evidence from the global developing and belt road initiative countries,"Hayat Khan,Liu Weili,Itbar Khan,Hayat Khan,Liu Weili,Itbar Khan","Achieving economic growth is the primary concern mostly of every country to enhance living standard; however, an increase in economic activities may have environmental consequences. Foreign direct investment is also considered a driver of economic growth while it affects the quality of environment. The role of institutions can be useful to enhance foreign direct investment (FDI) inflow which can in turn increase economic growth and safeguard environmental quality. Based on the ongoing debate, this study attempts whether the quality of institutions plays any role in FDI inflow and in enhancement of environmental quality. For this purpose, this study examines the role of institutional quality in FDI inflows and carbon emission reduction in the global panel, 107 world developing, and 39 Belt and Road Initiative countries for the period of 2002-2019. By using both static and dynamic panel models, the results indicate that governance indicators are important for FDI inflows, but this impact varies in different panels. Overall, institutional quality has a significant and positive impact on foreign direct investment inflow, while energy use reduces it in all panels. Economic growth positively associated with carbon emission, while the square of GDP evidences the environmental Kuznets curve. FDI and trade increase global and developing countries' emissions, while reducing emission in Belt and Road countries. Institutional quality along individual indicators, political stability, rule of law, and regulatory quality are found to be poor governance indicators in all panels, while voice and accountability and control of corruption are weak indicators in Belt and Road countries; however, the interaction term proves that the quality of institutions is regulated by financial development and FDI in carbon emission reduction in all panels. This study has considerable policy significance for countries to carry out strong policy reforms to increase green FDI and improve environmental quality."
1871,Heavy metal pollution risk assessments and their transportation in sediment and overlay water for the typical Chinese reservoirs,"Deng, Meihua; Yang, Xiaoe; Dai, Xi; Zhang, Qi; Malik, Arunima; Sadeghpour, Amir","To assess the metals (Cr, Mn, Cu, Zn, Cd, Hg and Pb) pollution risks and their transportation in sediment and overlay water from the typical reservoirs in the rapidly developing economic region of southeastern China, this study integrated an intact sediment core incubation and the sediment metals vertical distribution analysis in a drinking water reservoir (Drinking-Y) and an irrigation water reservoir (Irrigation-T). The results revealed that both studied reservoirs were severely polluted by heavy metals. Irrigation-T was at a considerable risk compared to Drinking-Y (a moderate or slightly considerable risk) reflecting higher concentration of metals in Irrigation-T versus Drinking-Y. Concentrations of Hg and Cd in the overlying water exceeded the World Health Organization (WHO) standard, contributing approximately 90% of the total potential ecological risk index (RI) for both metals in the sediment. Most of the metals continue to increase inputs into the reservoirs and metals can settle from water to sediment in 10-15 days by static incubation. The main anthropogenic pollution sources originated from fuel combinations and industry mills (6.4%) and agricultural activities (38%) for Drinking-Y and fuel combinations and industry mills (4.9%), agricultural activities (32.9%) and mines and quarries (62.1%) for Irrigation-T. To reduce the human health risks, therefore, the freshwater should be stored 10-15 days prior to drinking or irrigation. Our data indicated that all the current pollution sources require more attention for further reducing the human health risks."
1872,Depression in the house: The effects of household air pollution from solid fuel use among the middle-aged and older population in China,"Liu, Yan; Chen, Xi; Yan, Zhijun","Background: Although the adverse health effects of ambient air pollution are well documented, evidence on the depression effects of household air pollution (HAP) are scarce. Objectives: We investigated the effects of HAP exposure from the use of solid fuel on depression using a nationally representative dataset of middle-aged and older population in China. Methods: By employing the propensity score matching method, we first matched the type of household fuel based on background information, including demographic characteristics, lifestyles, health status, and household economic levels. Based on the matched data, we conducted OLS and logistic regressions with cluster standard error at community level to examine the effects of household solid fuel use on depression and adjusted for potential confounders. Heterogeneous effects for vulnerable population were also considered. Results: We found a significantly higher Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) score and depression risk among current household solid fuel users. After matching and adjusting for potential confounders, current solid fuel users had a higher CES-D score of 0.59 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.31, 0.89) than clean fuel users. The OR of depression risk were 1.26 (95% CI: 1.14, 1.41). Solid fuel users had the highest CES-D scores (beta = 0.99, 95% CI: 0.62, 1.36) and depression risk (OR = 1.49, 95% CI: 1.30, 1.73) for over five years. These associations were generally higher in females, participants aged 65 years and older, with a BMI >= 25, with low education, with low household economic levels, and those suffer from chronic diseases, including diabetes, chronic lung diseases, and cardiovascular diseases. Conclusions: Exposure to HAP from solid fuel combustion was linked with strong depression outcomes. Findings suggested a need to strengthen public health efforts, such as controlling the social, health, and economic costs of depression by taking the physical environment, including HAP exposure, into account.

1873,Effects of PM2.5 on health and economic loss: Evidence from Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region of China,"Wang, Jianzhou; Zhang, Lifang; Niu, Xinsong; Liu, Zhenkun","Rapid industrialization and urbanization have triggered severe PM(2.5 )pollution and induced serious health hazards and economic losses in densely populated regions. A substantial number of health-related economic loss assessment methods, which quantify economic losses caused by diverse health endpoints, have been applied. However, traditional models neglect pollutant distribution and optimization of distribution parameters, which may lead to poor estimation accuracy. In this study, a health-related economic loss evaluation system is proposed, which deals with PM2.5 distribution, optimization of distribution parameters, and evaluation of health-related economic losses. This assessment system efficiently simulated the characteristic of PM2.5 concentrations in three cities of the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region and addressed economic losses estimation problems. The results indicate that the system not only provides a novel perspective on health-related economic loss assessment, but also assists policymakers in its practical application.

1874,S100B in cardiac surgery brain monitoring: friend or foe?,"Giuseppe Lapergola,Alessandro Graziosi,Ebe D'Adamo,Patrizia Brindisino,Mariangela Ferrari,Anna Romanelli,Mariachiara Strozzi,Roberta Libener,Danilo A W Gavilanes,Antonio Maconi,Angela Satriano,Alessandro Varrica,Diego Gazzolo,Giuseppe Lapergola,Alessandro Graziosi,Ebe D'Adamo,Patrizia Brindisino,Mariangela Ferrari,Anna Romanelli,Mariachiara Strozzi,Roberta Libener,Danilo A W Gavilanes,Antonio Maconi,Angela Satriano,Alessandro Varrica,Diego Gazzolo","Recent advances in perioperative management of adult and pediatric patients requiring open heart surgery (OHS) and cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) for cardiac and/or congenital heart diseases repair allowed a significant reduction in the mortality rate. Conversely morbidity rate pattern has a flat trend. Perioperative period is crucial since OHS and CPB are widely accepted as a deliberate hypoxic-ischemic reperfusion damage representing the cost to pay at a time when standard of care monitoring procedures can be silent or unavailable. In this respect, the measurement of neuro-biomarkers (NB), able to detect at early stage perioperative brain damage could be especially useful. In the last decade, among a series of NB, S100B protein has been investigated. After the first promising results, supporting the usefulness of the protein as predictor of short/long term adverse neurological outcome, the protein has been progressively abandoned due to a series of limitations. In the present review we offer an up-dated overview of the main S100B pros and cons in the peri-operative monitoring of adult and pediatric patients."
1875,Mission-oriented innovation systems,"Hekkert, Marko P.; Janssen, Matthijs J.; Wesseling, Joeri H.; Negro, Simona O.","Rather than merely supporting R&D and strengthening innovation systems, the focus of innovation policy is currently shifting towards addressing societal challenges by transforming socio-economic systems. A particular trend within the emerging era of transformative innovation policy is the pursuit of challenge-based innovation missions, such as achieving a 50 % circular economy by 2030. By formulating clear and ambitious societal goals, policy makers are aiming to steer the directionality and adoption of innovation. In the absence of suitable frameworks to understand and enhance the impact of missions, we introduce the notion of Mission-oriented Innovation Systems (MIS). MIS consists of networks of agents and sets of institutions that contribute to the development and diffusion of innovative solutions with the aim to define, pursue and complete a societal mission. We provide several promising research avenues, including how MIS come into existence, how they are governed and how the interactions taking place in a MIS may influence directionality and technological variety."
1876,Are Trade Liberalization policies aligned with Renewable Energy Transition in low and middle income countries? An Instrumental Variable approach,"Murshed, Muntasir","This paper attempts to empirically analyze the compatibility of national trade liberalization policies with regards to promoting widespread use of renewable energy resources across 71 low, lower-middle and upper-middle income countries from South Asia, East Asia, Pacific, Central Asia, Latin America, Caribbean islands and Sub-Saharan Africa. Annual time series data from 2000 to 2017 is employed to perform panel data cointegration and regression analyses. The results from the cointegration analyses show long-run associations between trade liberalization policies and the renewable energy consumption indicators. The Instrumental Variable Two-Stage Least Squares panel data estimator is employed to control for the endogeneity in the dataset. The overall results broadly point towards the effectiveness of greater trade openness in facilitating renewable energy transition only in the low-income economies while prolonging the transition periods in the lower and upper-middle income countries. The marginal impact of a rise in the trade openness index is estimated to enhance the renewable energy share in total energy consumption within low-income countries by 0.24% as opposed to lowering this share by 0.19% within lower-middle income economies. However, trade liberalization is found to attribute to greater efficiency of renewable energy use across all the three income groups. Thus, these findings have critically important policy implications for the respective governments. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."
1877,Built environment design - social sustainability relation in urban renewal,"Yildiz, Serkan; Kivrak, Serkan; Gultekin, Arzuhan Burcu; Arslan, Gokhan","Urban renewal practices could improve urban social sustainability with well-designed and well-constructed built environments. This study shows the development of a model, which explains the relation between built environment design and social sustainability in urban renewal. To do so, firstly, a comprehensive literature review was conducted, after which a pilot study was administered. This led to the identification of 32 built environment design elements. Their contributions to social sustainability were evaluated utilizing a survey among 323 people who previously worked in urban renewal projects. The design elements were grouped by exploratory factor analysis under five factors, and these factors were named as, accessibility and quality of social life, conservation of resources, quality of the built environment, protection of disadvantaged groups, and commercial and economic opportunities. Then, the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) was carried out with 60 academics and practitioners to identify the weights of the factors. Accessibility and quality of social life factor reached the highest weight with 33 %, while the other four factors shared close weights. The model obtained as a result of this study will increase the awareness of urban renewal stakeholders about social sustainability, by demonstrating clearly which design elements should be considered to improve the social sustainability of urban renewal projects."
1878,The use of analgesics and associated factors among nursing home residents,"Mohammad Rababa,Audai A Hayajneh,Sami Al-Rawashdeh,Nahedh Alawneh,Mohammad Rababa,Audai A Hayajneh,Sami Al-Rawashdeh,Nahedh Alawneh","Aim: This study examined the use of analgesics and associated factors among nursing home residents (NHRs). Materials & methods: A descriptive correlational design and a convenience sample of 209 NHRs receiving analgesics was used in this study. Results: Higher use of analgesics was noted among NHRs without cognitive impairment (p < 0.001), those with higher anticholinergic burden scores (p = 0.002) and those with a higher average number of oral pills taken daily (p = 0.045). Conclusion: These findings contribute to a better understanding of the prevalence and associated factors of analgesic use, which will inform the development and application of evidence-based pain practice and guidelines in nursing homes in Jordan and beyond."
1879,An essential review of Singapore's response to out-of-hospital cardiac arrests: improvements over a ten-year period,"Alexander E White,Andrew Fw Ho,Nur Shahidah,Nurul Asyikin,Le Xuan Liew,Pin Pin Pek,Jade Ph Kua,Michael Yc Chia,Yih Yng Ng,Shalini Arulanandam,Sieu-Hon Benjamin Leong,Marcus Eh Ong,Alexander E White,Andrew Fw Ho,Nur Shahidah,Nurul Asyikin,Le Xuan Liew,Pin Pin Pek,Jade Ph Kua,Michael Yc Chia,Yih Yng Ng,Shalini Arulanandam,Sieu-Hon Benjamin Leong,Marcus Eh Ong","Care for patients who experience out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) has rapidly evolved in the past decade. Increased sophistication of care in the community, emergency medical services (EMS) and hospital setting is associated with improved patient-centred outcomes. Notably, Utstein survival doubled from 11.6% to 23.1% between 2011 and 2016. These achievements involved collaboration between policymakers, clinicians and researchers, and were made possible by a strategic interplay of policy, research and implementation. We review the development and current state of OHCA in Singapore using primary population-based data from the Pan-Asian Resuscitation Outcomes Study and an unstructured search of research databases. We discuss the roles of important milestones in policy, community, dispatch, EMS and hospital interventions. Finally, we relate these interventions to relevant processes and outcomes, such as the relationship between the strategic implementation of bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation and placement of automated external defibrillator with return of spontaneous circulation, survival to discharge and survival with favourable neurological outcomes."
1880,High carriage of plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance (PMQR) genes by cefotaxime-resistant Escherichia coli recovered from surface-leaking sanitary sewers,"Abimbola Olumide Adekanmbi,Olabisi Comfort Akinlabi,Adedolapo Victoria Olaposi,Abimbola Olumide Adekanmbi,Olabisi Comfort Akinlabi,Adedolapo Victoria Olaposi","There is a rapid rise in the incidence of quinolone resistant bacteria in Nigeria. Most studies in Nigeria have focused on isolates from the clinical settings, with few focusing on isolates of environmental origin. This study aimed to investigate the antibiogram and carriage of plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance (PMQR) genes by quinolone-resistant isolates obtained from a pool of cefotaxime-resistant Escherichia coli (E. coli) recovered from sewage leaking out of some surface-leaking sanitary sewers in a University community in Nigeria. Isolation of E. coli from the sewage samples was done on CHROMagar E. coli, after enrichment of the samples was done in Brain Heart Infusion broth amended with 6 µg/mL of cefotaxime. Identification of presumptive E. coli was done using molecular methods (detection of uidA gene), while susceptibility to antibiotics was carried out using the disc diffusion method. Detection of PMQR genes (qnrA, qnrB, qnrS, aac(6')-lb-cr, qepA and oqxAB) was carried out using primer-specific PCR. A total of 32 non-repetitive cefotaxime-resistant E. coli were obtained from the sewage, with 21 being quinolone-resistant. The quinolone-resistant isolates showed varying level of resistance to the tested antibiotics, with imipenem being the only exception with 0% resistance. The PMQR genes: aac(6')-lb-cr, qnrA, qnrB, qnrS and qepA and oqxAB were detected in 90.5%, 61.9%, 47.6%, 38.1%, 4.8% and 0% respectively of the isolates. The findings of this study showed a high level of resistance to antibiotics and carriage of PMQR genes by quinolone-resistant E. coli obtained from the leaking sanitary sewers, suggesting a potential environmental and public health concern."
1881,Regional renewable energy development in China: A multidimensional assessment,"Wang, Ying; Zhang, Dayong; Ji, Qiang; Shi, Xunpeng","Renewable energy (RE) is strategically important to achieve sustainability. Its development in China, however, is clearly imbalanced across regions. The uneven distribution of natural resources, financial resources and other factors across this country has brought serious challenges to the policymakers. It is thus important to give a comprehensive evaluation of China's regional RE development. To do so, this paper introduces a multidimensional approach and establishes a quantitative evaluation framework. Based on the existing literature, five dimensions of factors have been chosen for the framwork: economic foundation, institutions, technological development potential, energy security and environmental protection, and current status of the RE sector. A dynamic principal component analysis technique is applied to data from 29 provinces between 2008 and 2014. The results demonstrate large variations in RE development across provinces in China. More economically developed regions, such as Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangdong, have maintained a higher ranking and have clear advantages in almost all dimensions. Policy implications and recommendations for more balanced development across China are drawn from the empirical results. This approach can also be extended to investigate similar issues in other countries."
1882,Clinical value of routine [18F]2-fluoro-2-deoxy-d-glucose positron emission tomography scans as a decision tool for early immunotherapy discontinuation in advanced melanoma,"Eva Ellebaek,Aimilia Schina,Rikke Andersen,Helle Westergren Hendel,Inge Marie Svane,Marco Donia,Eva Ellebaek,Aimilia Schina,Rikke Andersen,Helle Westergren Hendel,Inge Marie Svane,Marco Donia","Routine [18F]2-fluoro-2-deoxy-d-glucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) may help predict clinical outcomes after response to immunotherapy. With a European Medicines Agency-recommended treatment length until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity, the optimal duration of immunotherapy remains to be defined. In a retrospective study, we retrieved from the Danish Metastatic Melanoma Database (DAMMED), all patients that were annotated as a partial or complete response based on the computed tomography (CT) of serial FDG-PET-CT scans. Patients treated with an anti-Programmed Death (PD)-1-containing regimen for <18 months, and ≥4 months without disease progression after halting anti-PD-1 were included. Cases were divided into an ""elective"" and a ""toxicity"" group based on the reason for treatment discontinuation. A total of 140 patients were included. At 29.3 months of median follow-up, a higher proportion of patients remained alive in the ""elective"" group (93% vs 75%, P = .0031) with an improved melanoma-specific (HR 0.07, 95% CI 0.02-0.32, P = .0041) survival (MSS). Patients without FDG-avid lesions at the time of treatment discontinuation had an improved MSS (HR 0.03, 95% CI 0.01-0.17, P = .0002), and the absence of FDG-avid lesions was the only independent predictive feature of improved MSS in multivariate analysis. In conclusion, patients with metastatic melanoma who obtain an early response and early discontinue immunotherapy have an excellent prognosis, especially in the absence of FDG-PET avid lesions when discontinuing treatment. These data support the option of early discontinuation, limiting possible overtreatment and thereby toxicity, health and economic expenses and improving logistics."
1883,A multiscale integrated analysis of the factors characterizing the sustainability of food systems in Europe,"Jose Cadillo-Benalcazar, Juan; Renner, Ansel; Giampietro, Mario","Considering the existing world population, set of environmental impacts, and predicted changes in dietary trends, one can expect that, in the coming decades, food security will remain high on the list of sustainability concerns. In relation to this challenge, Europe's Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) must address a diverse set of goals: (i) guarantee a stable and affordable food supply; (ii) preserve the socioeconomic stability of farmers by guaranteeing their economic viability; (iii) protect the environment by reducing pressures on agroecosystems; and (iv) improve food security by reducing import dependence. Policies related to these diverse goals are likely to generate adverse side-effects. A particularly uncomfortable concern is Europe's massive reliance on imported feed commodities. The European Union (EU) is unlikely to be capable of domestically producing currently imported agricultural commodities and a significant move to internalize imports would dramatically increase pressures on local ecosystems. Faced with that potential predicament, it is essential to have a robust information system capable of simultaneously addressing a variety of policy concerns. In response, this paper presents a novel accounting framework-Multi-Scale Integrated Analysis of Societal and Ecosystem Metabolism (MuSIASEM)- capable of generating an integrated set of indicators entangled across different scales and dimensions of analysis. Our versatile approach establishes a set of quantitative relations between: (i) the dietary intake of the society (desirability of the food supply); (ii) processes under human control (viability of the food system); (iii) processes outside of human control and associated with external biophysical limits determined by embedding ecosystems (feasibility of the food system); and (iv) the dependence on imported products (food security). The analysis of such relations can be tailored to the legitimate perceptions of different social actors affected by policies, anticipating potential conflicts and providing useful information for deliberation and negotiation. Our approach is illustrated with an analysis of the European agricultural system, covering the EU-27 plus the UK and Norway."
1884,"Physicochemical, Antibacterial Properties, and Compatibility of ZnO-NP/Chitosan/β-Glycerophosphate Composite Hydrogels","Pingping Huang,Wen Su,Rui Han,Hao Lin,Jing Yang,Libin Xu,Lei Ma,Pingping Huang,Wen Su,Rui Han,Hao Lin,Jing Yang,Libin Xu,Lei Ma","In this study we aimed to develop novel ZnO-NP/chitosan/β-glycerophosphate (ZnO-NP/CS/β-GP) antibacterial hydrogels for biomedical applications. According to the mass fraction ratio of ZnO-NPs to chitosan, mixtures of 1, 3, and 5% ZnO-NPs/CS/β-GP were prepared. Using the test-tube inversion method, scanning electron microscopy and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, the influence of ZnO-NPs on gelation time, chemical composition, and cross-sectional microstructures were evaluated. Adding ZnO-NPs significantly improved the hydrogel's antibacterial activity as determined by bacteriostatic zone and colony counting. The hydrogel's bacteriostatic mechanism was investigated using live/dead fluorescent staining and scanning electron microscopy. In addition, crystal violet staining and MTT assay demonstrated that ZnO-NPs/CS/β-GP exhibited good antibacterial activity in inhibiting the formation of biofilms and eradicating existing biofilms. CCK-8 and live/dead cell staining methods revealed that the cell viability of gingival fibroblasts (L929) cocultured with hydrogel in each group was above 90% after 24, 48, and 72 h. These results suggest that ZnO-NPs improve the temperature sensitivity and bacteriostatic performance of chitosan/β-glycerophosphate (CS/β-GP), which could be injected into the periodontal pocket in solution form and quickly transformed into hydrogel adhesion on the gingiva, allowing for a straightforward and convenient procedure. In conclusion, ZnO-NP/CS/β-GP thermosensitive hydrogels could be expected to be utilized as adjuvant drugs for clinical prevention and treatment of peri-implant inflammation."
1885,Climate impact of an optimised gas treatment on old landfills,"Roland Berger,Joachim Lehner,Roland Berger,Joachim Lehner","It is a well-established fact that the quality and quantity of landfill gas (LFG) start declining after a landfill is closed to further waste intake. Conventional gas treatment and utilisation systems such as flares and gas-driven engines require a certain quality of LFG: specifically, a sufficient methane concentration. Various measures are utilised to maintain the necessary quality of LFG, including a turn-down of gas extraction rates and a shutdown of low-quality gas wells, resulting in a decline of LFG production. This, however, does not have to be the case. The low calorific value (LCV) LFG capture and treatment technology developed by e-flox and referred to in this article as 'LCV LFG System' can significantly increase the collection rate and the amount of treated methane in an old landfill. This article introduces such new treatment measures, describes gas capture calculation methodologies and presents actual results based on a medium-sized landfill in Germany. The study demonstrates, among other things, that the LCV LFG system can reduce the CO2 avoidance costs to roughly 10 €/tCO2eq. We present this new technology as a quick and straightforward measure of dealing with the climate issues related to methane emissions of old landfills."
1886,Water-energy nexus: Floating photovoltaic systems promoting water security and energy generation in the semiarid region of Brazil,"Campos Lopes, Mariana Padilha; Neto, Suda de Andrade; Castelo Branco, David Alves; Vasconcelos de Freitas, Marcos Aurelio; Fidelis, Neilton da Silva","Floating photovoltaic systems could be used to mitigate water supply issues by reducing the evaporation rate of water bodies such as weirs. This paper aims to estimate the potential evaporation prevented and the potential electrical energy generated by the installation of floating photovoltaic systems in specific weirs of the Brazilian semiarid region. Moreover, an economic feasibility analysis is carried out regarding energy and water supply. A net present value approach was used to conduct this analysis. The software System Advisor Model was employed to simulate and compare the performance of two photovoltaic systems in the region: floating and ground-mounted. Three scenarios of the surface cover are considered for the weirs: 1) the average area occupied by dead storage of all weirs; 2) 50% of the total area of weirs; 3) 70% of the total area of weirs. Results show that the installation of floating photovoltaic systems over weirs of the Apodi/Mossoro basin would potentially preserve 20.6 Mm(3) of water in scenario 1, 83.3 Mm(3) in 2 and 124.3 Mm(3) in 3. The annual electricity generation estimated in scenarios 1, 2, and 3 is 2.3 TWh, 8.6 TWh, and 12 TWh, respectively. Financial results show that when energy and water cash flows are considered together, payback time diminishes, and the project becomes more economically feasible. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

1887,Toxicokinetic of cyphenothrin in rabbits,"Ferhat Özen,Gökhan Eraslan,Ferhat Özen,Gökhan Eraslan","Type II pyrethroids, including cyphenothrin, have a wider efficacy and spectrum of action because they have a killing effect rather than a knockdown effect on pests. For this reason, they are among the most widely used pyrethroid groups today. In addition, this group also has repellent activity. Thus, cyphenothrin is a commonly used pyrethroid, which poses an exposure/toxicity risk for living organisms. Toxicokinetic studies have an important place in predicting the toxicity risks of compounds and evaluating viable treatment options. In this study, the toxicokinetics of cyphenothrin were investigated in rabbits. The animal material of the study comprised 6-month-old female 14 New Zealand rabbits, each weighing 2-2.5 kg. The animals were randomly assigned to two groups, each of 7 animals. The rabbits in group 1 were administered a single dose of 2.5 mg/kg bw cyphenothrin in dimethyl sulfoxide as an intravenous bolus, while the rabbits in group 2 were administered a single dose of 2.5 mg/kg bw cyphenothrin in the same vehicle as an oral bolus. Following the administration of cyphenothrin, blood samples were taken at certain intervals from the auricular vein into heparinized tubes. Plasma cyphenothrin levels were determined by gas chromatography, using a capillary column and a micro-electron capture detector. For orally administered cyphenothrin, the plasma maximum concentration (Cmax), time to reach the maximum value (tmax), half-life (t1/2β), mean residence time (MRT), area under the curve (AUC0→∞), and bioavailability (F) values were determined as 172.28 ± 47.30 ng/ml, 1.07 ± 0.42 h, 12.95 ± 1.11 h, 17.79 ± 1.69 h, 2220.07 ± 572.02 ng/h/ml, and 29.50%, respectively. For intravenous cyphenothrin, the t1/2β, MRT and AUC0→∞ values were ascertained as 7.66 ± 0.74 h, 9.28 ± 0.62 h, and 7524.31 ± 2988.44 ng/h/ml, respectively. Although the bioavailability of cyphenothrin was limited when taken orally, its half-life and mean residence time in the body were found to be long. This suggests that high doses of this pesticide may pose a poisoning risk."
1888,Analysis of Consumers' Willingness to Pay for Organic and Local Honey in Serbia,"Vapa-Tankosic, Jelena; Ignjatijevic, Svetlana; Kiurski, Jelena; Milenkovic, Jovana; Milojevic, Irena","In times of increased concern for human health and care for the environment, it is important to investigate the consumer behavior models in order to better manage the product supply. From the perspective of our research, it is important to learn about consumer attitudes, of a specific product, such as honey, so as to potentially strengthen the economic position of honey producers. The purpose of this article was to explore the consumers' perceptions of organic and local honey in the Republic of Serbia and identify factors that contribute to predicting consumers' willingness to pay (WTP) for organic and local honey. The ordinal regression was used to determine which factors influence the WTP for organic and local honey, and the findings show that the consumers were WTP more for organic honey than for local honey. Socio-economic characteristics of respondents and honey attributes affect consumers' WTP. The higher monthly household income positively influences the WTP for organic honey, while on the other hand, the higher level of education has a positive influence on the WTP for local honey. The WTP for organic honey positively affected by the perceived importance of honey attributes, such as food safety and support for the local community. The frequency of the purchase of the local honey, the recommendations for the local honey purchase and the perceived importance of attributes, such as the care for the environment and nutritional properties, have a positive influence on the consumers' WTP for local honey. From this, we can conclude that our understanding of all the factors that influence a consumer's decision to allocate budget expenses for honey can help all stakeholders in creating an adequate pricing and promotional strategy for honey products."
1889,How surfactants affect the depuration of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons adsorbed on the mangrove leaf surfaces: insight from an in situ method,"Shuai Guo,Chaoxian Wei,Yaxian Zhu,Yong Zhang,Shuai Guo,Chaoxian Wei,Yaxian Zhu,Yong Zhang","The effects of sodium dodecyl benzene sulfonate (SDBS), polyoxyethylene (20) sorbitan monolaurate (Tween 20), and their mixtures on the depuration of anthracene (Ant) and fluoranthene (Fla) individually adsorbed on the Kandelia obovata (Ko) leaf surfaces were in situ investigated. The Ko original leaf-wax microstructures have been destroyed by SDBS, Tween 20, and their mixtures at or above their critical micelle concentration (CMC). The volatilization rate constants (kV) of the adsorbed PAHs decreased with surfactants at or above their CMC resulting from the plasticizing effect and a decrease in the polarity of the Ko leaf-waxes induced by surfactants. Moreover, the photolysis rate constants (kP) of the adsorbed PAHs decreased with SDBS while increased with Tween 20 and their mixtures at or above their CMC, which can be attributed to effects of surfactants on the light adsorption behavior of Ko leaf-waxes. Overall, the effects of surfactants on the depuration of the adsorbed PAHs were dependent not only on the physical-chemical properties of surfactants but also on the micro-environment of the substrates adsorbed the PAHs. These results are of great significance for further understanding the accumulation of PAHs and could expand our knowledge about the migration mechanism of PAHs from the atmosphere by mangrove leaf surface micro-zones."

1891,Techno-economic and environmental assessment of the main biogas upgrading technologies,"Lombardi, Lidia; Francini, Giovanni","Five biogas-to-biomethane upgrading technologies were compared from the environmental and economic points of view: High-Pressure Water Scrubbing (HPWS), Amine Scrubbing (AS), Potassium Carbonate Scrubbing (PCS), Pressure Swing Adsorption (PSA) and Membrane Permeation (MP). Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) and Life Cycle Costing (LCC) methods were used for the comparison. In order to provide a wider picture of the conversion system and its impacts, the biogas production processes, starting from source sorted organic fraction of municipal solid waste, were included. The intention was to maintain the same object for the LCA and the LCC, given that the cost of biogas production had to be included for the calculation of the economic indicators. The cost analysis included also the evaluation of the external costs, derived from the monetization of the air emissions of the systems. The selected functional unit was the upgrading of 1 Nm(3) of raw biogas. Data were collected directly from companies providing upgrading plants and confirmed by literature review. A biogas-to-biomethane plant proved to have environmental and economic benefits and, as expected, for larger plant sizes the economic performances improved. AS showed the best environmental performances mainly due to its limited CH4 losses and lower electricity consumption. Considering the contribution from only the upgrading part, AS showed the lowest impacts for the global warming potential (GWP) indicator (respectively 13%, 1%, 23% and 3% less than HPWS, PCS, PSA and MP). However, the results changed for other impact categories: for human toxicity indicator PSA showed lower impacts compared to the other technologies, respectively 7%, 144%, 1% and 9% less compared to HPWS, AS, PCS and MP. For small size plants, HPWS proved to be slightly more cost-effective compared to other technologies. For large size plants, PCS showed the highest net present value. Moreover, the sensitivity analysis showed that the electricity consumption is a key parameter for the economic and environmental results. Its variation proved that for the 60% of cases AS was the best solution in terms of GWP, however 35% and 5% of cases respectively indicated that PCS and MP had the lowest GWP. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

1892,Carbon emissions and environmental management based on Big Data and Streaming Data: A bibliometric analysis,"Su, Yuan; Yu, Yanni; Zhang, Ning","Climate change and environmental management are issues of global concern. The advent of the era of Big Data has created a new research platform for the assessment of environmental governance and policies. However, little is known about Big Data application to climate change and environmental management research. This paper adopts bibliometric analysis in conjunction with network analysis to systematically evaluate the publications on carbon emissions and environmental management based on Big Data and Streaming Data using R package and VOSviewer software. The analysis involves 274 articles after rigorous screening and includes citation analysis, co-citation analysis, and co-word analysis. Main findings include (1) Carbon emissions and environmental management based on big data and streaming data is an emerging multidisciplinary research topic, which has been applied in the fields of computer science, supply chain design, transportation, carbon price assessment, environmental policy evaluation, and CO2 emissions reduction. (2) This field has attracted the attention of nations which are major contributors to the world economy. In particular, European and American scholars have made the main contributions to this topic, and Chinese researchers have also had great impact. (3) The research content of this topic is primarily divided into four categories, including empirical studies of specific industries, air pollution governance, technological innovation, and low-carbon transportation. Our findings suggest that future research should bring greater depth of practical and modeling analysis to environmental policy assessment based on Big Data."
1893,"Cybersyn, big data, variety engineering and governance","Raul Espejo,Raul Espejo","This contribution offers reflections about Chilean Cybersyn, 50 years ago. In recent years, Cybersyn, has received significant attention. It was the brainchild of Stafford Beer, who conceived it to support the transformation of the Chilean economy from its bureaucratic history to hopefully create a vibrant and modern society, driven by cybernetic tools. These aspects have received much attention in recent times; however, in this contribution, I want to discuss how working in Cybersyn influenced my work after the coup of 1973. Perhaps, for me, its major influence was in the management of complexity, through what I refer here as variety engineering and through the Viable System Model VSM as a paradigm to the management of relationships with implications to enterprises, society and the economy. After the 1973 coup major interest was in technological aspects of Cybersyn such as real-time management and its contribution to decision support and executive information systems. In the late 70s I was personally influenced by information management, but by the early 1980s my work moved towards methodological aspects of how to use the VSM. By 1989 I had created the VIPLAN method (Espejo, 1989). Key questions I attempted to answer were, how to model the complexity of enterprises and their interactions with environmental agents. Later on, in the 1990s and 2000s, the main direction of my work was epistemological, ontological and methodological towards second-order cybernetics and relationships. Only in recent decades the political transformations proposed by Cybersyn have captured the imagination of many commentators. The confluence of social and cultural changes with information technology, data models, artificial intelligence, algorithms and several additional technological developments have challenged the excesses of capitalism, particularly after the banking crisis of 2008-2009. The purpose in this paper is discussing this evolution in the light of those early days in Chile."
1894,"Does carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, and GHG emissions influence the agriculture? Evidence from China","Rehman, Abdul; Ma, Hengyun; Irfan, Muhammad; Ahmad, Munir","Carbon dioxide emission and greenhouse gas emissions are considered core issue in the world that influence agricultural production and also cause climate change. The present study seeks to investigate the linkage of methane emissions, nitrous oxide emissions, carbon dioxide emission, and greenhouse gas emissions with agricultural gross domestic product in China. The long-term association was checked by using an autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) bounds testing approach, fully modified least squares method, and canonical cointegrating regression analysis. The results from long-run analysis exposed that carbon dioxide emission and greenhouse gas emissions have positive coefficients that demonstrate the long-run linkage with the agricultural gross domestic product having p values of 0.5709 and 0.3751, respectively. Similarly, results also revealed that agricultural methane emissions and agricultural nitrous oxide emissions have a negative association with the agricultural gross domestic product having p values of 0.1737 and 0.0559. China is a huge emitter of CO2 emission and greenhouse gas emissions. Possible conservative policies are required to form the Chinese government to tackle this challenge to decrease CO2 emission in order to increase agricultural production."
1895,Curative resection of ureteral metastasis of rectal cancer: a case report and review of literature,"Yuki Matsui,Madoka Hamada,Yuki Matsumi,Mitsugu Sekimoto,Mitsuaki Ishida,Hironaga Satake,Hiroaki Kurokawa,Hidefumi Kinoshita,Yuki Matsui,Madoka Hamada,Yuki Matsumi,Mitsugu Sekimoto,Mitsuaki Ishida,Hironaga Satake,Hiroaki Kurokawa,Hidefumi Kinoshita","The metastasis to the ureter in colorectal cancer had been recognized at the stage of an autopsy. These days, according to the progression of diagnostic modalities, a few cases of long-time survival after curative surgery of metastatic ureteral tumor of colorectal cancer were reported. We present a case of a metastatic ureteral tumor of rectal cancer who had 32 months of recurrence-free survival after extirpation. After preoperative chemoradiotherapy, a 47-year-old man underwent laparoscopic low anterior resection and left unilateral pelvic node dissection for lower rectal cancer. He underwent several metastasectomies for recurrent tumors in the liver and lung. At the 42nd postoperative month, a contrast-enhanced CT scan showed thickening of the ureteral wall and left hydronephrosis. Transureteroscopic biopsy revealed metastatic adenocarcinoma of rectal cancer. At the 52nd postoperative month, partial ureteral resection and vesicoureteral neo-anastomosis were performed after confirming negative resection margin with rapid intraoperative pathology. He has 32 months of recurrence-free survival after metastasectomy of the left ureter. We review the literature presenting surgery of the metastatic ureteral tumor of colorectal cancer. Although it is a rare recurrence pattern, curative resection of ureteral metastasis might provide a possibility of long-time recurrence-free survival in such patients."
1896,"Economic, energy and environmental impact of coal-to-electricity policy in China: A dynamic recursive CGE study","Lin, Boqiang; Jia, Zhijie","In north China, many rural and urban residents still use coal for heating in winter. However, such method would result in a large amount of GHG emissions. China intends to change the heating method of its citizens from coal burning to electric heating to save energy, reduce emissions, which is called the project of Coal to Electricity (CtE). A dynamic recursive computable general equilibrium model is applied to analyze the real effect if the project is widely promoted in China. We found that CtE project is effective in reducing SO2 and NOx emission than CO2 emissions. In essence, energy substitution is not energy-saving, so the contribution to CO2 reduction of CtE project is limited. There is a certain co-benefit between CtE project and other energy saving policies (new energy generation, improving heating efficiency and building energy saving etc.). The findings indicate that single CtE policy can only bring better air quality. However, with other energy saving policies, CtE project can not only bring NOx and SO2 reduction, but also lead to less CO2 emissions and more convenient life. Multiple emission reduction measures are suggested to maximize the reduction effects of these policies. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."
1897,A fuzzy-stochastic multi-objective model for sustainable planning of a closed-loop supply chain considering mixed uncertainty and network flexibility,"Yu, Hao; Solvang, Wei Deng","Closed-loop supply chain network design (CLSCND) has been increasingly spotlighted over the latest decade. The focus has been given to maximize the economic performance, resource utilization and sustainability through incorporating a holistic decision-making on both forward and reverse logistics. In this paper, a new fuzzy-stochastic multi-objective mathematical model is formulated for sustainable CLSCND. The model aims at balancing the trade-off between cost effectiveness and environmental performance under different types of uncertainty. The environmental performance of CLSCND is measured by carbon emission. Moreover, the network flexibility is modeled and incorporated in the decision-making so that customer demands can be fulfilled by different means. In order to solve the complex optimization problem, the model is first defuzzilized and converted into an equivalent crisp form. Then, a sample average approximation based weighting method (SAAWM) is developed to obtain a set of Pareto optimal solutions between cost and carbon emission under different uncertain environments. The model is validated through a set of numerical experiments. The computational results show, through the incorporation with network flexibility, the proposed mathematical model and solution approach can effectively generate consistent objective values and solutions over different scenario trees and obtain robust strategic decisions on facility locations. Meanwhile, the flexibility and rationality of the decision-making on transportation management, demand allocation and facility operations can be improved as well. (c) 2020 The Authors.

1898,"Collective correlations, dynamics, and behavioural inconsistencies of the cryptocurrency market over time","Nick James,Max Menzies,Nick James,Max Menzies","This paper introduces new methods to study behaviours among the 52 largest cryptocurrencies between 01-01-2019 and 30-06-2021. First, we explore evolutionary correlation behaviours and apply a recently proposed turning point algorithm to identify regimes in market correlation. Next, we inspect the relationship between collective dynamics and the cryptocurrency market size-revealing an inverse relationship between the size of the market and the strength of collective dynamics. We then explore the time-varying consistency of the relationships between cryptocurrencies' size and their returns and volatility. There, we demonstrate that there is greater consistency between size and volatility than size and returns. Finally, we study the spread of volatility behaviours across the market changing with time by examining the structure of Wasserstein distances between probability density functions of rolling volatility. We demonstrate a new phenomenon of increased uniformity in volatility during market crashes, which we term volatility dispersion."
1899,Municipal solid waste management: Integrated analysis of environmental and economic indicators based on life cycle assessment,"Paes, Michel Xocaira; de Medeiros, Gerson Araujo; Mancini, Sandro Donnnini; Bortoleto, Ana Paula; Puppim de Oliveira, Jose A.; Kulay, Luiz Alexandre","This paper develops a method to analyze municipal solid waste management systems (MSWMS) that integrates environmental and economic indicators using Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) and Life Cycle Costing (LCC). The method was tested in the city of Sorocaba, Brazil, a medium size municipality typical of many developing countries. Environmental impacts were analyzed considering system expansion, which combined the aspects of primary production and recycling processes with the impacts of MSWMS. The economic analysis included operating and investment costs to the costs of environmental externalities, thus enabling the analysis of total costs to society. An integrated analysis of environmental indicators revealed that the most significant reductions in environmental impacts occurred in the scenarios with higher rates of reuse of dry waste through recycling (70%), which lowered these impacts by up to 50% when compared to the current scenario. An analysis of economic performance indicated that the two scenarios that combined the highest recycling goals with greater transport efficiency and more composting yielded the best results, reducing the total social costs by 31% and 33%, respectively. Lastly, the integration of environmental and economic analyses revealed that the best results are obtained by a combination of composting, mechanical biological treatment and recycling, which would reduce the impacts of MSWMS by up to 33.7 points per invested dollar. The results supports the application of this proposed integrate approach to improve the current solid waste management system in Sorocaba and in other cities with a similar system and waste generation.

1900,Impact Assessment of Additive Manufacturing on Sustainable Business Models in Industry 4.0 Context,"Godina, Radu; Ribeiro, Ines; Matos, Florinda; Ferreira, T. Bruna; Carvalho, Helena; Pecas, Paulo","Additive manufacturing has the potential to make a longstanding impact on the manufacturing world and is a core element of the Fourth Industrial Revolution. Additive manufacturing signifies a new disruptive path on how we will produce parts and products. Several studies suggest this technology could foster sustainability into manufacturing systems based on its potential of optimizing material consumption, creating new shapes, customizing designs and shortening production times that, all combined, will greatly transform some of the existing business models. Although it requires reaching a certain level of design maturity to completely insert this technology in an industrial setting, additive manufacturing has the potential to favorably impact the manufacturing sector by reducing costs in production, logistics, inventories, and in the development and industrialization of a new product. The transformation of the industry and the acceleration of the adopting rate of new technologies is driving organizational strategy. Thus, through the lenses of Industry 4.0 and its technological concepts, this paper aims to contribute to the knowledge about the impacts of additive manufacturing technology on sustainable business models. This aim is accomplished through a proposed framework, as well as the models and scales that can be used to determine these impacts. The effects are assessed by taking into account the social, environmental and economic impacts of additive manufacturing on business models and for all these three dimensions a balanced scorecard structure is proposed."

Drought and heat stress are becoming harder for cultivated crops. Cotton in Pakistan is grown under natural high temperature and low moisture, could be used as a source of heat and drought tolerance. Therefore, the study was conducted to morphological, physiological and molecular characterization of cotton genotypes under field conditions. A total of 25 cotton genotypes were selected from the gene pool of Pakistan based on tolerance to heat and drought stress. In field trail, the stress related traits like boll retention percentage, plant height, number of nodes and inter-nodal distance were recorded. In physiological assessment, traits such as photosynthesis rate, stomatal conductance, transpiration rate, leaf temperature, relative water content and excised leaf water loss were observed. At molecular level, a set of 19 important transcription factors, controlling drought/heat stress tolerance (HSPCB, GHSP26, HSFA2, HSP101, HSP3, DREB1A, DREB2A, TPS, GhNAC2, GbMYB5, GhWRKY41, GhMKK3, GhMPK17, GhMKK1, GhMPK2, APX1, HSC70, ANNAT8, and GhPP2A1) were analyzed from all genotypes. Data analyses depicted that boll retention percentage, photosynthesis, stomatal conductance, relative water content under the stress conditions were associated with the presence of important drought & heat TF/genes which depicts high genetic potential of Pakistani cotton varieties against abiotic stress. The variety MNH-886 appeared in medium plant height, high boll retention percentage, high relative water content, photosynthesis rate, stomatal conductance, transpiration rate and with maximum number transcription factors under study. The variety may be used as source material for heat and drought tolerant cotton breeding. The results of this study may be useful for the cotton breeders to develop genotype adoptable to environmental stresses under climate change scenario."

1904,Feasibility study and economic analysis of stand-alone hybrid energy system for southern Ghana,"Agyekum, Ephraim Bonah; Nutakor, Christabel","Ghana is endowed with lot of potentials in the renewable energy sector which are yet to be fully exploited. This research evaluated the techno-economic potentials of PV-Wind-DG-Battery and Wind-DG-Battery hybrid power plants in the southern part of Ghana in a town call Mankwadze to ascertain the bankability of the two systems for large-scale commercial electricity generation. The levelized cost of energy (LCOE) and net present cost (NPC) metrics were used in the economic analysis of the modelled power plants. The LCOE and NPC of the two systems were estimated at 0.382 $/kWh and $8,649,054 for the PV-Wind-DG-Battery system, respectively, whiles the Wind-DG-Battery system also recorded 0.396 $/kWh and $8,966,700 for the LCOE and NPC, respectively. The base case (generator) recorded an LCOE of 0.412 $/kWh and an OC of $345,998 with an initial cost of $454,256. The obtained results are all relatively higher than the current cost of energy for household consumers in Ghana, but a sensitivity analysis showed that the LCOEs can be reduced when certain parameters such as cost of fuel, discount and inflation rates are varied. This suggests that such projects can be done when the necessary investment climate is created by those in authority."
1905,Assessing the levelized cost of vanadium redox flow batteries with capacity fade and rebalancing,"Rodby, Kara E.; Carney, Thomas J.; Gandomi, Yasser Ashraf; Barton, John L.; Darling, Robert M.; Brushett, Fikile R.","Redox flow batteries (RFBs) are an emerging technology suitable for grid electricity storage. The vanadium redox flow battery (VRFB) has been one of the most widely researched and commercialized RFB systems because of its ability to recover lost capacity via electrolyte rebalancing, a result of both the device configuration as well as the symmetry of the redox chemistry. Despite broad acknowledgement of the benefits of this differentiating feature to system resilience and longevity, assessments of its economic value to the VRFB system have thus far been limited. Here we develop a techno-economic framework that incorporates a physical model of capacity fade and recovery from rebalancing and other servicing methods into a levelized cost of storage (LCOS) metric. We then evaluate the impacts of different contributing factors to the LCOS of a VRFB and identify opportunities for cost reduction through operating strategies (e.g., rebalancing schedule), performance improvements (e.g., reducing fade rates), design decisions (e.g., battery sizing), and investment approaches (e.g., electrolyte leasing). We anticipate this analysis will provide new insights into the cost-drivers for VRFBs and motivate further research efforts in understudied yet important areas."
1906,Levelised Cost of Storage (LCOS) analysis of liquid air energy storage system integrated with Organic Rankine Cycle,"Tafone, Alessio; Ding, Yulong; Li, Yongliang; Xie, Chunping; Romagnoli, Alessandro","Liquid Air Energy Storage (LAES) is a unique decoupled grid-scale energy storage system that stores energy through air liquefaction process. In order to further increase the utilization ratio of the available waste heat discharged by the air compression and not effectively recovered during the discharge phase, the authors have previously investigated the thermodynamic feasibility of different integrated LAES systems and promising results have been shown for the LAES coupled with Organic Rankine Cycle (integrated system LAORC). In order to assess the economic feasibility of the integrated system, this paper presents a techno-economic comparative analysis of the stand-alone LAES and the integrated system LAORC. The LAES systems have been designed by means of the quasi non-dimensional maps developed by the authors and the Levelised Cost of Storage (LCOS) has been employed to evaluate the economic viability of the investment by also comparing the LAES with Li-ion batteries. The results show that the stand-alone LAES system is generally cost-competitive with Li-ion batteries and even more in LAORC integrated system with the advantage of additional power output from the ORC. When LAES is operated in cogenerative configuration, the LAORC integrated system produces the most significant results decreasing the LCOS by 10%. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."
1907,The effect of FDI on environmental emissions: Evidence from a meta-analysis,"Demena, Binyam Afewerk; Afesorgbor, Sylvanus Kwaku","One important and frequently-raised issue about foreign direct investment (FDI) is the potentially negative consequences for the environment. The potential environmental cost due to increased emissions may undermine the economic gains associated with increases in FDI inflow. Although the literature is dominated with this adverse view of FDI on the environment, there is also a possibility that FDI can contribute to a cleaner environment, especially, if FDI comes with green technologies and this creates spillovers for domestic industries. Theoretically, the effect of FDI on the environment can be negative or positive. To deal with the theoretical ambiguity about the FDI-environment nexus, many empirical studies have been conducted but their results only reinforce the controversy as they produce contrasting results. We conduct a meta-analysis of the effect of FDI on environmental emissions using 65 primary studies that produce 1006 elasticities. Our results show that the underlying effect of FDI on environmental emissions is close to zero, however, after accounting for heterogeneity in the studies, we find that FDI significantly reduces environmental emissions. Results remain robust after disaggregating the effect for countries at different levels of development as well as for different pollutants."
1908,Experimental study of hydrogen enriched compressed natural gas (HCNG) engine and application of support vector machine (SVM) on prediction of engine performance at specific condition,"Hao, Duan; Mehra, Roopesh Kumar; Luo, Sijie; Nie, Zhibin; Ren, Xiaohui; Ma Fanhua","The effect of excess air ratio (A) and ignition advance angle (Big) on the combustion and emission characteristics of hydrogen enriched compressed natural gas (HCNG) on a 6 cylinder compressed natural gas (CNG) engine has been experimental studied in an engine test bench, aiming at enriching the sophisticated calibration of HCNG fueled engine and increasing the prediction accuracy of the SVM method on automobile engines. Three different fuel blends were selected for the experiment: 0%, 20% and 40% volumetric hydrogen blend ratios. It is noted that combustion intensity varies with the excess air ratio and the ignition advance angle, so are the emissions. The optimal value of A or Big has been explored in the specific engine condition. Results show that blending hydrogen can enhance and advance the combustion and stability of CNG engine, and it also has some benefic influence on the emissions such as reducing the CO and CH4. Meanwhile, a simulation research on forecasting the engine performance by using the support vector machine (SVM) method was conducted in detail. The torque, brake specific fuel consumption and NOx emission have been selected to characterize the power, economic and emissions of the engine with various HCNG fuels, respectively. It can be seen that the optimal model built by the SVM method can highly describe the relationship of the engine properties and condition parameters, since the value of the complex correlation coefficient is larger than 0.97. Secondly, the prediction performance of the optimal model for torque or BSFC is much better than the case of NOx. Besides, the optimal model built by the PSO optimization method has the best prediction accuracy, and the accuracy of the model obtained based on the training group with 20% hydrogen blend ratio is the best compared with those of others. The upshots in this article provide experimental support and theoretical basis for the adoption of HCNG fuel on internal combustion engines as well as the application of intelligent algorithmic in the engine calibration technology field.

1909,Entrepreneurial Leadership and Sustainable Performance of Manufacturing SMEs in Malaysia: The Contingent Role of Entrepreneurial Bricolage,"Nor-Aishah, Hassan; Ahmad, Noor Hazlina; Thurasamy, Ramayah","The purpose of this research is to delve into the effect of entrepreneurial leadership (EL) on the economic, environmental, and social aspects of sustainable performance; the research also focuses on the contingency role of entrepreneurial bricolage (EB). The increasing concern focused on the triple bottom line (TBL) issues has triggered enthusiasm and inspiration in the field of sustainable entrepreneurship, especially amongst the small medium enterprise (SME) owners or leaders who are directly responsible for organizational sustainable performance. This research examines the relationships between EL and economically sustainable performance (ECSPF), environmentally sustainable performance (ENSPF), and social sustainable performance (SOSPF); these relationships are contingent upon EB through the lens of Upper Echelons Theory (UET) and Effectuation Theory (ET). A total of 146 responses from a cross-sectional survey from Malaysian manufacturing SMEs were investigated using Partial Least Squares-Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM). The findings reveal that EL has significant effects on ENSPF and SOSPF, but has an insignificant effect on ECSPF. Meanwhile, EB does not play the contingent role in strengthening the relationships between EL and ECSPF, EL and ENSPF, and EL and SOSPF. This research highlights the importance of EL and shows that SME owners or leaders should embrace and develop their skills as a crucial step towards achieving sustainable performance for their companies. The implications and limitations of the research are discussed and recommendations for future research are also presented."

The present work aims to study the removal of Polyvinylpyrrolidone-coated silver nanoparticles (PVP-Ag-NPs) using Aspergillus niger and depict the role of exopolysaccharides in the removal process. Our results show that the majority of PVP-Ag-NPs were attached to fungal pellets. About 74% and 88% of the PVP-Ag-NPs were removed when incubated with A. niger pellets and exopolysaccharide-induced A. niger pellets, respectively. Ionized Ag decreased by 553 and 1290-fold under the same conditions as compared to stock PVP-Ag-NP. PVP-Ag-PVP resulted in an increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) in 24 h. Results show an increase in PVP-Ag-NPs size from 28.4 to 115.9 nm for A. niger pellets and 160.3 nm after removal by stress-induced A. niger pellets and further increased to 650.1 nm for in vitro EPS removal. The obtained findings show that EPS can be used for nanoparticle removal, by increasing the net size of nanoparticles in aqueous media. This will, in turn, facilitate its removal through conventional filtration techniques commonly used at wastewater treatment plants."

It is always accompanied by a series of other cardiac malformations that affect the surgical intervention strategy as well as prognosis. In this study, we comprehensively analyzed the phenotypes of the patients who had TGA with concordant atrioventricular and discordant ventriculoarterial connections and explored their association with prognosis. Methods and Results We retrospectively reviewed 666 patients with a diagnosis of TGA with concordant atrioventricular and discordant ventriculoarterial connections in Fuwai Hospital from 1997 to 2019. Under the guidance of the Human Phenotype Ontology database, patients were classified into 3 clusters. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to analyze the prognosis, and the Cox proportional regression model was used to investigate the risk factors. In this 666-patient TGA cohort, the overall 5-year survival rate was 94.70% (92.95%-96.49%). Three clusters with distinct phenotypes were obtained by the Human Phenotype Ontology database. Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed a significant difference in freedom from reintervention among 3 clusters (P<0.001). To eliminate the effect of surgeries, we analyzed patients who only received an arterial switch operation and still found a significant difference in reintervention (P=0.019). Conclusions We delineated a big cardiovascular phenotypic profile of an unprecedentedly large TGA cohort and successfully risk stratified them to reveal prognostic significance. Also, we reported the outcomes of a large TGA population in China."
1912,Does Emission Trading Boost Carbon Productivity? Evidence from China's Pilot Emission Trading Scheme,"Zhou, Di; Liang, Xiaoyu; Zhou, Ye; Tang, Kai","As the country with the largest carbon emissions globally, the effective operation of China's carbon emissions trading scheme (ETS) is of great importance to the global community in terms of mitigating climate change. This paper considers China's pilot ETS launched in 2013 as a quasi-natural experiment. Exploring provincial industrial-level data that are more in line with the ETS coverage, the difference-in-difference-in-difference (DDD) model is used to evaluate the impact of the ETS on carbon productivity. Considering different pilot regions and industries, we also analyze the heterogeneous effect of ETS. Moreover, the mediating effects of technical progress and capital investment are explored. We find that China's pilot ETS boosted carbon productivity. Among pilot regions, the best policy effectiveness appeared in Beijing, while the weakest effectiveness appeared in Chongqing. Among the pilot industries, the pilot ETS had better effectiveness in petrochemical and electric power industries and weaker effectiveness in building materials and transportation industries. Additionally, the pilot ETS promoted carbon productivity through both technological progress and capital investment, and the former contributed more. Our findings can provide empirical references and policy implications for nationwide implementation of ETS to further promote low-carbon economic transformation."

During the period of the pandemic, we explore such relationship by resorting to the wavelet coherence and gaussian graphical model (GGM) frameworks. Wavelet analysis enables us to measure the dynamics of the causal effect of the novel covid-19 pandemic in the time-frequency space. Regarding the findings displayed herein, we first found that the COVID-19 pandemic has a severe influence on oil prices, stock market indices, and the economic uncertainty. Second the intensity of the causality effect is stronger in the longer horizon than in the short ones, suggesting that the causality exercise continues. Our findings also provide evidence that the COVID-19 pandemic and oil price changes in oil-importing countries mirror those in oil-exporting countries and vice versa. Further, the COVID-19 pandemic has a profound immediate time-frequency effect on the US, Japanese, South Korean, Indian, and Canadian economic uncertainties. A better understanding of oil and stock market prices in the oil-importing and oil-exporting countries is vital for investors and policymakers, specially since the novel unprecedented COVID-19 crisis has been recognized among the most serious ever happened. Thus, the findings suggest that the authorities should strongly take efficient actions to minimize risk."

Corporate Social Responsibility and Human Resource Management have become very powerful tools within companies. However, the potential, development, and measurement of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) and Human Resource Management (HRM) have not been sufficiently explored. The literature has developed multiple case studies on CSR and HRM and has studied the combination of both factors and their link to economic, environmental, and social sustainability, but has not yet found a solid basis from which to address the new functionality of CSR, HRM, and sustainable business management. This work aims to investigate trends in scientific production related to Corporate Social Responsibility and Human Resource Management. Bibliometric techniques and SciMAT software have been used for this purpose. A total of 314 articles from Web of Science (WOS) indexed journals were analyzed. The results obtained confirm that the interest in the study of these concepts has grown exponentially in the last decade. It should be noted that the definitions of CSR and HRM, and even the relationship between the two, continue to be subject to multiple interpretations. The contribution of this work lies in the fact that, through the longitudinal analysis carried out, light is shed on the groups of issues that emerge with special projection, such as green-management, stakeholders, commitment, competitive-advantage, satisfaction, performance, sustainability, or research-methods-analysis, and which must continue to be explored in order to respond to the demands that business organizations have in this respect, and to help the total integration of the different approaches related to CSR and HRM."
1915,The influence of consumers' intention factors on willingness to pay for renewable energy: a structural equation modeling approach,"Irfan, Muhammad; Zhao, Zhen-Yu; Li, Heng; Rehman, Abdul","As the adoption of renewable power generation technologies (RPTs) is a complex and multidimensional process influenced by a variety of factors, it provokes traction among researchers to identify these influencing factors. This study aims to investigate the impact of consumers' intention factors on willingness to pay (WTP) for renewable energy (RE) in Pakistan. The current research has contributed through expanding the theoretical framework of the theory of planned behavior by adding two new constructs, i.e., belief about RE cost and environmental concern to better understand consumers' intentions towards adoption or prohibition of RPTs. Findings are based on the primary data gathered from 349 residents in the five major cities of Pakistan including, Karachi, Lahore, Faisalabad, Rawalpindi, and Multan by conducting a comprehensive survey. Structural equation modeling was employed for data analysis purposes. Research results indicate that the influencing factors such as attitude, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control positively moderate the relationship between consumer's intention and WTP for RE, belief about RE cost has a negative effect, while environmental concern did not find to have a significant effect. Based on research findings, this study offered essential policy recommendations to fulfill the country's energy needs on its way to a future of sustainable development."

1917,Development and application of a machine learning based multi-objective optimization workflow for CO2-EOR projects,"You, Junyu; Ampomah, William; Sun, Qian","Carbon dioxide-Enhanced Oil Recovery (CO2-EOR) is known as one of techniques for hydrocarbon production improvement as wells as an important candidate to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Thus, an ideal development strategy for a CO2-EOR project would consider multiple objectives including to maximize oil recovery, CO2 storage volume and project economic outcomes. This work proposes a robust computational framework that couples artificial neural network (ANN) and multi-objective optimizers to optimize the aforementioned objectives in CO2-EOR processes simultaneously. Expert ANN systems are trained and employed as surrogate models of the high-fidelity compositional simulator in the optimization workflow. The robustness of the development optimization protocol is confirmed via a synthetic injection-pattern-base case study. Afterward a field implementation to Morrow-B formation to optimize the tertiary recovery stage of the field development is discussed. This work compares the optimum solution found using an aggregate objective function and the solution repository (Pareto front) generated by the multi-objective optimization process. The comparison indicates the existence of potential multi-solutions satisfying certain criteria in a CO2-EOR project designing, which cannot be found using traditional weighted sum method.

Alpha and γ haemolytic cultures were tested for their antibiotic resistance, antibacterial spectrum, acid and bile tolerance, adhesion ability (auto-aggregation, co-aggregation and hydrophobicity) and phenol tolerance. Safety criteria included evaluation of virulence genes and cytotoxicity percentages. Bacillus isolates inhibited both Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogens including Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococcus faecalis and Streptococcus mutans, while none could inhibit Listeria monocytogenes. Among the isolates, Bacillus subtilis ZH05, ZB03 and ZG025 showed resistance to most of the tested antibiotics and were considered unsafe. B. subtilis (4) and B. licheniformis (1) tolerated acidic pH and bile conditions, never the less were more tolerant in simulated intestinal conditions vis-a-vis gastric conditions. In 0·5% phenol concentrations, B. licheniformis ZH02 showed highest growth, while, B. subtilis ZG029 demonstrated highest auto-aggregation (65 ± 4·6) and hydrophobicity (23 ± 3·6) percentages (P < 0·05). The isolates lacked virulence genes (hblA, hblC, hblD, nhe, cytK and ces), and their cytotoxic percentage on Caco-2 cell lines was ˂15%. Overall, honeybees appear to be a good source of Bacillus species exhibiting typical in vitro probiotic properties, which could be of commercial interest."
1919,Spatial and temporal differentiation of COVID-19 epidemic spread in mainland China and its influencing factors,"Xie, Zhixiang; Qin, Yaochen; Li, Yang; Shen, Wei; Zheng, Zhicheng; Liu, Shirui","This paper uses the exploratory spatial data analysis and the geodetector method to analyze the spatial and temporal differentiation characteristics and the influencing factors of the COVID-19 (corona virus disease 2019) epidemic spread in mainland China based on the cumulative confirmed cases, average temperature, and socioeconomic data. The results show that: (1) the epidemic spread rapidly from January 24 to February 20, 2020, and the distribution of the epidemic areas tended to be stable over time. The epidemic spread rate in Hubei province, in its surrounding, and in some economically developed cities was higher, while that in western part of China and in remote areas of central and eastern China was lower. (2) The global and local spatial correlation characteristics of the epidemic distribution present a positive correlation. Specifically. the global spatial correlation characteristics experienced a change process from agglomeration to decentralization. The local spatial correlation characteristics were mainly composed of the'high-high' and 'low-low' clustering types, and the situation of the contiguous layout was very significant. (3) The population inflow from Wuhan and the strength of economic connection were the main factors affecting the epidemic spread, together with the population distribution, transport accessibility, average temperature, and medical facilities, which affected the epidemic spread to varying degrees. (4) The detection factors interacted mainly through the mutual enhancement and nonlinear enhancement, and their influence on the epidemic spread rate exceeded that of single factors. Besides, each detection factor has an interval range that is conducive to the epidemic spread. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."
1920,Head control and head-trunk coordination as a function of anticipation in sidestepping,"Samuel Zeff,Gillian Weir,Joseph Hamill,Richard van Emmerik,Samuel Zeff,Gillian Weir,Joseph Hamill,Richard van Emmerik","Head reorientation precedes body reorientation during direction change to facilitate gaze realignment, thus enhancing perceptual awareness. Whole body kinematics are dependent on the available planning time. The purpose of this study was to assess the role of anticipation on head control and head-trunk coordination during sidestepping tasks. Fourteen male collegiate athletes performed anticipated and unanticipated sidestepping tasks. Transverse plane head, trunk and heading direction, as well as head-trunk coordination were assessed. During change of direction tasks, we observed greater head orientation towards the new travel direction, followed by heading direction and then trunk direction during both anticipated and unanticipated tasks. With reduced planning time, heading in the preparatory phase and trunk rotation in the preparatory and stance phases were significantly less oriented towards the new travel direction, with no differences in head rotation. During anticipated sidestepping, significantly greater in-phase coordination was observed during the preparatory phase compared to unanticipated sidestepping. Head reorientation facilitates gaze realignment and may be prioritized irrespective of planning time during sidestepping tasks. During anticipated trials, the head and trunk move more synchronously compared to unanticipated sidestepping, highlighting the potential benefits of aligning the degrees of freedom earlier in the change of direction stride and optimizing perceptual awareness."
1921,Insights on the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals scope: Are they aligned with a 'strong' sustainable development?,"Giannetti, Biagio F.; Agostinho, Feni; Almeida, Cecilia M. V. B.; Liu, Gengyuan; Contreras, Luis E., V; Vandecasteele, Carlo; Coscieme, Luca; Sutton, Paul; Poveda, Carlos","The seventh edition of the International Workshop ""Advances in Cleaner Production"" (IWACP) was held at Universidad de La Costa, Colombia, in June 2018. Thematic sections were held for allowing theoretical discussions and practical activities, with the main goal of supporting discussions on the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UN-SDGs). Participants provided their perception on the allocation of UN-SDGs as relevant for managing the main forms of capital (environmental, economic and social) within two different sustainability conceptual models: a ""traditional"" model (representing the interdependence and substitutability among the environment, social and economic capitals), and the five sectors sustainability model (5SenSu). Results show an unbalanced distribution of SDGs among the capitals for both sustainability models, with social capital perceived as the most relevant across the SDGs. Particularly, the environment as a resource provider supporting societal development is perceived as relevant only for SDG 6 (Clean Water and Sanitation). The main outcomes of the workshop emphasize the need for further efforts towards a more objective interpretation of policy goals in post Agenda-2030 initiatives. The SDGs must be clearly understood and have a scientific resonance to objectively support public policies. Sustainability models, such as the 5SenSu, have the potential to support a more balanced definition of sustainable development goals across the different dimensions of sustainability.

1922,Microplastics in Mexican beaches,"Carlos Alvarez-Zeferino, Juan; Ojeda-Benitez, Sara; Areanely Cruz-Salas, Arely; Martinez-Salvador, Carolina; Vazquez-Morillas, Alethia","Mexican sandy beaches are a natural resource that provides environmental services and contribute to the economic growth of the country. However, due to mismanagement of solid waste, discharges of wastewaters and other land and marine activities, they can be polluted by microplastics. This research aimed to quantify and classify the microplastics found in Mexican beaches. Samples were taken in 33 beaches, along the five marine regions of the country, following a systematic method that allows comparison of results. Microplastics concentration varied from 31.7-545.8 M P/m(2), with high variance coefficients (28.7-122.3 %). The Gulf of California was the region that showed a higher mean concentration. Presence of microplastics was higher in urban-overdeveloped beaches and increased with the occurrence of extreme weather events. Prevention of pollution of beaches by microplastics would allow to preserve the natural resources of the country, as well as to recover valuable materials that can be reinserted in production cycles."
1923,The impact of energy technology innovations on cleaner energy supply and carbon footprints in Europe: A linear versus nonlinear approach,"Altintas, Halil; Kassouri, Yacouba","Providing more affordable and cleaner energy for all raises complex and significant financial, political, technical, and institutional issues, which must all be addressed to ensure sustainable development. Energy technology innovation has a critical role to play as one of the best pathways to achieve the transition to a global clean energy system. This paper is an endeavor to study the impact of government energy technology research, development, and demonstration (RD&D) budget, which is the primary input of energy technology innovations on cleaner energy supply and carbon footprints (CFP). In this study, a cleaner energy supply is measured as the contribution of renewable energy to total primary energy supply (RE). We assumed that the effect of energy innovation is not uniform but varies according to the descending and ascending movements in a government's energy technology RD&D budget. To this end, we distinguished the impact of the descending and ascending movements in government energy technology RD&D budgets on cleaner energy supply, and CFP in Europe over the period 1985 to 2016. Additionally, we carried out a comparative examination of the effects of energy technology RD&D expenditures on RE and CFP under both linear and nonlinear panel techniques. To increase room for policy implications, we also controlled for the role of economic growth and trade openness and performed several robustness check analyses. We found that the reduction of carbon footprints associated with an increase in public support to energy technology RD&D is more pronounced than the contribution of energy technology innovation to the deployment of renewable energy in Europe. This study provided little evidence in favor of the effectiveness of a government energy technology RD&D budget to substantially boost renewable energy in Europe. Following these results, we suggest that the knowledge of the asymmetric linkage between public energy technology innovation, RE, and CFP is a starting point to achieve win-win solutions that favor clean energy and environmental sustainability.

1924,An innovative 'Prop technique' of mouth opening in post-COVID-19 mucormycosis maxillectomy: Finding a new way with minimal efforts,"Manisha Sapate,Ashwini Munde,Harsha Narkhede,Ajit Mane,Manisha Sapate,Ashwini Munde,Harsha Narkhede,Ajit Mane","General anaesthesia is associated with damage to teeth, particularly during laryngoscopy. Dental injury is more probable when pre-existing dental pathology or risk factors are present. Post-coronavirus disease -2019 mucormycosis is a rare, fulminant, lethal, angio-invasive, opportunistic fungal disease and is increasingly recognised in diabetic and immunocompromised patients. Since the flange of the laryngoscope blade appears to be the source of tooth injury, alternate methods of wide mouth opening during laryngoscopy should be examined, especially when mouth opening is limited. In this case series, we have studied 12 cases of maxillectomies with an aim to improve restricted mouth opening by using the 'Prop technique' resulting in a minimum hinging force of the flange of the blade on teeth. Preoperatively, patients were warned about the possibility of dental injuries during anaesthesia or surgery."

As dominance interactions are costly, individuals should be strategic in whom they interact with. One hypothesis is that individuals should direct costly interactions towards those closest in rank, as they have most to gain-in terms of attaining or maintaining dominance-from winning such interactions. Here, we show that male vulturine guineafowl (Acryllium vulturinum), a gregarious species with steep dominance hierarchies, strategically express higher-cost aggressive interactions towards males occupying ranks immediately below themselves in their group's hierarchy. By contrast, lower-cost aggressive interactions are expressed towards group members further down the hierarchy. By directly evaluating differences in the strategic use of higher- and lower-cost aggressive interactions towards competitors, we show that individuals disproportionately use highest-cost interactions-such as chases-towards males found one to three ranks below themselves. Our results support the hypothesis that the costs associated with different interaction types can determine their expression in social groups with steep dominance hierarchies. This article is part of the theme issue 'The centennial of the pecking order: current state and future prospects for the study of dominance hierarchies'."
1926,An urgent call for circular economy advocates to acknowledge its limitations in conserving biodiversity,"Buchmann-Duck, Johanna; Beazley, Karen F.","This discussion paper explores the relationship between biodiversity and the circular economy and the potential implications of this relationship. The circular economy has emerged as an alternativemodel to a traditional linear economy. It aims to tackle the resource exploitation that accompanies a linear economy and decouple economic growth from reliance on primary resources. In the face of global environmental degradation and an urgent need for change, the concept has become popular around the world and has led to the release of national policies and strategies on the circular economy. Problematically, while the basic concept is clear, it is ambiguous in howitwill achieve some of its objectives, and it fails to address some key issues. In light of the accelerating rate of change, precipitous biodiversity decline is one such key issue. Through a content analysis of relevant circular economy publications, authors demonstrate that biodiversity protection is rarely mentioned in theory and policy. While the circular economy holds many benefits for society, its evasion of scrutiny has prevented it from manifesting in a comprehensive solution to environmental issues. The circular economy advocates for biomimicry, ecosystem service valuation, bioeconomy, and renewable energy. Each of these, however, has its own set of conflicts with biodiversity protection. Given the imminent need to protect biodiversity, the authors call for further research on the interaction between biodiversity and the circular economy, and for circular economy advocates to explicitly acknowledge the concept's limitations, thereby revealing the need for intersectional and complementary policies which aim to protect biodiversity.

1927,Environmental courts and foreign direct investments: evidence from China,"Xiaoqi Huang,Wei Liu,Zhi Cao,Xiaoqi Huang,Wei Liu,Zhi Cao","As China's pollution problems worsen, environmental disputes are increasing rapidly. However, only 1% of environmental disputes can be resolved via judicial channels. Based on the establishment of environmental courts since 2007, we employ the multi-period DID approach to investigate the impact of environmental courts on foreign direct investments. We find that (1) compared with cities without environmental courts, FDI of cities with environmental courts would drop by 3.32% from the average, which is consistent with the pollution haven hypothesis. Besides, we verify the credibility of the conclusion through detailed endogeneity discussions, placebo tests, and robustness tests. (2) The negative effect of environmental courts on foreign direct investments is more salient in the east, regions with higher historical environmental investment, and regions with more serious local protectionism. (3) There are two channels. The greater risks of environmental litigation and stricter environmental public supervision brought by environmental courts would lead to additional environmental violation costs, thereby inhibiting foreign direct investments. Our findings provide new causal evidence for the pollution haven hypothesis from the perspective of intensive environmental justice."
1928,Modulation of soluble guanylate cyclase ameliorates pulmonary hypertension in a rat model of chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension by stimulating angiogenesis,"John Zagorski,Evandro Neto-Neves,Nathan J Alves,Amanda J Fisher,Jeffrey A Kline,John Zagorski,Evandro Neto-Neves,Nathan J Alves,Amanda J Fisher,Jeffrey A Kline","Acute pulmonary embolism (PE) does not always resolve after treatment and can progress to chronic thromboembolic disease (CTED) or the more severe chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH). The mechanisms surrounding the likelihood of PE resolution or progress to CTED/CTEPH remain largely unknown. We have developed a rat model of CTEPH that closely resembles the human disease in terms of hemodynamics and cardiac manifestations. Embolization of rats with polystyrene microspheres followed by suppression of angiogenesis with the inhibitor of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGF-R2) SU5416 results in transient, acute pulmonary hypertension that progresses into chronic PE with PH with sustained right ventricular systolic pressures exceeding 70 mmHg (chronic pulmonary embolism [CPE] model). This model is similar to the widely utilized hypoxia/SU5416 model with the exception that the ""first hit"" is PE. Rats with CPE have impaired right heart function characterized by reduced VO2 Max, reduced cardiac output, and increased Fulton index. None of these metrics are adversely affected by PE alone. Contrast-mediated CT imaging of lungs from rats with PE minus SU5416 show large increases in pulmonary vascular volume, presumably due to an angiogenic response to acute PE/PH. Co-treatment with SU5416 suppresses angiogenesis and produces the CTEPH-like phenotype. We report here that treatment of CPE rats with agonists for soluble guanylate cyclase, a source of cGMP which is in turn a signal for angiogenesis, markedly increases angiogenesis in lungs, and ameliorates the cardiac deficiencies in the CPE model. These results have implications for future development of therapies for human CTEPH."
1929,Comparative analysis on the evolution of ecological carrying capacity between provinces during urbanization process in China,"Wei, Xiaoxuan; Shen, Liyin; Liu, Zhi; Luo, Linyan; Wang, Jinhuan; Chen, Yang","Effective ecological carrying capacity (ECC) is the precondition for implementing sustainable urbanization in China. However, different regions in a big country such as China have different ecological conditions and different development modes. Therefore, the evolution of ECC is different between different regions during the urbanization process in China. This study presents a comparative analysis on the evolution of ecological carrying capacity between provinces in the context of China. The ECC indicators in this study are classified into four dimensions, namely, water carrying capacity, land carrying capacity, environment carrying capacity and energy carrying capacity. Indicator data used for analysis are collected from 30 provinces in China. The entropy method is adopted to analyze the ECC performance during the years of 2006-2017. The ECC evolution is described into stable, fluctuated, declined and improved. This study shows that the evolution of ECC performance varies significantly between different provinces. The findings of this study help the Chinese government understand the different ECC evolution between provinces and provide policy-makers with valuable reference for formulating effective measures with considering different ecological conditions in different provinces, to improve the ECC performance across the country in China."

However, there are several look-alike species that can be marketed as Pulsatillae Radix. To distinguish P. chinensis (Bge.) Regel from its look-alikes, viz. Pulsatilla cernua (Thunb.) Bercht et Opiz., Pulsatilla dahurica (Fisch.) Spreng., Anemone tomeutosa (Maxim.) Pei., and Rhaponticum uniflorum (L.)

The results of this study provide an effective method for identifying and distinguishing P. chinensis (Bge.) Regel from similar plants."
1931,Can the incentives polices promote the diffusion of distributed photovoltaic power in China?,"Wang Wei,Zhao Xin-Gang,Wang Wei,Zhao Xin-Gang","Government incentive policies play an important role in the promotion of distributed photovoltaic power. However, which policy is more effective for the diffusion of distributed photovoltaic power? This is a question that needs to be answered. Based on this, we combined the two-factor learning curve and system dynamics model to study the dynamic diffusion process of China's distributed photovoltaic power (DSP). The results show that (1) the coefficients of learning by doing and learning by researching for DSP are 0.0435 and 0.2971 respectively. This indicates that technological innovation caused by R&D expenditures in the DSP is the driving force for cost reduction. (2) Both demand-pull and technology-push policies contribute to the diffusion of DSP; (3) the effect of FIT policy on the diffusion of distributed photovoltaic technology is more significant than that of R&D policy; and the reduction of production cost of photovoltaic power industry by R&D policy is more significant than FIT policy."

This study aims to assess the socio-economic burden of COVID-19 pandemic in Italy through the estimation of Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) and productivity loss. The observational study was based on data from official governmental sources collected since the inception of epidemic until 28 April 2020. DALYs for a disease combines the years of life lost due to premature mortality in the population and the years lost due to disability of the disease. In addition to DALYs, temporary productivity loss due to absenteeism from work and permanent productivity loss due to premature mortality were estimated using the Human Capital Approach. The total DALYs amount to 2.01 per 1000 persons. The total permanent productivity loss was around EUR 300 million while the temporary productivity loss was around EUR 100 million. This evaluation does not consider other economic aspects related to lockdown, quarantine of contacts, healthcare direct costs etc. The burden of disease methodology is functional metric for steering choices of health policy and allowing the government to be accountable for the utilization of resources."

Here, we achieve excellent thermoelectric properties in Sn0.99-xPbxZn0.01Se crystals via valence band convergence and point-defect engineering strategies. We demonstrate that Pb and Zn codoping converges the energy offset between multiple valence bands by significantly modifying the band structure, contributing to the enhancement of the Seebeck coefficient. The carrier concentration and electrical conductivity can be optimized, leading to an enhanced power factor. The dual-atom point-defect effect created by the substitution of Pb and Zn in the SnSe lattice introduces strong phonon scattering, significantly reducing the lattice thermal conductivity to as low as 0.284 W m-1 K-1. As a result, a maximum ZT value of 1.9 at 773 K is achieved in Sn0.93Pb0.06Zn0.01Se crystals along the bc-plane direction. This study highlights the crucial role of manipulating multiple electronic valence bands in further improving SnSe thermoelectrics."

In this paper, a comprehensive index system was built to estimate the coupling coordination between social economy and water environmental quality subsystems in Nansi Lake catchment, China. Improved coupling coordination degree (CCD) model, scissors difference and projection pursuit model based on genetic algorithm were developed to investigate the spatiotemporal distribution and dynamic evolution mechanism of coupling coordination in social economy-water environment system. Results showed that: (1) Comprehensive level of two subsystems showed an overall uptrend, water environmental quality in the catchment was improved gradually with socio-economic development. (2) The status of coupling coordination between two subsystems had transformed from moderately unbalanced development (CCD of 0.265 in 2001) to favorably balanced development (CCD of 0.667 in 2017). The relatively low CCD in Heze generated the biggest restriction on the coordinated development between two subsystems, compared to Zaozhuang and Jining. (3) The speed difference between two subsystems showed a downward trend, the scissor difference was controlled effectively. And the social economy-water environmental quality system gradually tended to the coordinated development. Overall, the improved CCD model and scissors difference analysis in this paper may provide a new approach for empirical research on environment-economy nexus. We hope this study can help decision makers formulate measures to promote the coordinated development between social economy and water environmental quality subsystems."
1935,Industrial structure transformation and provincial heterogeneity characteristics evolution of air pollution: Evidence of a threshold effect from China,"Zheng, You; Peng, Jiachao; Xiao, Jianzhong; Su, Panda; Li, Siyao","As an important link between human economic activities and air quality, industrial structure is the key factor in resolving the contradiction between economic development and the environment. By constructing a panel threshold model between China's air pollution and the industrial structure, this study analyzes and explores how industrial transformation influences air pollution as well as its provincial heterogeneity characteristics evolution. The results show that industrial structure has a three-stage influential mechanism on NOx pollution and PM2.5 pollution, and a two-stage influential mechanism on SO2 pollution. A decrease in proportion of the secondary industry output in GDP can significantly reduce NOx pollution and SO2 pollution. Industrial structure can change the effects of economic development on air pollution. China' s industrial structure has been continuously upgraded in the past decade. In the process of industrial structure transformation, energy consumption has always been a major factor in aggravating air pollution, whereas technological innovation has been an important way to reduce air pollution. Urbanization is another major factor exacerbating air pollution in the provinces where the service industry has always dominated the local economy. Based on the above research, the government should formulate corresponding industrial structure adjustment policies to reduce air pollution according to the provincial heterogeneity of industrial structure affecting different pollutants."
1936,Solving the duck curve in a smart grid environment using a non-cooperative game theory and dynamic pricing profiles,"Sheha, Moataz; Mohammadi, Kasra; Powell, Kody","With the intermittency that comes with electricity generation from renewables, utilizing dynamic pricing will encourage the demand-side to respond in a smart way that would minimize the electricity costs and flatten the net electricity demand curve. Determining the optimal dynamic pricing profile that would leverage distributed storage to flatten the curve is a novel idea that needs to be studied. Moreover, the economic feasibility of utilizing distributed electrical energy storage is still not given in the literature. Therefore, in this paper, a novel way of solving a citywide dynamic model using a bilevel programming algorithm is introduced. The problem is developed as a novel non-cooperative Stackelberg game that utilizes air-conditioning systems and electrical storage through the end-users to determine the optimal dynamic pricing profile. The results show that the combined effect of utilizing demand-side air-conditioning systems and distributed storage together can flatten the curve while employing the optimal dynamic pricing profile. An economic study is performed to determine the economic feasibility of 20 different cases with different battery designs and the level of solar penetration. Three metrics were used to evaluate the economic performance of each case: the levelized cost of storage, the levelized cost of energy, and the simple payback period. Most cases had levelized cost of storage values lower than 0.457 $/kWh, which is the lower bound available in the literature. Seven out of 16 cases have a simple payback period shorter than the lifetime of the system (25 years). The case with a 100 MW PV power plant and a battery storage of size 597 MWh, was found to be the most promising case with a simple payback period of 12.71 years for the photovoltaic plant and 19.86 years for the demand-side investments."
1937,The impact of financial development and globalization on environmental quality: evidence from South Asian economies,"Tahir, Tasmeena; Luni, Tania; Majeed, Muhammad Tariq; Zafar, Ayaz","Climate change resulting from the higher concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere is a threat to the sustainability of life on earth. To ensure sustainable development, the study analyzed the impact of financial development, globalization, and energy use on the environmental quality of South Asian economies over the period 1990-2014. To account for cross-sectional dependence, Breusch-Pagan-Lagrange multiplier, Pesaran-scaled Lagrange multiplier, bias-corrected-scaled Lagrange multiplier, and Pesaran cross-sectional dependence tests are used. The second-generation tests are used to determine the stationarity level of the variables. Furthermore, the Westerlund panel cointegration test confirms cointegration among the variables. For long-run association, fully modified ordinary least squares, dynamic ordinary least squares, and pooled mean group estimators are used. The results suggest that financial development contributes to carbon emissions, whereas globalization has the potential to control emissions. The study also used Dumitrescu and Hurlin's (2012) panel causality test to explore the causal relationship among the variables. Unidirectional causality is observed from economic growth, globalization, and financial development to environmental degradation and from emissions to energy use, respectively. As financial development deteriorates environmental quality, therefore, the government should monitor the disbursement of loans for research and development, green financing, and efficient production that reduce resource consumption and improves environmental quality. Financial development should not compromise environmental quality and endanger sustainability. Furthermore, South Asian countries should promote globalization to support the inflow of green technologies to enhance environmental quality."
1938,Spatial distribution and source analysis of heavy metals in soils influenced by industrial enterprise distribution: Case study in Jiangsu Province,"Wang, Yazhu; Duan, Xuejun; Wang, Lei","Heavy metal pollution is frequent in China and has received increasing attention globally. This study investigated the influence of Chinese industrialization and urbanization on soil environmental quality. Soil samples from Jiangsu Province were collected, the Cd, Pb, Cr, Cu, Zn, Hg, and As contents were measured, and their spatial variability structure, spatial distribution pattern, and pollution degree were analyzed. The mean values of Hg, Cd, Pb, Cr, Cu, and As were all higher than the background values in Jiangsu Province. Cr and As levels represented moderate pollution, Cu, Zn, Cd, and Pb represented mild pollution, Cr and As represented slight pollution, and Hg was not a pollutant. Spatial distribution patterns were both zonal and concentrated in nature. High concentrations of heavy metals were distributed in developed cities and industrial parks along the Yangtze River. Soil heavy metal pollution showed a decreasing trend from south to north, consistent with the economic gradient. Industrialization had the greatest influence on the spatial heterogeneity of heavy metal pollution. Cr, Cu, Zn, and As were affected by both natural and anthropogenic sources, while Cd and Pb were mainly affected by the latter. Hg was mainly derived from industrial activities such as petrochemical production. There was spatial consistency between industrial enterprise distribution and soil heavy metal pollution with a tendency toward composite pollution accumulated by multiple elements in the soil surrounding industries.

Since its discovery, the virus has spread globally, with 2,975,875 deaths as of 15 April 2021, and has had a huge impact on our health systems and economy. How to suppress the continued spread of new coronary pneumonia is the main task of many scientists and researchers. The introduction of artificial intelligence technology has provided a huge contribution to the suppression of the new coronavirus. This article discusses the main application of artificial intelligence technology in the suppression of coronavirus from three major aspects of identification, prediction, and development through a large amount of literature research, and puts forward the current main challenges and possible development directions. The results show that it is an effective measure to combine artificial intelligence technology with a variety of new technologies to predict and identify COVID-19 patients."
1940,The impact of international sanctions on environmental performance,"Fu, Qiang; Chen, Yin E.; Jang, Chyi-Lu; Chang, Chun-Ping","This paper studies the impact of international sanctions on environmental performance by using the panel fixed effect model for 22 sanctioned states over the period 2002-2016 while considering several cases of international sanctions (unilateral, plurilateral, U.S., EU, UN, economic, and intensity) and measures environmental performance by the Environmental Performance Index (EPI). Overall, we find that the imposition of unilateral, plurilateral, US., EU, and economic sanctions has a significantly negative impact on EPI, dropping their EPI scores respectively by 0.114,0.060,0.045,0.084, and 0.063, while a level increase of intensity results in EPI dropping by 0.028. Moreover, the simultaneous-equation models and Sobel tests show that the intermediate effect about GDP between international sanctions on environmental performance is significantly negative. We believe that our empirical findings can contribute to policy formulation by those sanctioned countries. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."
1941,Paeonol Ameliorates Cuprizone-Induced Hippocampal Demyelination and Cognitive Deficits through Inhibition of Oxidative and Inflammatory Events,"Soosan Pourmohammadi,Mehrdad Roghani,Zahra Kiasalari,Mohsen Khalili,Soosan Pourmohammadi,Mehrdad Roghani,Zahra Kiasalari,Mohsen Khalili","Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic and inflammatory disorder of the central nervous system with autoimmune nature that is typified by varying degrees of demyelination and axonal damage. Paeonol is an active ingredient in some medicinal plants with anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective property. This study was conducted to reveal whether paeonol can alleviate hippocampal demyelination and cognitive deficits in cuprizone-induced murine model of demyelination as a model of MS. C57BL/6 mice received oral cuprizone (400 mg/kg) for 6 weeks, and paeonol was administered p.o. at two doses of 25 or 100 mg/kg, starting from the second week post-cuprizone for 5 weeks. After assessment of learning and memory in different tasks, oxidative stress and inflammation were evaluated besides immunohistochemical assessment of hippocampal myelin basic protein (MBP). Paeonol (100 mg/kg) properly ameliorated cognitive deficits in Y maze, novel object discrimination (NOD) test, and Barnes maze with no significant improvement of performance in passive avoidance task. In addition, paeonol treatment at the higher dose was also associated with partial restoration of hippocampal level of oxidative stress and inflammatory markers including MDA, ROS, GSH, SOD, catalase, NF-kB, and TNF. Besides, paeonol improved MMP as an index of mitochondrial integrity and health and reduced MPO as a factor of neutrophil infiltration. Furthermore, paeonol treatment prevented hippocampal MBP immunoreactivity, indicating its prevention of demyelination. In conclusion, the current study showed the preventive effect of paeonol against cuprizone-induced demyelination and cognitive deficits through reversing most oxidative stress- and inflammation-related parameters in addition to its improvement of mitochondrial health."
1942,Implementing Circular Economy in municipal solid waste treatment system using P-graph,"Van Fan, Yee; Klemes, Jiri Jaromir; Walmsley, Timothy Gordon; Bertok, Botond","Municipal solid waste (MSW) is one of the issues associated with the growth of economic and urban population. The aim of this study is to develop an integrated design of waste management systems in support of a Circular Economy by P-graph (a bipartite graphical optimisation tool) as an effective decision support tool. The case study considers four MSW compositions based on different country income levels. Solving the P-graph model identifies the most suitable treatment approaches, considering the economic balance between the main operating cost, type, yield, quality of products, as well as the GHG emission (externality cost). The identification of near-optimal solutions by P-graph is useful in dealing with the trade-offs between conflicting objectives, e.g. local policy and practical implementation, that are difficult to monetise. For a lower-income country, the optimal solution includes a combination of at source separation, recycling, incineration (heat, electricity), anaerobic digestion (biofuel, digestate) and the landfill. It avoids an estimated 411 kg CO2eq/t of processed MSW and achieves a potential profit of 42 SIC/t of processed MSW. The optimisation generally favours mechanical biological treatment as the country income level rises, which affects the composition of the MSW. The relative prices of biofuel, electricity and heat (>20%) cause a significant impact on the highest-ranking treatment structure and overall profit. This study shows that the developed framework by P-graph is an effective tool for MSW systems planning. For future study, localised data inputs can be fed into the proposed framework for a customised solution and economic feasibility assessment. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."
1943,Synthesis of silver and copper oxide nanoparticles using Myristica fragrans fruit extract: Antimicrobial and catalytic applications,"Sasidharan, Drishya; Namitha, T. R.; Johnson, Smera P.; Jose, Vimala; Mathew, Paulson","The pericarp of Myristica fragrans fruit extract was utilized for a low cost, eco-friendly synthesis of silver (AgNPs) and copper oxide (CuONPs) nanoparticles. The aqueous fruit extract of the plant was used as reducing and stabilizing agents for this preparation. Characterization of the biosynthesized nanoparticles was carried out using UV -Vis spectroscopy, FTIR spectroscopy and X -Ray Diffraction studies. Morphology and size of the particles was observed using Field -Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy (FESEM) and High Resolution Transmission Elec- tron Microscopy (HRTEM). The copper and silver nanoparticles show Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) band at 360 and 478 nm respectively in the UV -Vis spectrum. It was observed that size of the synthesized copper oxide and silver nanoparticles are in the range 10 -50 nm. The presence of copper and silver elements was confirmed from their respective EDS spectrum. Involvement of phytochemicals in the stabilization and reduction of the nanoparticles was confirmed by FTIR spectroscopy. CuONPs exhibited catalytic activity in 1,3 -dipolar cyclo- addition reaction between azides and terminal alkynes to form 1,2,3-triazoles. Silver nanoparticle possesses good antibacterial activity against multidrug human pathogens Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus subtilis . The present study focuses on the utilization of the less economic part of Myristica fragrans fruit ?s pericarp for the preparation of copper oxide and silver nanoparticles which have good catalytic and antibacterial activities."
1944,Implementation of property-level flood risk adaptation (PLFRA) measures: Choices and decisions,"Attems, Marie-Sophie; Thaler, Thomas; Genovese, Elisabetta; Fuchs, Sven","Hydrometeorological events are highly costly and have strong impacts on the human-environment system. Effective response requires effective risk management concepts and strategies at individual and watershed level to increase community resilience. Focusing on flood risk and the information associated with it, individual risk behavior in the shape of implementing property-level flood risk adaptation (PLFRA) measures is often overlooked. For this research, a comprehensive overview of possible PLFRA measures for homeowners in flood risk areas was made, as well as the possible costs and technical feasibility for new and existing buildings. To complement this, insights into risk mitigation behavior are essential due to the ongoing shift to risk-based and individualized flood risk management, which require a contribution from flood-prone households to risk reduction. Results show that PLFRA measures differentiate in their effectiveness, cost-efficiency and technical feasibility, and full protection can never be guaranteed. Considering risk mitigation behavior, literature generally distinguishes between situational factors (such as communication and economic subsidies) and personal factors (such as personal and psychological components influencing individual behavior)."
1945,"Revisiting the Environmental Kuznets Curve hypothesis in OECD countries: the role of renewable, non-renewable energy, and oil prices","Erdogan, Sinan; Okumus, Ilyas; Guzel, Arif Eser","Environment-economic growth nexus is one of the main concerns of the researchers in the modern era. Although there are several studies in this field, discussions are far from being reached a consensus. The main purpose of this study is to investigate the role of economic growth, renewable and non-renewable energy consumption, oil prices, and trade openness on CO2 emissions in 25 Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries over the period 1990-2014. We provide a comparative panel data evidence using both the first- and second-generation estimation methods. The Fully Modified Ordinary Least Squares (FMOLS) and Dynamic Ordinary Least Squares (DOLS) estimations indicate that the Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) hypothesis is valid in OECD countries. However, the Augmented Mean Group (AMG) estimator revealed that the EKC hypothesis is invalid. The AMG estimator is a second-generation estimator and provides robust results under cross-sectional dependence compared to the first-generation methods; therefore, the EKC hypothesis is invalid. Our additional findings show that rising renewable energy consumption and oil prices mitigate CO2 emissions while non-renewable energy consumption increases it according to all estimators. No significant relationship is found between trade openness and CO2 emissions."
1946,Ferrets are valuable models for SARS-CoV-2 research,"Malgorzata Ciurkiewicz,Federico Armando,Tom Schreiner,Nicole de Buhr,Veronika Pilchová,Vanessa Krupp-Buzimikic,Gülşah Gabriel,Maren von Köckritz-Blickwede,Wolfgang Baumgärtner,Claudia Schulz,Ingo Gerhauser,Malgorzata Ciurkiewicz,Federico Armando,Tom Schreiner,Nicole de Buhr,Veronika Pilchová,Vanessa Krupp-Buzimikic,Gülşah Gabriel,Maren von Köckritz-Blickwede,Wolfgang Baumgärtner,Claudia Schulz,Ingo Gerhauser","Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), resulted in an ongoing pandemic with millions of deaths worldwide. Infection of humans can be asymptomatic or result in fever, fatigue, dry cough, dyspnea, and acute respiratory distress syndrome with multiorgan failure in severe cases. The pathogenesis of COVID-19 is not fully understood, and various models employing different species are currently applied. Ferrets can be infected with SARS-CoV-2 and efficiently transmit the virus to contact animals. In contrast to hamsters, ferrets usually show mild disease and viral replication restricted to the upper airways. Most reports have used the intranasal inoculation route, while the intratracheal infection model is not well characterized. Herein, we present clinical, virological, and pathological data from young ferrets intratracheally inoculated with SARS-CoV-2. Infected animals showed no significant clinical signs, and had transient infection with peak viral RNA loads at 4 days postinfection, mild to moderate rhinitis, and pulmonary endothelialitis/vasculitis. Viral antigen was exclusively found in the respiratory epithelium of the nasal cavity, indicating a particular tropism for cells in this location. Viral antigen was associated with epithelial damage and influx of inflammatory cells, including activated neutrophils releasing neutrophil extracellular traps. Scanning electron microscopy of the nasal respiratory mucosa revealed loss of cilia, shedding, and rupture of epithelial cells. The currently established ferret SARS-CoV-2 infection models are comparatively discussed with SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis in mink, and the advantages and disadvantages of both species as research models for zoonotic betacoronaviruses are highlighted."
1947,Carrier-Free Cross-linked Laccase Crystals for Biocatalytic Degradation of Textile Industrial Effluents,"Sofia Perveen,Sadia Noreen,Salma Shahid,Huma Mehboob,Sadia Aslam,Hafiz M N Iqbal,Muhammad Bilal,Sofia Perveen,Sadia Noreen,Salma Shahid,Huma Mehboob,Sadia Aslam,Hafiz M N Iqbal,Muhammad Bilal","Herein, laccase from Trametes versicolor was used to fabricate carrier-free cross-linked laccase crystals (CLLCs) and deployed as a robust catalyst for waste effluent treatment. The surface morphology and involvement of functional group attributes of CLLCs were scrutinized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). As fabricated CLLCs were subjected to kinetic characterization by assessing the effects of pH environment, thermal profile, and substrate (determination of Km and Vmax) on the activity. A fully characterized CLLCs fraction was used to treat synthetic dyes containing waste effluents taken from various industries, i.e., Chenab Textile Industry, M-tax, Sitara, and National Silk & Rayon Mills. Degradation profile revealed 36.8%, 27.6%, 39.9%, and 26.4% degradation of Chenab Textile Industry, M-tax, Sitara, and National Silk & Rayon Mills, respectively, by the free form of laccase, whereas the biocatalytic activity of CCLCs led to 78.6%, 75.6%, 85.5%, and 63.3% degradation of those effluents. The decrease in peak and mass region alongside the presence of new peaks in GC-MS affirms the effective decolorization of contaminated waste effluents. CLLCs retained over 70% and 50% of their degradation activity after 3 and 5 cycles, respectively. In conclusion, CLLCs might represent a robust bioprocess to improve the usability of laccase for various synthetic dyes containing waste effluents to diminish environmental pollution from the dye-based industries."
1948,Multi-objective performance of smart hybrid energy system with Multi-optimal participation of customers in day-ahead energy market,"Chamandoust, Heydar; Derakhshan, Ghasem; Bahramara, Salah","Optimal energy consumption is one of the sustainable development issues in many countries to improve the economic and environmental indices in the energy sector. This paper presents a tri-objective optimal performance of a smart hybrid energy system (SHES) in the presence of customer's participation to optimally reshape the demand profile in the day-ahead energy market. Minimizing the operation costs and the emission pollution as well as maximizing the customer satisfaction level are considered as the objectives of this problem. The three types of demand response (DR) programs consisting of 1) demand curtailment, 2) demand shifting and 3) onsite generation program are considered for optimal scheduling of the electrical and the thermal energy consumption by the customers. The demand curtailment program is considered as the reserve for SHES and the Plug Electric Vehicles (PEVs) are taken into account as the onsite generation program. The uncertainties of energy and reserve prices are modeled using lognormal distribution function. The shuffled frog leaping algorithm (SFLA) is employed to solve the problem from which the non-dominated solutions are generated. Then, the best solution of the non-dominated solutions is selected by the hybrid approach of fuzzy method and the weight sum. To validate the mentioned approach, five case studies are investigated and the results demonstrate optimal scheduling of SHES with acceptable levels of operation costs, emission pollution and customer satisfaction.

A mathematical model implemented in MATLAB software is developed to simulate the proposed SDS system operation in order to analyze its performance, under conditions of Tianjin, China. An analysis of the daily, monthly, and annual performances of the investigated SDS system is performed. In addition, a techno-economic viability for assessing the electricity cost and life cycle cost of the SDS system is also performed. The results indicated that the proposed SDS system produces 28.748 MWh annually, with a yearly net overall efficiency of 19.55%, and achieves maximum energy of 3.8 MWh with a monthly average efficiency of 22.75% in June. From the energy cost analysis, the levelized energy cost of the SDS system is estimated to be 1.719 CNY/kWh similar to (0.2565 $/kWh). In conclusion, the present study identifies the actual commercial and economic situation of the Dish Stirling technology in China, taking into account the China's feed-in tariff of CSP systems (1.2 CNY/kWh), and it also provides a new theoretical guidance for predicting the annual performance and evaluating the economic situation of the SDS systems."
1950,Sustainability Driven by Agriculture through Digital Transformation,"Hrustek, Larisa","Economic, environmental and social sustainability is increasingly gaining the attention of academia and commitment in the policies of national economies. Global warming and climate change, weather disasters and disruptions are just some of the challenges that can drastically disrupt stable business models, and thus jeopardize sustainability. Agriculture, as an activity at the center of the value chain, is facing these problems, and, at the same time, contributes to feeding the growing world population and is responsible for conserving resources and ensuring sustainability. Process automation, data analysis and processing, control and management of agricultural operations have transformed the agricultural business and contributed to sustainability, survival and development within supply chains. This article analyzes the literature in the field of sustainability and agriculture led by digital technologies of Industry 4.0. The analysis of the research field showed the high importance of the topic in academic and national circles, given the number of published articles. Secondly, the concepts of sustainable agriculture and sustainability driven agriculture in the context of digital transformation were analyzed and it was shown that transformed agriculture can successfully cope with today's challenges. Finally, guidelines for sustainable development driven by agriculture through the determinants of digital transformation are defined."
1951,The role of environmental entrepreneurship for sustainable development: Evidence from 35 countries in Sub-Saharan Africa,"Sun, Huaping; Pofoura, Aminatou Kemajou; Mensah, Isaac Adjei; Li, Liang; Mohsin, Muhammad","This research seeks to confirm the achievement of sustainable development in Sub-Sahara Africa. In view of this, a panel of 35 Sub-Saharan Africa countries divided into two sub-panels based on their income groupings, namely low-income, and middle-income countries, from 2000 to 2014 with a cross-sectional dependence among the series was used as a prerequisite for the analysis. We used the Pooled Mean Group estimators of the Autoregressive Distributed Lag model to ascertain the long-run mechanism between variables and analyse the Environmental Kuznets Curve hypothesis. The key results are: (1) income per capita significantly increases environmental pollution where environmental entrepreneurship decreases pollution of the environment across all panels of SSA countries; (2) in the low-income SSA economies, trade openness enhance environmental quality but increase environmental pollution in both the aggregated panel and middle-income SSA nations; (3) with the exception of low-income countries, human development palpably decreases environmental pollution in middle-income countries and in the aggregated panel a reduction is observed; (4) from financial development perspective, it produces positive and significant effect in the aggregated panel of SSA countries and middle-income SSA nations; (5) the environmental Kuznets curve conjuncture is supported for the selected panels in SSA region. Consequently, governments and policymakers should reinforce policies for the reduction of environmental pollution, more importantly, green financing policies, encourage aspiring environmental entrepreneurs to set environmentally-driven businesses, promote the use of environmental products to mitigate environmental problems and achieve sustainable development.

1952,Cost-benefit analysis of waste photovoltaic module recycling in China,"Liu, Caijie; Zhang, Qin; Wang, Hai","With the rapid development of renewable energy, the impact on environment and resource caused by waste photovoltaic modules has been realized gradually. To solve the problem, recycling becomes an effectual way. Therefore, the aim of this paper was to assess the economic feasibility of the photovoltaic modules recycling project in China by using cost-benefit analysis. It was found that, under the estimated treatment quantity will generate in China in 2020-2034, the recovery cost per kilowatt (kW) of photovoltaic modules will be 25.11 USD, the unit benefit is 25.68 USD/kW, and the unit net benefit is 0.57 USD/kW. The net present value (NPV) and benefit-cost ratio (BCR) are 21.14 million USD and 1.023. The sensitivity analysis indicated that the sale benefits of recycled materials and tax were the most sensitive factors affecting the project's economy.

We investigated the effects of exposure to prenatal depression on white matter microstructural integrity at birth and at 2-3 years, and associated neurodevelopment. Diffusion-weighted images were acquired for children of the Drakenstein Child Health Study at 2-4 weeks postpartum (n=70, 47% boys) and at 2-3 years of age (n=60, 58% boys). Tract-Based Spatial Statistics was used to compare, using an ROI based approach, diffusion tensor metrics across groups defined by presence (>19 on Beck's Depression Inventory and/or >12 on the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale) or absence (below depression thresholds) of depression, and associations with neurodevelopmental measures at age 2-3 years were determined. We did not detect group differences in white matter integrity at neonatal age, but at 2-3 years, children in the exposed group demonstrated higher fractional anisotropy, and lower mean and radial diffusivity in association tracts compared to controls. This was notable in the sagittal stratum (radial diffusivity: p<0.01). Altered white matter integrity metrics were also observed in projection tracts, including the corona radiata, which associated with cognitive and motor outcomes in exposed 2-3-year-olds (p<0.05). Our findings of widespread white matter alterations in 2-3-year-old children with prenatal exposure to depression are consistent with previous findings, as well as with neuroimaging findings in adults with major depression. Further, we identified novel associations of altered white matter integrity with cognitive development in depression-exposed children, suggesting that these neuroimaging findings may have early functional impact."
1955,Multilevel monte carlo for cortical circuit models,"Zhuo-Cheng Xiao,Kevin K Lin,Zhuo-Cheng Xiao,Kevin K Lin","Multilevel Monte Carlo (MLMC) methods aim to speed up computation of statistics from dynamical simulations. MLMC is easy to implement and is sometimes very effective, but its efficacy may depend on the underlying dynamics. We apply MLMC to networks of spiking neurons and assess its effectiveness on prototypical models of cortical circuitry under different conditions. We find that MLMC can be very efficient for computing reliable features, i.e., features of network dynamics that are reproducible upon repeated presentation of the same external forcing. In contrast, MLMC is less effective for complex, internally generated activity. Qualitative explanations are given using concepts from random dynamical systems theory."
1956,Study on properties of phase change foam concrete block mixed with paraffin / fumed silica composite phase change material,"Qu, Yue; Chen, Jiayu; Liu, Lifang; Xu, Tao; Wu, Huijun; Zhou, Xiaoqing","On-site renewable energy generation systems are installed for buildings to compensate for their energy consumptions due to cooling and heating loads. Fluctuated energy load can significantly affect the decision on the selection of renewable energy systems. This study developed a new phase change foam concrete with low thermal conductivity and suitable phase change temperature to shave the temperature peak in summer and improve the economic feasibility of renewable energy systems. With the adsorption method, this study utilized the fumed silica to absorb paraffin for the composite phase change materials (PCM) formation. Through morphology and liquid leakage tests, this study found that the composite PCM with paraffin content of 45% (wt) had the best adsorption capacity and setting performance. According to the scanning electron microscopy (SEM), metallographic microscopy and X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) tests, the proposed composite PCM and phase change foam concrete blocks have stable morphological structures and physical properties. Also, the differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) showed the proposed composite PCM within the concrete have suitable phase change temperature (about 41 degrees C) and phase change latent heat (the endothermic process is 113.3 J/g and the exothermic process is 112 J/g to avoid building overheating in summer. Finally, the thermal conductivity and heating experiments suggested the proposed phase change foam concrete blocks have low thermal conductivity and strong heat storage capacity.

1957,Improving pesticide fate models for a simple household food processing: considering multiple crop units,"Zijian Li,Zijian Li","To understand the fate of pesticides in crops during household cooking processes and human health risks associated with the ingestion of pesticide-contaminated crops, we propose unit-variability-enhanced models, which are capable of evaluating the removal efficiency of pesticides in multiple crop units by soaking in water. The approach integrates the lognormal production model to reveal the modeling mechanics of internal contamination among two crop units in one soaking bowl. The simulated results for 197 pesticides indicate that pesticides with larger unit-to-unit variability factors (VF) at the residue levels and diffusivity rates in water (DW) are more likely to cause internal contamination. Although internal contamination of pesticide residues between two crop units may occur, we find that the overall removal factor ([Formula: see text]) for two crop units is independent of the ratio of initial residue levels between the two crop units. Based on this discovery, we propose the unit-variability-based (UVB) rule to generalize the [Formula: see text] for an n-crop-unit system, where n crop units soak simultaneously in one container. In addition, we demonstrate that under the same consumable and recycling resources, the soaking of two crop units together in one container can yield a maximum mass removal of pesticides if the two units are randomly sampled. Although other factors, such as temperature and the nature of solutions in the cooking process, should be considered in future studies, our models suggest that this soaking method can be conveniently realized in households to reduce negative health effects."
1958,Hybrid decision tree-based machine learning models for short-term water quality prediction,"Lu, Hongfang; Ma, Xin","Water resources are the foundation of people's life and economic development, and are closely related to health and the environment. Accurate prediction of water quality is the key to improving water management and pollution control. In this paper, two novel hybrid decision tree-based machine learning models are proposed to obtain more accurate short-term water quality prediction results. The basic models of the two hybrid models are extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) and random forest (RF), which respectively introduce an advanced data denoising technique - complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise (CEEMDAN). Taking the water resources of Gales Creek site in Tualatin River (one of the most polluted rivers in the world) Basin as an example, a total of 1875 data (hourly data) from May 1, 2019 to July 20, 2019 are collected. Two hybrid models are used to predict six water quality indicators, including water temperature, dissolved oxygen, pH value, specific conductance, turbidity, and fluorescent dissolved organic matter. Six error metrics are introduced as the basis of performance evaluation, and the results of the two models are compared with the other four conventional models. The results reveal that: (1) CEEMDAN-RF performs best in the prediction of temperature, dissolved oxygen and specific conductance, the mean absolute percentage errors (MAPEs) are 0.69%, 1.05%, and 0.90%, respectively. CEEMDAN-XGBoost performs best in the prediction of pH value, turbidity, and fluorescent dissolved organic matter, the MAPEs are 0.27%, 14.94%, and 1.59%, respectively. (2) The average MAPEs of CEEMDAN-RF and CEEMMDAN-XGBoost models are the smallest, which are 3.90% and 3.71% respectively, indicating that their overall prediction performance is the best. In addition, the stability of the prediction model is also discussed in this paper. The analysis shows that the prediction stability of CEEMDAN-RF and CEEMDAN-XGBoost is higher than other benchmark models. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."

In this paper, we use the super efficiency Slack-Based Measure model (super-efficiency SBM model) to measure the energy efficiency of 30 provinces in China, and then conduct Empirical Orthogonal Function (EOF) to analyze its spatial-temporal evolution. Moreover, we use the Geographically and Temporally Weighted Regression (GTWR) to analyze the spatial-temporal heterogeneity of its driving factors. The results showthat: (i) during the sample period, China's energy efficiency shows a rapidly upward trend, accompanied by the gradually strengthening spatial pattern of the ""eastern>central>western""; (ii) the spatial pattern of the ""southern>northern"" exhibited by the annual growth rate of energy efficiency experienced a process of weakening first and then gradually strengthening; (iii) the influencing effects of market openness, relative energy price and industry structure on energy efficiency have no significant heterogeneity as a whole; (iv) the effects of environmental regulation intensity, the marketization level, the technical level, energy consumption structure and economic development level have significant spatial heterogeneity, and the effects of energy conservation and emission reduction policies has significant temporal heterogeneity.

1960,Life cycle assessment and techno-economic analysis of biomass-to-hydrogen production with methane tri-reforming,"Li, Guoxuan; Wang, Shuai; Zhao, Jiangang; Qi, Huaqing; Ma, Zhaoyuan; Cui, Peizhe; Zhu, Zhaoyou; Gao, Jun; Wang, Yinglong","In this study, the techno-economic, energy consumption (EC), and environmental performances of biomass-to-hydrogen (BTH) production with/without methane tri-reforming (MTR) from corn straw were studied. The techno-economic analysis includes an assessment of the energy efficiency, MTR operating conditions, total capital investment (TCI), production cost (PC), and payback period. The BTH energy efficiency with MTR is 17.08% higher than that without MTR. The Claus unit is the largest contribution unit of energy loss. The reaction temperature and operating pressure of one MTR unit are 800 degrees C and 0.1 MPa, respectively. Compared with BTH without MTR, the TCI of BTH with MTR increased by 10.97%, and the PC decreased by 10.12%. The static payback period of BTH with MTR is approximately 4.72 yr. BTH without MTR exhibits 3.09% less EC and 7.85% greenhouse gas emissions than that of BTH with MTR. The life cycle analysis of the BTH process illustrates that the BTH with MTR can realize negative carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions when considering the natural carbon cycle. The evaluation method combines a thermodynamic analysis with a life cycle assessment, which is significant for the development of clean hydrogen production technology with low carbon and high energy savings.

1961,Industrial demand-side flexibility: A key element of a just energy transition and industrial development,"Heffron, Raphael; Koerner, Marc-Fabian; Wagner, Jonathan; Weibelzahl, Martin; Fridgen, Gilbert","In many countries, industry is one of the largest consumers of electricity. Given the special importance of electricity for industry, a reliable electricity supply is a basic prerequisite for further industrial development and associated economic growth. As countries worldwide transition to a low-carbon economy (in particular, by the development of renewable energy sources), the increasing fluctuation in renewable energy production requires new flexibility options within the electricity system in order to guarantee security of supply. It is advanced in this paper that such a flexibility transition with an active participation of industry in general has unique potential: It will not only promote green industrial development, but also become an engine for inclusive industrial development and growth as well as delivering a just transition to a low-carbon economy. Given the high potential of industrial demand-side flexibility, a first monitoring approach for such a flexibility transition is illustrated, which bases on a flexibility index. Our flexibility index allows for an indication of mis-developments and supports an appropriate implementation of countermeasures together with relevant stakeholders. Hence, it holds various insights for both policy-makers and practice with respect to how industrial demand-side flexibility can ensure advances towards an inclusive, just, and sustainable industrial development."
1962,"Digital Business Model, Digital Transformation, Digital Entrepreneurship: Is There A Sustainable ""Digital""?","Bican, Peter M.; Brem, Alexander","Digitalization plays a major role in contributing towards the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. Without transformation of existing businesses, both economic and environmental challenges of the future cannot be solved sustainably. However, there is much confusion on interrelationships and terms dealing with digitization or digitalization: Digital business model, digital transformation, digital entrepreneurship. How do these terms interrelate with and to digitalization, and how do they support firms to grow sustainably? To answer this question, we identified seven core digital-related terms based on a structured literature search within the management and economics domain, namely: Digital, Business Model, Digital Business Model, Digital Technology, Digital Innovation, Digital Transformation, and Digital Entrepreneurship. Thereafter, we analyzed prior literature for deriving a common understanding and definition as a basis for interrelations within a conceptual framework. Definitions were presented in a case study setup with twelve innovation and research and development (R&D) managers from various business units of a German high-tech company. Based on these insights, we propose a conceptual framework on how Digital Readiness, Digital Technology, and Digital Business Models might sustainably relate to Innovation, moderated by a Digital Transformation Process. With this approach, we aim to equip practitioners and researchers alike in handling and addressing change through digitalization sustainably."
1963,"Balloons, tails and bubbles: depicting speech and thought out of the brain and into the clinic","Geoffrey D Schott,Geoffrey D Schott","Illustrations of the internal workings of the brain often depict arrows. In contrast, many illustrations which depict the link between certain brain functions and the outside world harness a graphic technique more usually associated with forms of popular culture such as comics. This technique comprises a balloon containing an image or message linked either by a tail emanating from the mouth when representing speech, or by a stream of bubbles emanating from the head when representing thought. Although a pictorial speech device first appeared over two millennia ago, balloons with their linkages now have various important practical clinical applications, notably in autism spectrum disorders, profound deafness in children without neurocognitive impairment, and sexual health education."
1964,Successional adaptive strategies revealed by correlating arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal abundance with host plant gene expression,"Cheng Gao,Pierre-Emmanuel Courty,Nelle Varoquaux,Benjamin Cole,Liliam Montoya,Ling Xu,Elizabeth Purdom,John Vogel,Robert B Hutmacher,Jeffery A Dahlberg,Devin Coleman-Derr,Peggy G Lemaux,John W Taylor,Cheng Gao,Pierre-Emmanuel Courty,Nelle Varoquaux,Benjamin Cole,Liliam Montoya,Ling Xu,Elizabeth Purdom,John Vogel,Robert B Hutmacher,Jeffery A Dahlberg,Devin Coleman-Derr,Peggy G Lemaux,John W Taylor","The shifts in adaptive strategies revealed by ecological succession and the mechanisms that facilitate these shifts are fundamental to ecology. These adaptive strategies could be particularly important in communities of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) mutualistic with sorghum, where strong AMF succession replaces initially ruderal species with competitive ones and where the strongest plant response to drought is to manage these AMF. Although most studies of agriculturally important fungi focus on parasites, the mutualistic symbionts, AMF, constitute a research system of human-associated fungi whose relative simplicity and synchrony are conducive to experimental ecology. First, we hypothesize that, when irrigation is stopped to mimic drought, competitive AMF species should be replaced by AMF species tolerant to drought stress. We then, for the first time, correlate AMF abundance and host plant transcription to test two novel hypotheses about the mechanisms behind the shift from ruderal to competitive AMF. Surprisingly, despite imposing drought stress, we found no stress-tolerant AMF, probably due to our agricultural system having been irrigated for nearly six decades. Remarkably, we found strong and differential correlation between the successional shift from ruderal to competitive AMF and sorghum genes whose products (i) produce and release strigolactone signals, (ii) perceive mycorrhizal-lipochitinoligosaccharide (Myc-LCO) signals, (iii) provide plant lipid and sugar to AMF, and (iv) import minerals and water provided by AMF. These novel insights frame new hypotheses about AMF adaptive evolution and suggest a rationale for selecting AMF to reduce inputs and maximize yields in commercial agriculture."
1965,"Levelised cost of energy, A challenge for offshore wind","Johnston, Barry; Foley, Aoife; Doran, John; Littler, Timothy","Long-term economic viability of offshore wind power is not only reliant on reducing installation, commissioning, and operations and maintenance costs, but also on the elimination of subsidies and grants. Current economic analyses use historical price and cost data to predict the levelised cost, net present value, payback period and internal rate of return from offshore wind. These analyses use parameters such as water depth at site, number and size of turbines, grid connection costs, equipment costs, revenue from the wholesale market price of electricity, operations and maintenance costs, revenue from subsidies and the cost of finance amongst others to build a model to determine the viability of the array. Here we review the challenges of accurately estimating levelised cost of energy (LCOE) for offshore wind outlining differing approaches to calculating LCOE, the factors influencing this, and the impact of variation in LCOE calculation. Current costs for the production of offshore wind energy are summarised based on publicly available datasets. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."
1966,Dynamic relationship among agriculture-energy-forestry and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions: empirical evidence from China,"Chandio, Abbas Ali; Akram, Waqar; Ahmad, Fayyaz; Ahmad, Munir","This study aims to explore the dynamic association among crop production, livestock production, power consumption in agriculture, forest area, and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. Based on the annual data of China, spanning the period 1990 to 2016, the study applied the auto-regressive distributed lag (ARDL) bounds testing approach. In addition, the fully modified ordinary least squares (FMOLS) canonical cointegration regression (CCR) and the Granger causality tests are employed to check the robustness of the ARDL estimations. The ARDL-bounds testing approach indicated that all variables share a long-run connection. The long- and short-run ARDL estimations confirmed that crop production, as well as livestock production, has a significant positive effect on CO(2)emissions in both cases. However, power consumption in agriculture and forest area has a negative effect on it, indicating that both variables reduce CO(2)emissions in the long and short run. These results stood robust under various regression estimators and confirmed the findings of the ARDL method. Additionally, the results of the causality approach specified that a unidirectional causality is running from crop production, power consumption in agriculture, and forest area to CO(2)emissions. The causality between livestock production and CO(2)emissions is bidirectional. Therefore, the directions of this connection also validate the outcomes under various techniques used for robustness. These findings suggest that the government must reconsider its policies related to agricultural and livestock production and adopt environment-friendly practices in the agriculture sector that may reduce the carbon footprints in the long run."
1967,Establishment of geochemical thresholds for vanadium throughout Korea and at potential development sites using geochemical map data,"Joo Sung Ahn,Seung-Jun Youm,Yong-Chan Cho,Gil-Jae Yim,Sang-Woo Ji,Joo Sung Ahn,Seung-Jun Youm,Yong-Chan Cho,Gil-Jae Yim,Sang-Woo Ji","Geochemical maps can be used for a variety of purposes, one of which is to establish regional or local geochemical thresholds for the analyzed elements. In the case of vanadium, as industrial demand and use increase, it is necessary to expand the development of vanadium in Korea. However, the environmental management standards are insufficient. Therefore, in this study, using geochemical data, we derived geochemical threshold values for the entire country and areas with potential for the development of vanadium deposits. The regional (country-wide) threshold value was derived using logarithmic transformation of raw data (N = 23,548) of the first- and second-order stream sediments collected across the country in the late 1990s and the early 2000s. The median + 2 median absolute deviation (MAD) and Tukey inner fence (TIF) values were 116 mg/kg and 200 mg/kg, respectively. Of these, the TIF standard, which showed 0.6% of data exceeding the threshold, was judged to be appropriate for distinguishing clear enrichment or contamination of vanadium. In the case of the Geumsan and Pocheon, areas with potential for vanadium development, the TIF and median + 2 MAD values of 259 mg/kg and 218 mg/kg, respectively, can be used as the criteria for evaluating the impact of environmental pollution before and after deposit development. Likewise, by deriving threshold values of the target elements using geochemical map data, it is possible to provide basic environmental information for geochemical evaluation and follow-up management in advance during large-scale site development."
1968,Aligned and Divergent Perceptions of Support Persons' Role in Triadic Gynecologic Cancer Communication,"Lauren E Lee,Kathryn Greene,Maria K Venetis,Allyson C Bontempo,Danielle Catona,Alexandre Buckley de Meritens,Katie A Devine,Lauren E Lee,Kathryn Greene,Maria K Venetis,Allyson C Bontempo,Danielle Catona,Alexandre Buckley de Meritens,Katie A Devine","Health care providers routinely advise cancer patients to involve support persons in oncology care to fulfill critical support roles. This qualitative descriptive study explored alignment of triadic perceptions of support person involvement in oncology treatment visits and cancer-related care from the perspectives of patients with gynecologic cancer (n = 18), regular visit-attending support people (n = 16), and health care providers (n = 10), including oncologists, nurses, and medical assistants. Semi-structured interviews (N = 44) captured perceptions of facilitation and interference of support persons' roles within and outside appointments with oncology providers. Thematic analyses revealed alignment and divergence regarding support persons' instrumental, informational, and emotional support behaviors. Perspectives aligned regarding what support functions companions provide. However, patients and support persons emphasized the significance of instrumental followed by informational and emotional support, whereas oncology providers highlighted informational, followed by emotional and instrumental support. Discussion provides insight into each role's perspective in the triad."
1969,Use of carbide slag from acetylene industry for activation of ground granulated blast-furnace slag,"Li, Wentao; Yi, Yaolin","This study investigates the use of carbide slag (CS), an industrial by-product generated in acetylene production, as a potential alternative to hydrated lime (HL) for activation of ground granulated blast-furnace slag (GGBS), another industrial by-product generated during the process of iron production. Specimens of CS-GGBS and HL-GGBS pastes with different CS or HL contents were prepared and cured for different periods, and then tested for compressive strength. X-ray diffraction (XRD), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) were also used to investigate the hydration characteristics of CS-GGBS. The results indicated that CS-GGBS yielded similar compressive strength as HL-GGBS with the same CS/HL content at the same curing periods of 28 and 56 days, i.e. CS could replace HL to activate GGBS, which would result in both environmental and economic benefits. The Ca(OH)(2) in CS accelerated the hydration of GGBS, and hence more hydration products were produced. However, excessive CS addition would decrease the GGBS content and increase crystal calcium hydroxide in the matrix, causing strength decrease. Hence, there was an optimum CS/HL content to achieve the highest compressive strength, which was 10% for 7 days and 5% for 28 and 56 days. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."
1970,Artificial intelligence approaches to the determinants of women's vaginal dryness using general hospital data,"Ki-Jin Ryu,Kyong Wook Yi,Yong Jin Kim,Jung Ho Shin,Jun Young Hur,Tak Kim,Jong Bae Seo,Kwang-Sig Lee,Hyuntae Park,Ki-Jin Ryu,Kyong Wook Yi,Yong Jin Kim,Jung Ho Shin,Jun Young Hur,Tak Kim,Jong Bae Seo,Kwang-Sig Lee,Hyuntae Park","The aim of this study is to analyse the determinants of women's vaginal dryness using machine learning. Data came from Korea University Anam Hospital in Seoul, Republic of Korea, with 3298 women, aged 40-80 years, who attended their general health check from January 2010 to December 2012. Five machine learning methods were applied and compared for the prediction of vaginal dryness, measured by a Menopause Rating Scale. Random forest variable importance, a performance gap between a complete model and a model excluding a certain variable, was adopted for identifying major determinants of vaginal dryness. In terms of the mean squared error, the random forest (1.0597) was much better than linear regression (17.9043) and artificial neural networks with one, two and three hidden layers (1.7452, 1.7148 and 1.7736, respectively). Based on random forest variable importance, the top-10 determinants of vaginal dryness were menopause age, age, menopause, height, thyroid stimulating hormone, neutrophils, years since menopause, lymphocytes, alkaline phosphatase and blood urea nitrogen. In addition, its top-20 determinants were peak expiratory flow rate, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, white blood cells, monocytes, cancer antigen 19-9, creatinine, eosinophils, total cholesterol, triglyceride and amylase. Machine learning presents a great decision support system for the prediction of vaginal dryness. For preventing vaginal dryness, preventive measures would be needed regarding early menopause, the thyroid function and systematic inflammation.Impact StatementWhat is already known on this subject? Only a few studies have investigated the risk factors of vaginal dryness in middle-aged women. More research is to be done for finding its various risk factors, identifying its major risk groups and drawing its effective clinical implications.What do the results of this study add? This study is the first machine-learning study to predict women's vaginal dryness and analyse their determinants. The random forest could discuss which factors are more important for the prediction of vaginal dryness. Based on random forest variable importance, menopause age was the most important determinant of vaginal dryness and their association was discovered to be negative in this study. Vaginal dryness was closely associated with the height, rather than the body weight or body mass index. The importance rankings of blood conditions related to systematic inflammation were within the top-20 in this study: neutrophils, lymphocytes, white blood cells, monocytes and eosinophils.What are the implications of these findings for clinical practice and/or further research? Machine learning presents a great decision support system for the prediction of vaginal dryness. For preventing vaginal dryness, preventive measures would be needed regarding early menopause and systematic inflammation."
1971,Clinical applications of point-of-care ultrasound in brain injury: a narrative review,"M Dinsmore,L Venkatraghavan,M Dinsmore,L Venkatraghavan","The use of point-of-care ultrasound has increased considerably over the last two decades. It has become a readily available, non-invasive bed-side modality for the rapid diagnosis and management of patients in various settings. Point-of-care ultrasound for assessing the heart, lung, abdomen, airway and vascular systems is now well established. Transcranial Doppler ultrasound for assessing cerebral blood flow has been in use for many years. In recent years, brain ultrasonography has been shown to be a powerful tool in the rapid bed-side assessment of cerebral haemodynamics and structural pathology. Brain ultrasound has been shown to be useful in both the emergency department and neurocritical care setting for the non-invasive assessment of raised intracranial pressure, cerebral autoregulation and diagnosis of intracranial haematoma and other space-occupying lesions. Point-of-care ultrasound is an important alternative technique to routine imaging and invasive monitoring techniques, and results are comparable. Competence is easily attainable without formal radiology training. With technological advancement, applications for the use of brain ultrasound continue to grow. This review discusses the clinical use of point-of-care ultrasound in the diagnosis and management of brain injury."
1972,School-related Promotive Factors Related to Cannabis Use Among American Indian Adolescents,"Kimberly L Henry,Meghan A Crabtree,Randall C Swaim,Linda R Stanley,Kimberly L Henry,Meghan A Crabtree,Randall C Swaim,Linda R Stanley","Reservation-dwelling American Indian adolescents are at exceedingly high risk for cannabis use. Prevention initiatives to delay onset and escalation of use are needed. School engagement and student's positive experiences at school have been identified as key promotive factors against cannabis use in the general population of adolescents, but little work has examined these factors among American Indian youth. Seven school-related promotive factors were examined as predictors of past 30-day cannabis use (measured 6 months later), controlling for previous onset of cannabis use as well as a set of relevant potential confounders. Models were tested using 280 adolescents in 6th or 7th grade at the start of the study from two reservation-based schools in the US. Students were surveyed three times, with 6 months in between each survey. The average age at the start of the study was 11.99 years (SD = 0.87) and 54% of participants were female. Using a cumulative logit model to predict past 30-day use, American Indian youth who reported greater school bonding, academic aspirations, proclivity to endeavor in their studies, and interest in school at Wave 2 reported less 30-day cannabis use at Wave 3 (controlling for onset of cannabis at Wave 1 and several other control variables). No evidence of an effect of self-reported grades, perceived safety, or participation in school-related extracurricular activities was found. Given substantial deterioration of these school-related promotive factors over time, and the effect of the school-related promotive factors on subsequent cannabis use, efforts to design and test interventions to promote school engagement as a protective measure against cannabis use is warranted."
1973,Named entity disambiguation in short texts over knowledge graphs,"Wissem Bouarroudj,Zizette Boufaida,Ladjel Bellatreche,Wissem Bouarroudj,Zizette Boufaida,Ladjel Bellatreche","The ever-growing usage of knowledge graphs (KGs) positions named entity disambiguation (NED) at the heart of designing accurate KG-driven systems such as query answering systems (QAS). According to the current research, most studies dealing with NED on KGs involve long texts, which is not the case of short text fragments, identified by their limited contexts. The accuracy of QASs strongly depends on the management of such short text. This limitation motivates this paper, which studies the NED problem on KGs, involving only short texts. First, we propose a NED approach including the following steps: (i) context expansion using WordNet to measure its similarity to the resource context. (ii) Exploiting coherence between entities in queries that contain more than one entity, such as ""Is Michelle Obama the wife of Barack Obama?"". (iii) Taking into account the relations between words to calculate their similarity with the properties of a resource. (iv) the use of syntactic features. The NED solution approach is compared to state-of-the-art approaches using five datasets. The experimental results show that our approach outperforms these systems by 27% in the F-measure. A system called Welink, implementing our proposal, is available on GitHub, and it is also accessible via a REST API."
1974,Gamification in software engineering: the mediating role of developer engagement and job satisfaction,"Klaas-Jan Stol,Mario Schaarschmidt,Shelly Goldblit,Klaas-Jan Stol,Mario Schaarschmidt,Shelly Goldblit","Gamification seeks to encourage behavior of participants by borrowing elements of games, such as scoring points. Few rigorous studies exist of gamification in software organizations, and several questions have remained unanswered, for example, what might drive developers to partake, and what are the consequences of developer engagement. This article seeks to provide some answers through a rigorous empirical study at one organization that created an internal gamification platform. We develop a theoretical model that seeks to explain why developers may participate, and develop the concept of developer engagement, which we link to job satisfaction. We collected data from two sources that were linked together: developer opinion data collected through a survey, and data from the organization's version control system. We test our theoretical model using structural equation modeling and moderation analysis, and find support for our model. These findings suggest that gamification can be an effective mechanism to engage developers within the organization, and that developer engagement is positively associated with job satisfaction, which is a key outcome that is of great interest to software organizations."
1975,Temperature is not a major factor in the differentiation of gonocytes into ad spermatogonia and fertility outcome in congenitally cryptorchid boys,"Faruk Hadziselimovic,Faruk Hadziselimovic","Spermatogenesis in mammals is a heat-sensitive developmental pathway incompatible with the typical mammalian body temperature of 37 °C. It is thought that this is the reason why the testicles of most mammalian males are outside of the body cavity, in the scrotum, where they function at approximately 33 °C. It has been suggested that the abnormally high temperature environment of cryptorchid testes may lead to impaired testicular development and adult infertility. Here, I summarize the clinical, genetic, and histological evidence that argues against temperature stress and in favor of hypogonadotropic hypogonadism as the underlying cause of adult infertility in cryptorchidism.Patient summary: Infertility and an increased risk of testicular cancer in patients diagnosed with undescended testes are the consequence of a hormonal deficiency rather than temperature-induced cellular damage. Cryptorchidism therefore requires both surgical and hormonal treatment."
1976,Kidney and Mortality Outcomes Associated with Ondansetron in Critically Ill Patients,"Matthew Gray,Priyanka Priyanka,Sandra Kane-Gill,Lirong Wang,John A Kellum,Matthew Gray,Priyanka Priyanka,Sandra Kane-Gill,Lirong Wang,John A Kellum","Background: Ondansetron is a preferred anti-emetic in critical care to treat nausea and vomiting, and has historically been considered a largely safe option. A recent pharmacoepidemiology study reported that ondansetron may be associated with an increased risk for acute kidney injury (AKI). Methods: We interrogated the High-Density Intensive Care (HiDenIC-15) database containing intensive care data for 13 hospitals across Western Pennsylvania between Oct 2008-Dec 2014. AKI was defined using the Kidney Disease, Improving Global Outcomes 2012 guidelines. Ondansetron use was considered as receiving any form of ondansetron within 24 h of admission. The subsequent 48 h (hours 25-72 after admission) were analyzed for outcomes. Primary outcome was development of AKI; secondary outcomes included 90-day mortality and time to AKI. Propensity-matched, multivariate logistic regression was applied for both outcomes. Comparator groups were metoclopramide and prochlorperazine using the same exposure criteria. Results:AKI occurred in 965 (5.6%), 12 (3.0%), and 61 (6.5%) patients receiving ondansetron, prochlorperazine, and metoclopramide, respectively. In the adjusted analysis, no anti-emetic was associated with a significant change in the odds of developing AKI. Ondansetron was associated with a 5.48% decrease (CI -6.17--4.79) in death within 90 days of ICU-admission, which was independent of AKI status; an effect not seen with other anti-emetics. Anti-emetic usage was not associated with a change in the time to first AKI. Conclusion:Anti-emetic usage did not alter AKI risk. Ondansetron was associated with a significant decrease in 90-day mortality that was not seen by other anti-emetics, which requires further exploration."
1977,"Stress, Resilience, and Well-Being in Italian Children and Their Parents during the COVID-19 Pandemic","Cusinato, Maria; Iannattone, Sara; Spoto, Andrea; Poli, Mikael; Moretti, Carlo; Gatta, Michela; Miscioscia, Marina","The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak has forced parents and children to adopt significant changes in their daily routine, which has been a big challenge for families, with important implications for family stress. In this study, we aimed to analyze the potential risk and protective factors for parents' and children's well-being during a potentially traumatic event such as the COVID-19 quarantine. Specifically, we investigated parents' and children's well-being, parental stress, and children's resilience. The study involved 463 Italian parents of children aged 5-17. All participants completed an online survey consisting of the Psychological General Well Being Index (PGWB) to assess parental well-being, the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) to measure children's well-being, the Parent Stress Scale (PSS) to investigate parental stress, and the Child and Youth Resilience Measure (CYRM-R) to measure children's resilience. The results show that confinement measures and changes in daily routine negatively affect parents' psychological dimensions, thus exposing children to a significant risk for their well-being. Our results also detect some risk factors for psychological maladjustments, such as parental stress, lower levels of resilience in children, changes in working conditions, and parental psychological, physical, or genetic problems. In this study, we attempted to identify the personal and contextual variables involved in the psychological adjustment to the COVID-19 quarantine to identify families at risk for maladjustment and pave the way for ad hoc intervention programs intended to support them. Our data show promising results for the early detection of the determinants of families' psychological health. It is important to focus attention on the needs of families and children-including their mental health-to mitigate the health and economic implications of the COVID-19 pandemic."
1978,Coastal flood risks in China through the 21st century - An application of DIVA,"Fang, Jiayi; Lincke, Daniel; Brown, Sally; Nicholls, Robert J.; Wolff, Claudia; Merkens, Jan-Ludolf; Hinkel, Jochen; Vafeidis, Athanasios T.; Shi, Peijun; Liu, Min","China experiences frequent coastal flooding, with nearly US$ 77 billion of direct economic losses and over 7,000 fatalities reported from 1989 to 2014. Flood damages are likely to grow due to climate change induced sea-level rise and increasing exposure if no further adaptation measures are taken. This paper quantifies potential damage and adaptation costs of coastal flooding in China over the 21st Century, including the effects of sea-level rise. It develops and utilises a new, detailed coastal database of China developed within the Dynamic Interactive Vulnerability Assessment (DIVA) model framework. The refined database provides a more realistic spatial representation of coasts, with more than 2700 coastal segments, covering 28,966 km of coastline. Over 50% of China's coast is artificial, representing defended coast and/or claimed land. Coastal flood damage and adaptation costs for China are assessed for different Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) and Shared Socio-economic Pathways (SSP) combinations representing climate change and socio-economic change and two adaptation strategies: no upgrade of currently existing defences and maintaining current protection levels. By 2100, 0.7-20.0 million people may be flooded/yr and US$ 67-3,308 billion damages/yr are projected without upgrade to defences. In contrast, maintaining the current protection level would reduce those numbers to 0.2-0.4 million people flooded/yr and US$ 22-60 billion/yr flood costs by 2100, with protection investment costs of US$ 8-17 billion/yr. In 2100, maintaining current protection levels, dikes costs are two orders of magnitude smaller than flood costs across all scenarios, even without accounting for indirect damages. This research improves on earlier national assessments of China by generating a wider range of projections, based on improved datasets. The information delivered in this study will help governments, policy-makers, insurance companies and local communities in China understand risks and design appropriate strategies to adapt to increasing coastal flood risk in an uncertain world.

1979,Three-scope carbon emission inventories of global cities,"Wiedmann, Thomas; Chen, Guangwu; Owen, Anne; Lenzen, Manfred; Doust, Michael; Barrett, John; Steele, Kristian","A major challenge for cities taking action on climate change is assessing and managing the contribution of urban consumption which triggers greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions outside city boundaries. Using a novel method of creating city-level input-output tables, we present the first consistent, large-scale, and global assessment of three-scope GHG inventories for 79 members of the C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group. These inventories cover the emissions from sources located within city boundaries (Scope 1), emissions occurring as a consequence of the use of grid-supplied electricity, heat, steam, and/or cooling (Scope 2), and all other GHG emissions that occur outside the city boundary as a result of activities taking place within the city (Scope 3). We find that, by only accounting for territorial emissions, without Scope 3, the 79 C40 cities under-report 4% of global annual GHG emissions from six key infrastructure-related transboundary sources (73%) and from service-related sectors (27%). In contrast, when only accounting for consumption-based emissions, the C40 cities would miss the mitigation target on 41% of their territorial emissions. We argue that cities should complement their GHG inventories, adding full Scope 3 to Scopes 1 and 2, and develop low-carbon consumption strategies in addition to current infrastructure-focused action on climate change."

The 3D model of the tooth and the endodontic instrument has been created using computer-aided design software. The nonlinear explicit dynamic analysis in the CAE package (ANSYS) has been used to analyse the mechanical behaviour of endodontic instruments such as total deformation, equivalent elastic strain, and equivalent stress during canal preparation. The mechanical behaviour of three commercially available endodontic NiTi alloy instruments such as WaveOne Gold (WOG), 2Shape 1 (TS1) and 2Shape 2 (TS2) endodontic files was evaluated using FEA. Consequently, the effect of deformation, equivalent stress and equivalent elastic strain on endodontic files during cleaning and shaping are investigated and compared. The results show that the total deformation and equivalent elastic strain are maximum in the TS1 endodontic file in comparison to TS2 and WOG files."
1981,"Environmental consequences of population, affluence and technological progress for European countries: A Malthusian view","Nhat Minh Pham; Toan Luu Duc Huynh; Nasir, Muhammad Ali","This paper examines the short-run and long-run effects of economic, sociological and energy factors on environmental degradation in 28 European countries. In so doing, we employ Panel Vector Autoregressive (PVAR) and Fully Modified OLS (FMOLS) approaches on data from 1990 to 2014 in a STIRPAT (Stochastic Impacts by Regression on Population, Affluence, and Technology) framework. Key empirical results indicate that these factors may contribute to environmental improvement in the short run; however, there are adverse implications in the long-run. Specifically, economic factors including economic growth, trade openness and foreign direct investment cause environmental degradation in the under-analysis economies. The sociological factors as measured by the population growth and the level of urbanization also show a negative impact on the environmental degradation in the short-run but in the long run, both population size and urbanization increase environmental degradation. These findings are in line with the concerns raised by Thomas Robert Malthus in his Essay on the Principle of Population. With regards to the energy factors, it indicates that the renewable energies help the European environment by reducing the level of carbon dioxide emissions whereas the higher energy intensity is an ecological threat. Our results remain robust in the EKC framework."

Flight in the challenging ultra-low-density Martian environment can be achieved with properly scaled bioinspired flapping wing vehicle configurations that utilize the same high lift producing mechanisms that are employed by insects on Earth. Through dynamic scaling of wings and kinematics, we investigate the ability to generate solutions for a broad range of flapping wing flight vehicles masses ranging from insects O(10-3) kg to the Mars helicopter Ingenuity O(100) kg. A scaling method based on a neural-network trained on 3D Navier-Stokes solutions is proposed to determine approximate wing size and kinematic values that generate bioinspired hover solutions. We demonstrate that a family of solutions exists for designs that range from 1 to 1000 grams, which are verified and examined using a 3D Navier-Stokes solver. Our results reveal that unsteady lift enhancement mechanisms, such as delayed stall and rotational lift, are present in the bioinspired solutions for the scaled vehicles hovering in Martian conditions. These hovering vehicles exhibit payloads of up to 1 kg and flight times on the order of 100 minutes when considering the respective limiting cases of the vehicle mass being comprised entirely of payload or entirely of a battery and neglecting any transmission inefficiencies. This method can help to develop a range of Martian flying vehicle designs with mission viable payloads, range, and endurance."
1983,Non-linear threshold effect of financial development on renewable energy consumption: evidence from panel smooth transition regression approach,"Raza, Syed Ali; Shah, Nida; Qureshi, Muhammad Asif; Qaiser, Shahzad; Ali, Ramsha; Ahmed, Farhan","Financial development is identified as one of the significant factors that affect energy consumption and has been widely discussed in the literature. However, the association between financial development and renewable energy consumption is still at its earlier stage and is limitedly explored. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to examine the non-linear association between financial development and renewable energy consumption in the top renewable energy consumption countries. The study utilized the newly introduced econometric technique panel smooth transition regression (PSTR) model with two regimes on annual panel data consisted of years 1997-2017. The result confirmed that all the financial development indicators increase renewable energy consumption but affect renewable energy consumption differently. Moreover, the economic growth and industrial structure showed a positive and significant association in both regimes, whereas the population showed a negative relationship with renewable energy consumption in a low growth regime but the association becomes positive in high growth regimes. The study suggested several policies for the top renewable consumption countries."

The enzyme had a specific activity of 4,377.65 ± 55.37 U/mg towards polygalacturonic acid, and the Km and Vmax values of PoxaEnPG28C were calculated as 1.64 g/l and 6127.45 U/mg, respectively. PoxaEnPG28C increased the light transmittance of orange, lemon, strawberry and hawthorn juice by 13.9 ± 0.3%, 29.4 ± 3.8%, 95.7 ± 10.2% and 79.8 ± 1.7%, respectively; it reduced the viscosity of the same juices by 25.7 ± 1.6%, 52.0 ± 4.5%, 48.2 ± 0.7% and 80.5 ± 2.3%, respectively, and it increased the yield of the juices by 24.5 ± 0.7%, 12.7 ± 2.2%, 48.5 ± 4.2% and 104.5 ± 6.4%, respectively. Thus, PoxaEnPG28C could be considered an excellent candidate enzyme for acidic fruit juice production. Remarkably, fruit juice production using hawthorn as an material was reported for the first time."
1985,Key policies to the development of construction and demolition waste recycling industry in China,"Li, Jingru; Yao, Yun; Zuo, Jian; Li, Jinggang","There is a growing need to recycle construction and demolition waste (CDW) in order to treat the huge amount of CDW in many metropolises of China. However, the CDW recycling industry is still in its initial stage and developed unevenly across various areas of China. In spite of some qualitative discussions, the quantitative analysis of crucial policies to the development of CDW recycling industry was overlooked. Through literature review, nine influential policy instruments were identified in term of three categories, i.e. control and command policy, market-based policy and information-based policy. The stepwise regression analysis was employed to explore the relationships between the influential policies and the development level of CDW recycling industry in 52 sample Chinese cities. The results demonstrated that Green Product Label, Charge and Tax and Technical Standards had statistically significant association with the development of CDW recycling industry in sample cities. In the surveyed cities, Charge or Tax was the most common policy tool (84.6%), but Green Product Label (7.7%) and Technological standards (11.5%) were rather less frequently employed. According to the results, Green Product Label and Technical Standards should be given higher priority. In addition, landfill charge should be introduced as a fundamental impetus. These results provide directions for other cities to facilitate the development of their CDW recycling industry. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."
1986,Effect of transcranial magnetic stimulation on treatment effect and immune function,"Shan Liu,Xin Wang,Rui Yu,Yan Sun,Shan Liu,Xin Wang,Rui Yu,Yan Sun","To explore the effect of transcranial stimulation on the therapeutic effect and immune function of patients with post-stroke depression (PSD). Methods Selection in September 2020-April 2021 on the diagnosis of 70 patients with PSD as the research object, 35 patients were randomly divided into control group and intervention group and control group given conventional treatment, the intervention group in the control group on the basis of the application of transcranial magnetic stimulation treatment, compare the curative effect of two groups of patients after the treatment cycle and the effects on the immune function. Results After treatment, the levels of DA, NE, 5-HT in 2 groups were significantly increased, and those in the observation group were significantly higher than those in the control group (P < 0.05). After 8 weeks of treatment, serum Gly content in 2 groups was significantly increased and Glu content was significantly decreased compared with before treatment. Compared with the control group, serum Gly content in observation group was significantly increased and Glu content was significantly decreased after treatment (P < 0.05). After 8 weeks of treatment, the contents of IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α in serum of 2 groups were significantly decreased, compared with the control group, the contents of IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α in serum of observation group were significantly decreased (P < 0.05); Before treatment, there was no significant difference in PHQ-9 score and MBI score between the two groups (P > 0.05). After 8 weeks of treatment, PHQ-9 score and MBI score in the two groups were better than before treatment, and the observation group was better than the control group (P < 0.05). Conclusion Transcranial magnetic stimulation therapy can not only effectively promote the synthesis and release of monoamine neurotransmitters in patients with post-stroke depression, regulate the inhibitory/excitatory amino acid neurotransmitters, reduce inflammatory response, improve the clinical treatment effect and enhance the immune function of PSD patients, which has clinical application value."
1987,Coal phase-out in Germany - Implications and policies for affected regions,"Oei, Pao-Yu; Hermann, Hauke; Herpich, Philipp; Holtemoeller, Oliver; Luenenbuerger, Benjamin; Schult, Christoph","The present study examines the consequences of the planned coal phase-out in Germany according to various phase-out pathways that differ in the ordering of power plant closures. Soft-linking an energy system model with an input-output model and a regional macroeconomic model simulates the socioeconomic effects of the phase-out in the lignite regions, as well as in the rest of Germany. The combination of two economic models offers the advantage of considering the phase-out from different perspectives and thus assessing the robustness of the results. The model results show that the lignite coal regions will exhibit losses in output, income and population, but a faster phase-out would lead to a quicker recovery. Migration to other areas in Germany and demographic changes will partially compensate for increasing unemployment, but support from federal policy is also necessary to support structural change in these regions.

1988,The double bipolar method for robotic total mesorectal excision in patients with rectal cancer,"Hidetoshi Katsuno,Tsunekazu Hanai,Tomoyoshi Endo,Zenichi Morise,Ichiro Uyama,Hidetoshi Katsuno,Tsunekazu Hanai,Tomoyoshi Endo,Zenichi Morise,Ichiro Uyama","Although meta-analyses and systematic reviews have clarified the benefits of robotic surgery, few studies have focused on robotic rectal surgery (RRS) and the use of Endowrist® instruments. Therefore, we evaluated RRS using the double bipolar method (DBM) and compared its short-term outcomes with those of RRS using the single bipolar method (SBM). This study enrolled 157 consecutive patients and all procedures were performed by the same surgeon and recorded through short video clips. We analyzed the patient demographics and short-term clinical outcomes. Although this observational study has several limitations, the console time for total mesorectal excision using the DBM was significantly shorter than that using the SBM. Although the DBM did not demonstrate a specific learning curve, it was a safe and feasible procedure even for patients with advanced disease. Further studies are needed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the DBM."
1989,ATP is an essential autocrine factor for pancreatic β-cell signaling and insulin secretion,"Sebastian Hauke,Jona Rada,Gergely Tihanyi,Danny Schilling,Carsten Schultz,Sebastian Hauke,Jona Rada,Gergely Tihanyi,Danny Schilling,Carsten Schultz","ATP has been previously identified as an autocrine signaling factor that is co-released with insulin to modulate and propagate β-cell activity within islets of Langerhans. Here, we show that β-cell activity and insulin secretion essentially rely on the presence of extracellular ATP. For this, we monitored changes of the intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+ ]i oscillations) as an immediate read-out for insulin secretion in live cell experiments. Extensive washing of cells or depletion of extracellular ATP levels by recombinant apyrase reduced [Ca2+ ]i oscillations and insulin secretion in pancreatic cell lines and primary β-cells. Following ATP depletion, [Ca2+ ]i oscillations were stimulated by the replenishment of ATP in a concentration-dependent manner. Inhibition of endogenous ecto-ATP nucleotidases increased extracellular ATP levels, along with [Ca2+ ]i oscillations and insulin secretion, indicating that there is a constant supply of ATP to the extracellular space. Our combined results demonstrate that extracellular ATP is essential for β-cell activity. The presented work suggests extracellular ATPases as potential drug targets for the modulation of insulin release. We further found that exogenous fatty acids compensated for depleted extracellular ATP levels by the recovery of [Ca2+ ]i oscillations, indicating that autocrine factors mutually compensate for the loss of others. Thereby, our results contribute to a more detailed and complete understanding of the general role of autocrine signaling factors as a fundamental regulatory mechanism of β-cell activity and insulin secretion."
1990,Empirical analysis of climate change factors affecting cereal yield: evidence from Turkey,"Chandio, Abbas Ali; Ozturk, Ilhan; Akram, Waqar; Ahmad, Fayyaz; Mirani, Aamir Ali","This research has examined the dynamic linkages among climate change factors, such as CO2 emissions, temperature, rainfall, and cereal yield in Turkey from 1968 to 2014. At first step, we tested stationary properties of the climatic factors and crop yield by using both traditional and breakpoint unit root tests. After the confirmation of given properties, we used the autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) model to capture the dynamic relationship among the variables in the given span of time. The empirical results show that there is a long-run equilibrium relationship that exists between climate change factors and cereal yield. CO2 emissions and average temperature have a diverse effect on the cereal yield, whereas average rainfall has a positive effect on the cereal yield in both the long run and short run. To check the causality, we use the Granger causality test that reveals a significant effect of climate change variables on the cereal yield. The unidirectional causal link is significant among temperature and rainfall factors. The results show that the cereal yield is affected by more climate factors like rain fall and temperature due to CO2 emissions as compared to land and labor use. Based on the findings of the study, few suggestions have been made to address the climate change factors. Devise agriculture-specific adaptation policy for the farmers to build their capacity and resilience to tackle climate changes, for example, farm practices. Agriculture research and development should work on cereal crop varieties that can tolerate the high temperature and precipitation. These policies could help the agriculture sector to sustain production and allocation efficiency in the long run."
1991,The operationalisation of sustainability: Sustainable aquaculture production as defined by certification schemes,"Osmundsen, Tonje C.; Amundsen, Vilde S.; Alexander, Karen A.; Asche, Frank; Bailey, Jennifer; Finstad, Bengt; Olsen, Marit Schei; Hernandez, Klaudia; Salgado, Hugo","Sustainability certification has become an increasingly important feature in aquaculture production, leading to a multitude of schemes with various criteria. However, the large number of schemes and the complexity of the standards creates confusion with respect to which sustainability objectives are targeted. As a result, what is meant by `sustainability' is unclear. In this paper, we examine the operationalisation of the concept from the vantage point of the certifying authorities, who devise standards and grant or withhold certification of compliance. We map the criteria of eight widely-used certification schemes using the four domains of the Wheel of Sustainability, a reference model designed to encompass a comprehensive understanding of sustainability. We show that, overall, the sustainability certifications have an overwhelming focus on environmental and governance indicators, and only display scattered attempts at addressing cultural and economic issues. The strong focus on governance indicators is, to a large degree, due to their role in implementing and legitimising the environmental indicators. The strong bias implies that these certification schemes predominantly focus on the environmental domain and do not address sustainability as a whole, nor do they complement each other. Sustainability is by definition and by necessity a comprehensive concept, but if the cultural and economic issues are to be addressed in aquaculture, the scope of certification schemes must be expanded. The Wheel of Sustainability can serve as a valid lexicon and asset to guide such efforts."
1992,Short Food Supply Chains (SFSC) as Local and Sustainable Systems,"Jarzebowski, Sebastian; Bourlakis, Michael; Bezat-Jarzebowska, Agnieszka","We distinguish different types of Short Food Supply Chains (SFSC); nevertheless, their common main characteristic relate to reduced numbers of intermediaries between farmers/food producers and consumers. The aim of the paper is to present the SFSCs as local and sustainable food systems with their possible development. The SFSC idea follows the concept of sustainability, which is based on three pillars: environmental, social, and economic. In the paper, the authors also highlight other barriers to growth, and challenges faced by local food systems."
1993,"﻿New and poorly known ""araphid"" diatom species (Bacillariophyta) from regions near Lake Titicaca, South America and a discussion on the continued use of morphological characters in ""araphid"" diatom taxonomy","Eduardo A Morales,Carlos E Wetzel,Luc Ector,Eduardo A Morales,Carlos E Wetzel,Luc Ector","Based on two Andean Altiplano samples and on light and scanning electron microscopy analyses, we present six new species of ""araphid"" diatoms in the genus Pseudostaurosira, P.aedes sp. nov., P.frankenae sp. nov., P.heteropolaris sp. nov., P.oblonga sp. nov., P.occulta sp. nov., and P.pulchra sp. nov. Additional data are provided for four other known taxa, Nanofrustulumcataractarum, N.rarissimum, P.sajamaensis and P.vulpina, the latter species corresponding to a stat. nov. based on a variety of P.laucensis. Each taxon is described morphologically and compared with closely related published taxa, using characters such as axial area, virgae, vimines, areolar shape, volae, internal striae depositions, spines, flaps and apical pore fields, which are not usually used for species distinction within the genus. It is our intention that the detailed morphological descriptions of each taxon and the elaborate comparative tables we provide serve as a basis for correction of neo and paleo-databases for the Altiplano to produce a better account of autecological data and ecological change in the region. Some arguments for our continued use of a morphologically based approach are given in the context of rapid environmental degradation in the Andes and the difficulties in applying molecular approaches in countries such as Bolivia."
1994,"Augmenting the effect of virtual labs with ""teacher demonstration"" and ""student critique"" instructional designs to scaffold the development of scientific literacy","Chen-Chung Liu,Cai-Ting Wen,Hsin-Yi Chang,Ming-Hua Chang,Po-Han Lai,Shih-Hsun Fan Chiang,Chih-Wei Yang,Fu-Kwun Hwang,Chen-Chung Liu,Cai-Ting Wen,Hsin-Yi Chang,Ming-Hua Chang,Po-Han Lai,Shih-Hsun Fan Chiang,Chih-Wei Yang,Fu-Kwun Hwang","Virtual labs provide space for students to iteratively test, observe, and revise their understanding so as to improve their scientific literacy. However, one of the challenges that students face is that they need to think and act like scientists so as to be sensitively alert to methodological flaws and various sources of error. This study thus compared the effect of two instructional approaches using a virtual lab to enhance students' scientific literacy. Before students were given the opportunity to conduct science inquiries with the virtual lab, they were required to critique problematic inquiry cases (the critique group) or watch teachers' demonstrations (the teacher demonstration group) before taking part in the inquiry. By analyzing data from 50 middle school students, this study found that the effect of applying virtual labs can be augmented by an instructional design that engages students in critiquing experiments prior to their inquiry with the virtual lab. This study also found a limitation of the use of virtual labs in helping students transfer what they have learned from the teacher's demonstration to new inquiry contexts. A close relation among scientific literacy post-test scores, critiquing performance, and inquiry performance in the inquiry activity was detected, suggesting that student critiquing prior to inquiry is in alignment with the goal of developing students' inquiry skills and scientific literacy with virtual labs."
1995,The treatment of veterinary antibiotics in swine wastewater by biodegradation and Fenton-like oxidation,"Qian, Mengcheng; Yang, Linyan; Chen, Xingkui; Li, Kai; Xue, Weibo; Li, Yejin; Zhao, Huihui; Cao, Guomin; Guan, Xiaohong; Shen, Genxiang","Elevated concentrations and potential toxicities of antibiotics in swine wastewater prompt the exploration of effective treatment methods to minimize the amount of antibiotics released to the environment. This study examined the technical and economic feasibility of using combined biodegradation and advanced oxidation processes for swine wastewater treatment. The up-flow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) reactor was mainly responsible for conventional organic pollutant removal (i.e., a COD removal rate of 75%). The subsequent sequencing batch reactor (SBR) under a short sludge retention time (SRT) of 3 days removed the biodegradable antibiotics by >95%, and hindered the nitrification process which retained NW; -N and reduced operational cost (since the treated wastewater was intended to be used as a farm fertilizer). The subsequent Fenton-like oxidation (with the aid of citric add) achieved an average antibiotic removal efficiency of 74% under optimal reaction conditions: H2O2 dosage of 2.9 mM, [Fe2+]: [H2O2] = 1:3, [CA]: [Fe2+] = 1:1, pH 6.0, reaction time of 120 min. The superior treatment efficiency of Fenton-like compared to the conventional Fenton (74% vs 5%) under nearly neutral conditions was attributed to the chelating role of citric acid with Fe2+/Fe3+, leading to the enhanced Fe2+/Fe3+ solubility and therefore the promotion of center dot OH formation. This hybrid process of anaerobic and aerobic biodegradation and Fenton-like oxidation should be suitable and cost-effective for the treatment of wastewater with abundant conventional pollutants and persistent emerging trace contaminants.

1996,Socio-political efficacy explains increase in New Zealanders' pro-environmental attitudes due to COVID-19,"Taciano L Milfont,Danny Osborne,Chris G Sibley,Taciano L Milfont,Danny Osborne,Chris G Sibley","The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic claimed millions of lives and caused unprecedented disruptions. Despite these negative impacts, there is optimism the pandemic may shift public opinion on other global crises by fostering a sense of collective efficacy. Using propensity score matching to compare New Zealanders assessed before (n =12,304) and after (n = 12,370) nationwide lockdowns in 2020, we tested a preregistered mediation model with COVID-19 lockdown experience predicting increases in pro-environmental attitudes via enhanced socio-political efficacy. As hypothesized, socio-political efficacy increased after the successful nationwide lockdowns. In turn, socio-political efficacy amplified respondents' pro-environmental attitudes including climate beliefs and concern, as well as support for a government subsidy for public transport and opposition to government spending on new motorways. The pandemic also enhanced respondents' satisfaction with the quality of the natural environment, which was unmediated by socio-political efficacy. The crisis might offer an opportunity to foster collective pro-environmental actions."

This study included 60 female children with premature pubarche. We retrospectively collected clinical, laboratory, and radiological findings from all participants. We investigated the time interval between pubarche and thelarche in cases wherein premature pubarche was followed by thelarche. The mean age at onset of pubarche was 6.93 ± 0.79 yr old. Among the participants, 16.7% were preterm, 20% were small for gestational age (SGA), and 55% were overweight or obese. The mean time interval between pubarche and thelarche was 11.20 ± 7.41 mo. The mean serum DHEA-S level was higher in the preterm group (p = 0.016), and DHEA-S levels were generally higher in the SGA group (p = 0.004). This study documented the presence of being overweight or obese and having more advanced growth than their genetic potential in half of the patients who had premature pubarche. In addition to these identified risk factors, obesity-independent DHEA-S levels were observed to be higher in patients who had early puberty with the first six months of their follow-up considered to be the most critical time in predicting early puberty."

1999,Effect of Processing on the Structure and Allergenicity of Peanut Allergen Ara h 2 Roasted in a Matrix,"Xuejiao Chang,Xiaoya Zhou,Yu Tang,Ying Zhang,Juanli Yuan,Xin Li,Anshu Yang,Ping Tong,Zhihua Wu,Hongbing Chen,Xuejiao Chang,Xiaoya Zhou,Yu Tang,Ying Zhang,Juanli Yuan,Xin Li,Anshu Yang,Ping Tong,Zhihua Wu,Hongbing Chen","Peanut allergy is the leading pediatric food allergy. Many attempts have been made to reduce its allergenicity by processing. After roasting, Ara h 2 and its derivatives in the matrix were isolated by immunoaffinity chromatography (IAC). The structure and allergenicity of Ara h 2 were analyzed by circular dichroism, mass spectrometry (MS), western blotting, the enzyme-linked immunoassay, and cell modeling. Our results showed that a large portion of Ara h 2 was fragmented and cross-linked. Ara h 2 monomers accounted for only 13% of the total proteins after IAC purification. In addition, the structure of Ara h 2 changed after roasting. In addition to methylation and oxidation modification, the disulfide bonds of Ara h 2 were found to be rearranged after roasting. In the conformational structure of Ara h 2, the content of the α-helix decreased from 27.1 to 21.6% after roasting, while the content of the random coil increased from 29.1 to 34.3%. Six cleavage sites of trypsin were exposed, while three were covered. In terms of allergenicity, most of the cross-linking products were not recognized by patients' sera. Only one faint band around 40 kDa was observed in our blotting. For Ara h 2 monomers, roasting enhanced their IgE binding capacity and ability to stimulate the degranulation of basophils. The potential allergenicity increase of Ara h 2 monomers did not reflect the allergenicity change of Ara h 2 in the matrix due to the amount and property of its derivatives after roasting."
